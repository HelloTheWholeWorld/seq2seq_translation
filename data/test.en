• bill of lading or airway bill;
• certificate of origin; and
• sanitary certificate.
All documents must be French or in English with a French translation.
Commercial invoice:
At least two copies of the invoice should be sent to the importer.
There is no special form or consular legalization.
However, the invoice should contain the following information:
• date and invoice and customer order numbers;
• names and addresses of buyers and sellers;
• method of shipment;
• number, kind and markings of the package and numerical order;
• exact description of goods;
• quantity of the goods expressed in metric units;
• agreed price (unit cost, total cost, shipping and insurance charges); and
• delivery and payment terms.
Bill of Lading:
Either a straight or negotiable bill of lading is acceptable.
No consular formalities are required and shipments may be made freight collect.
Air cargo shipments require airway bills in place of bills of lading.
Certificate of Origin:
A certificate of origin certifies that the goods entering French territory are made in Canada and subject to duties, taxes and restrictions that apply to Canadian goods.
Providing a certificate of origin is recommended (although not always expressly required), especially for perishable goods that might otherwise be held up at customs.
Documents that need to authenticated, such as a certificate of origin, and letters authorizing an exporter's local agent to act on their behalf, must be first notarized in Canada.
At no cost to the exporter, the notarized documents can be authenticated by sending them to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Authentication and Service of Documents (JLAC).
Sanitary Certificate and Requirements:
Every shipment of fish exported to the European Union for human consumption must be accompanied by a single original numbered copy of an EU Sanitary Certificate.
The certificate must be signed and stamped by a CFIA inspector with an ink that has a different colour than the text of the certificate.
The shipment of fish must be available for inspection in Canada to be eligible for certification.
Exporters are advised to ensure that the original signed certificate is available when the shipment arrives in the European Union.
Duplicates are not acceptable.
Also, French authorities are entitled by virtue of EU regulations to insist that the information on the certificate be written in French.
Importation of Live Molluscs There are special sanitary conditions governing the import of live molluscs into France and the European Union.
These regulations can be found in EU directives 91/492 and 96/333 at: http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/en/search/search_lif.html (6).
Additional information on inspection, packing and presentation of live molluscs can be obtained from:
• http://perso.wanadoo.fr/jgodefroy/huitret.htm; and
• http://www.inspection.gc.ca/francais/anima/ fispoi/export/euueguidef.shtml. Certification Requirements for Live Lobsters and Wild-Caught Eels Live lobsters and wild-caught eels may be exported to France and other EU countries, provided the following statement is added to all certificates issued for live lobsters and eels:
The final step in the import control process is the physical check.
Inspectors will remove samples of the product in the shipment and perform a series of tests to ascertain compliance to EU requirements.
The frequency of physical checks performed on fish imported from Canada is 15%.
Labelling All marine fish shipped to France other than whole, round or dressed, head off or on, must appear on the list of species published in the official publication "Journal officiel de la République française".
This list may be updated by and importer in France or it may be done through the CFIA.
A copy of the current list is found on the CFIA Web site at http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/ fispoi/export/exporte.shtml. In addition, all labels should contain an approved Canadian establishment number and the word "Canada".
The proper order of appearance is "CANADA xxx" where "xxx" is the Canadian establishment number, as identified in decision 93/495.
Products exported for further processing by the canning industry require the above information on master cartons but not on inner packaging.
The certificate accompanying the product should indicate "for further processing" in the product description.
Labels must also indicate:
• product description;
• the list of ingredients by weight (for products consisting of more than one ingredient or containing additives);
• the net quantity in volume or mass in metric units (this is not compulsory for products that are subject to considerable losses in their volume or mass and that are sold by number or weighed in the presence of the purchaser);
• for products not intended for further processing or re-packing, the date of minimum durability or in the case of highly perishable food the "use by" date;
• storage conditions or conditions of use;
• instructions for use if required;
• frozen product must be marked with the letter "c" and the freezing date; and
• the identity of the European distributor must be displayed on consumer packages.
All products offered for retail sale in the European Union must also be labelled with the following information (7):
• commercial name of the species;
• production method (caught in freshwater, caught at sea, farmed or cultivated); and
• catch area.
Fresh fish entering France from outside the Eureopean Union are subject to further labelling requirements as set forth in EU regulation 2406/96 (8).
In particular, labels must contain information including:
• country of origin, printed in Roman letters at least 20 mm high;
• scientific name of product and its trade name;
• presentation (form);
• freshness and size categories in characters at least 5 cm high;
• net weight in kilograms of products in the package;
• date of grading and date of dispatch; and
• name and address of consignor.
Exporters need to confirm with importers and customs brokers that shipments are in compliance with EU and French regulations.
Shipments may be refused entry into the European Union if a problem is found in the document check, the identity check or the physical check.
When a shipment is refused entry it must be either removed from the European Union or destroyed.
Export Credit Risks, Restrictions on Letters of Credit, Currency Controls France does not impose restrictions on letters of credit or currency.
Generally, the method of payment is negotiated between the supplier and the importer.
The usual practice is for payment to be made by the terms of a letter of credit for 30-60 days.
In cases where distribution arrangements are concluded, exporters are advised to prepare a contract detailing all the major points of agreement as well as rights and responsibilities.
Cargo, Transportation and Storage France has one of the most highly developed distribution systems for agricultural and food products in the world.
Imported fish and seafood often enter France from other EU ports and are brought by truck to Rungis, the world's largest wholesale food market.
Rungis is located about 20.9 km south of Paris and offers a full range of products and services.
In fall 2002, the Rungis market began renovating its seafood hall.
Canadian suppliers should investigate opportunities and potential buyers in the Rungis market.
There are 893 000 km of paved highways in France.
French National Railways (SNCF) operates 31 940 km of 1.43 metre standard gauge and 14 176 km electrified and 12 132 km double track.
The Channel Tunnel project provides twin rail tunnels between the United Kingdom at Folkstone and France near Calais.
Separate passenger and freight service operate in the 49.9 km tunnel.
There are also two tunnels connecting France and Italy.
France has 14 932 km of inland waterways, approximately 7000 km of which are heavily travelled.
The leading destination for container and cargo ships in France is the Port of Le Havre.
Located 200 km North West of Paris, the overall tonnage of cargo passing through Le Havre reached 68.12 Mt in 2002.
The port is the major entry point for frozen products shipped via sea containers.
The two main entry points for air freight are the airports of Orly and Charles de Gaulle, both in Paris.
Some Canadian seafood products are flown into Amsterdam, Brussels and London and then shipped via road transport into France.
Goods may clear Customs with an EU transit procedure that provides for the issue of one document under which goods may be easily shipped across frontiers of EU member states.
These documents are completed by the importer, customhouse broker, freight forwarder or shipper at the point of entry into the Community.
Custom duties and taxes are not levied on product warehoused or withdrawn for re-export.
Merchandise withdrawn for consumption is subject to the same duties, taxes and formalities as if they were imported direct.
Government regulations determine the extent to which handling and processing may be carried out.
There are essentially two types of bonded warehouses: those used for storage and those in which further processing takes place.

Market Information Europe Fish and Seafood Sector Profile(1) - Germany Consulate of Canada in Düsseldorf Benrather Strasse 8 D-40213 Düsseldorf, Germany Contact:
Stephan Rung, Commercial Officer Tel.: (49-211) 172 171-0 Fax: (49-211) 359 165 E-mail: stephan.rung@dfait-maeci.gc.ca Internet: http://www.canada.de
MARKET OVERVIEW The European Union, which is among the world's top seafood importers, imported over 3 billion tonnes in 2002.
Germany imported over 20% (600 000 tonnes) of that EU total at a value of $2.7 billion(2).
That year, the leading international seafood exporters were Norway, China, the United States and Canada.
According to the German Federal Office of Statistics, total import of Canadian fish and seafood products in 2002 amounted to $42.5 million, of which $16 million was live and frozen lobster.
Germany imported over $160 million worth of shrimp in 2002, down 30% from the $230 million imported in 2001.
The seafood sector in Germany is made up of ocean fish (76%), fresh water fish (14.8%) and crustaceans and molluscs (9.2%).
Frozen fillets, Germany's main seafood import worth close to half a billion dollars in 2002, consists mainly (80%) of Alaska pollack.
Germany is also a large importer of fresh Pacific, Atlantic and Danube salmon.
Germany's pollack and salmon markets have been steady over the last 3 years.
Canadian exports of crustaceans to Germany have been steadily increasing.
Canada was the seventh-largest exporter to Germany in 2002 with a $15-million share of the $200-million market.
All seafood imports enter Germany via sea, through Bremerhaven or Hamburg, or via air through Frankfurt.
The infrastructure is in place at all ports to handle incoming seafood efficiently, such as integrated temperature controlled storage, as well as appropriate logistics and transportation facilities to deliver the products to their final destination.
Canadian exporters should note that EU countries exporting seafood to Germany benefit from lower transportation costs, no tariffs and a common currency.
In addition, being part of the European Union itself, Germany gives preferential treatment to other EU country seafood exporters.
Market Trends Fostered by an increased demand for seafood, overall population growth and diminishing natural seafood supplies, aquaculture is becoming more important as a source of seafood.
Currently, increased seafood demand in Germany is met primarily by imports and German processing companies are increasing their efforts to import from sustainable resources, including from aquacultural producers.
The United States has profited immensely from this fisheries practice and has managed to increase its market share of several seafood products by over 100% from 2001 to 2002.
Health and safety issues concerning European meat producers (such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and foot and mouth disease) have prompted German consumers to consider alternatives to meat products.
As a result, German seafood consumption reached record highs in 2001 at almost 15 kg per capita.
In 2002, consumption decreased a little to 14.3 kg, but is expected to remain steady.
Even though Germany has increased its seafood imports, there are certain factors affecting consumption that should be considered by Canadian exporters.
The rate of unemployment and the price of petrol and other commodities are rising in Germany.
As a result, many Germans decreased their discretionary spending in the first quarter of 2003.
This may have been the reason for the recent increase in lower-priced imports to Germany such as Alaska pollack, instead of high-priced products such as lobster and prepared salmon.
OPPORTUNITIES Canadian seafood exports to Germany can only increase as the European Commission implements tighter fishing regulations and quotas.
EU fisheries ministers agreed in February 2003 on emergency measures, to save from extinction several species of fish, mainly cod, in setting the 2004 fishing quotas.
However, in early October 2003, the United Kingdom's premier scientific body as well as other scientific evidence indicated that EU quotas are still above sustainable levels.
Cod and haddock are reported at less than half their strength compared to 30 years ago and scientists say cod stocks in northern EU waters are at the lowest levels ever recorded.
A final decision to a 45% cut for North Sea harvesting against the 2002 quotas was implemented, combined with compulsory cuts in the number of days vessels can spend at sea.
Total allowable catches were cut by 50% for haddock, by 60% for whiting, and by 5% for plaice.
All these recent implementations aimed at increasing the EU fish supply are compelling EU countries such as Germany to import more of their seafood from non-EU countries, such as Canada.
Another opportunity for Canadian seafood exporters is in shrimp.
About one third of the shrimps imported in Germany come from the tropics, where shrimp farmers use Nitrofuran to prevent shrimp mortality.
This practice has been banned in the European Union along with other antibiotics since 1993.
Strict EU enforcement of zero tolerance levels for trace elements of illegal antibiotics and other substances detected in imported foodstuffs has destabilized the supply of tropical, farm-raised shrimp from Asia, as shipments from leading producing countries have been automatically detained upon arrival pending laboratory analysis.
Another banned antibiotic is chloramphenicol, which has been detected in March of 2002 in freshwater crab as well as other fish products from China.
This has caused the European Union to temporarily suspend imports on a range of Chinese seafood products.
The European Union bans any product that has trace residues of chloramphenicol, which can be detected to a level of 0.3 parts per billion.
With the increased scare of antibiotics in tropical shrimp supply and the concurrent decrease of German imports from those countries, Canadian seafood exporters have a great opportunity to increase shrimp as well as other seafood exports to Germany.
Because of its population and market size, fisheries exporters to the European Union believe the European market is a growth market.
Canada should also consider exporting to other European countries such as Denmark and Norway, who are the main seafood suppliers to Germany.

KEY PARTICIPANTS As the German fish and seafood industry cannot satisfy domestic demand, Germany imports the majority of its seafood.
Germany imported 600 000 tonnes of seafood worth roughly $2.7 billion in 2002.
Germany's main seafood suppliers are Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands, together accounting for over 35% of German seafood imports.
As aquaculture becomes more prominent, large aquaculture producing countries such as Thailand, China, Norway and Chile are increasing their exports to Germany as well as their share of the total world seafood trade.
In September 2003, the July 2003 ban on Philippine aqua-culture was lifted.
However, the re-accreditation by the European Union of the Philippines as an authorized exporter of aquaculture products should not be a deterant for Canadian seafood exporters.
In 2001, the Philippines exported close to $15 million in seafood products to the European Union but less than $3 million to Germany, whereas Canada exported over $40 million.
Norway, already an established exporter of seafood products, has recently invested $13 million on a marketing campaign aimed at increasing interest and awareness of Norwegian seafood in Germany.
A major exporter of hot-smoked rainbow trout fillet to Germany is the Bulgarian fish breeding and processing company Reya Fish, which is currently exporting roughly 350 tonnes annually to Germany.
PRIVATE- AND PUBLIC-SECTOR CUSTOMERS There are several key customers in the German seafood market.
For example, German seafood processing company Deutsche See GmbH & Co is a leading German supplier of fish products, with 26 sales branches across Germany.
German seafood processing company RuegenFisch GmbH is a leader in eastern Germany's canned fish market, with a 29% market share.
It is also the second-biggest canned fish producer in western Germany, with a 12% market share.
The company processes 10 000 tonnes of fish annually, which is mainly imported from Denmark, Norway and Ireland.
German fish processor EuroBaltic Fischbearbeitungsgesellschaft mbH opened a new fish processing plant in Sassnits, northeastern Germany, in March 2003.
The plant has an annual capacity to process up to 50 000 tonnes of herring.
The plant is presently supplied by trawler and coast fishers, who have an average annual catch of 25 000 tonnes.
This is the first plant for herring filleting in Germany.
Royal Greenland, specializing in fishing, processing and selling fish and shellfish, plans to invest in a new production line for fish finger manufacturing in its factory in Wilhelmshaven, northwestern Germany.
The production is to be carried out in the first half of 2004.
After completion, the increased production of the group's current 100 000 tonnes of annual fish products will create an opportunity for Canadian seafood exporters.
The German fish market is dominated currently by discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidi, which hold a 45% share in the domestic fish retail market.
Generic fish market promotion is carried out by the Fish Information Centre (Fisch Informations Zentrum) in Hamburg.
It is open to private industry and associations and is funded through membership contributions.
Market-Access Considerations Canadian exporters should note that Germany, as an EU member, adheres to all EU regulations regarding imports.
German distributers are legally bound to ensure that all imported products adhere to German/EU food regulations.
Due to tight controls, it is essential that exporters ensure their products comply with local regulations.
Canadian exporters should also consider that:
• a quality and safety control mechanism adopted by Germany requires that all processors of aquatic product, including cold storage and freezer vessels, are EU- and/or Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP)-approved; and
• before shipping any goods to Germany, a written customs duty ruling called Binding Tariff Information (BTI) should be obtained from the local customs service.
A BTI is free and will prevent conflict over customs or excise duty.
Several countries, and the European Union as a whole, are developing new regulations for fish and seafood products that aim at identifying the country of origin and enhancing food safety.
As recently as 2003, legislation been introduced in Europe and the United States on country-of-origin labelling.
In addition, the EU commission issued a retail-level country of origin labelling requirement for seafood.
The Government of Canada has several programs to help Canadian firms gain a competitive advantage in international markets.
For instance, Export Development Canada (EDC) offers export financing and insurance to Canadian exporters.
Exporters may also find financial and other assistance through the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade's Program for Export Market Development.

ANNEXES
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Fish consumption has increased significantly in Spain in recent years.
In the period 1996-2002, total fish product consumption rose by 26.2%, fresh fish by 17%, frozen fish by 36.3%, canned fish by 34.2% and seafood, molluscs and crustaceans by 36.2%.
According to estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization, after Portugal, Spain has the largest annual per capita fish consumption in Europe.
On the world level, Spain ranks 21st in consumption, although it is the third-largest world importer, after Japan and the United States.
In 2001, frozen fish experienced the largest increase in recent years (with frozen fish growing by 6.3%, raising its weight out of all frozen seafood to 40%).
In other words, Madrid is the second largest market in the world based on the volume of fish sold.
The coverage rate is 70%.
In other words, more than 30% of the fish products consumed in Spain come from abroad.
Canada ranks sixth, after China, Norway, Iceland, Chile and Germany.
However, it ranks higher than countries such as Denmark, New Zealand, Argentina and the Netherlands.
On the Spanish market, frozen fish products are marketed through two channels –wholesalers and retailers.
• Wholesale distribution is mainly based on the MERCAS network operated by the crown corporation MERCASA.
More than 60% of the fish and seafood consumed nationally is marketed through the MERCAS network.
The figure rises to 95% if the areas of influence closest to these distribution centres, which are located in the most highly populated areas, are taken as references.
• Traditional fish stores and supermarkets sell most frozen fish (42.8% and 38.2%, respectively).
This is clearly reflected in the following figures: in 1995, 83.2% of all fish was eaten in the home and restaurants consumed 14.1%; in 2002, 75.5% of fish was eaten in the home and 22.08% went to operations that sell meals outside the home.
Last, the analyses undertaken for this study point to the following aspects:
• 1) Frozen products, particularly frozen sea products, have high growth potential on the Spanish market.
The figures show that the trend has been steadily on the rise.
Spanish consumers value the facility and ease offered by frozen products and increasingly believe them to be more healthy than other presentations.
• 3) Spain faces the problem of its dependency on foreign countries for these products and Spanish companies are addressing it with new investments to maintain their competitiveness and rescale their structures.
Business movements in recent years (mergers, acquisitions, partnerships with foreign companies) indicate that this is an emerging market and that producers and distributors are taking positions to enable them to face the future.
2.MARKET STUDY 2.1The food market in Spain According to information provided by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA), total spending on food in Spain in 2002 was €66,242 million.
This figure includes spending by households, hotels and restaurants and institutions.
The figure is €4,802 million higher than in 2001 (for a nominal increase of 7.8% or of 3% in real terms).
Growth in total spending is due to an increase in each of the market segments studied: 8.4% for households, 6% for hotels and restaurants, and 8% for institutions.
The main thing to note with regard to the structure of spending on food in 2002 was the scant change compared to the previous year and even over the last five years (1997-2002).
In other words, there has been a drop in the relative weight of vegetable fats, bread and cereals, and an increase in the share of fish, fruits and vegetables over that period.
Concretely, fish consumption has increased significantly in recent years in Spain.
In 1996-2002, total fish consumption grew by 26.2%, frozen fish by 36.3%, fresh fish by 17%, canned fish by 34.2% and seafood, molluscs and crustaceans by 36.2%.
On the world level, Spain ranks 21st in consumption, although it is the third-largest world importer, after Japan and the United States.
In other words, Madrid is the second largest market in the world based on the volume of fish sold.
It is worth noting that fish costs an average of 10% less in Spain than in the rest of the European Union.
2.2 Frozen products Billings or business volume of the 2,000 largest companies on the Spanish market for perishable foodstuffs amounted to €39,667 million in 2001, for an increase in sales of 10.8% over the previous year.
Based on the classifications of foodstuffs most widely used by specialized institutions (ALIMARKET, MAPA, MERCASA, AC Nielsen), frozen products account for a significant percentage of perishable foods together, for example, with fruits and vegetables, meat, eggs, dairy products, etc.
According to AC Nielsen, frozen foods account for 7.5% of total sales by food category.
Frozen foods cover a very heterogeneous set of products, with very different characteristics and properties.
Fish and seafood, both prepared and unprepared, are the largest family in the category.
Unlike vegetables, frozen fish saw the largest increase in recent years in 2001, rising to 340,000 MT (with frozen fish growing by 6.3%, raising its weight out of all frozen seafood to 40%).
The global market for frozen products in Spain (i.e. fish, vegetables, pre-cooked foods and even ice cream) is the fifth largest in the European Union in absolute terms (ahead of the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy).
The figures for frozen seafood were 2.9 kg per capita in 1996 and 4.4 kg in 2002.
Frozen food manufacturers are attempting to promote the use of their products in two ways.
On the one hand, they stress the ease and facility of their use as their main identifier for consumers.
On the other, the companies are also beginning to stress the healthy nature of this broad gamut of foods (particularly fish and vegetables).
Frozen Food Month was celebrated in March 2003 for the first time in Spain, as a way of promoting consumption of these products, informing consumers about their quality and dispelling myths.
The messages have stressed the nutritional properties of these foods and their ease of use.
The promoters have evaluated the campaign positively (campaigns of this kind have been carried out for years in the United States) and have announced their intention to continue it annually.
2.3 Frozen fish products There has been a very significant increase in the use of fish in the diet of Spanish families.
While 29 kg per capita were consumed in 1996, by 2002 the figure had risen to over 36.6 kg (see Table 1).
Looking in greater detail at developments between 1996 and 2002 broken down by category into fresh fish, frozen fish, canned fish, and seafood, molluscs and crustaceans, the following has been observed:
• The structure of consumption between 1996 and 2002 indicates that more fresh fish, more frozen fish, more canned fish and more seafood, molluscs and crustaceans were consumed (the slowest growth is in fresh fish and the fastest in frozen fish).
• Frozen fish consumption has grown by 36.3%, fresh fish by 26.2%, canned fish by 34.2%, and seafood, molluscs and crustaceans by 36.2%.
These increases are truly significant.
• By product, the marked growth in frozen hake/croaker and in canned tuna/bonito is noteworthy.
The only drop was in per capita consumption of trout.

Own, based on data from MAPA.
The market for frozen fish products made considerable headway in 2002 in the household consumption channel.
Hake continues to be the main fish, accounting for one third of the market in terms of volume.
Even so, the main relative increases were in species such as cod and salmon, which have moved from being sold in other presentations (fresh, smoked, pickled) to having a larger presence among frozen fish.
Molluscs have not performed as well, except for mussels, although the volume of frozen mussels sold is still very small.
Cephalopods have not performed well during 2002, owing to the increase in their price.
Table 2 and Graph 1 show how total fish purchases are distributed among households, hotels and restaurants and institutions, broken down by type of product.
Households take about 75.5%, hotels and restaurants 22% and institutions just over 2.4%.
It is worth noting that households have increased their consumption of fresh fish, institutions of frozen fish, and hotels and restaurants of seafood, molluscs and crustaceans.

In general, food consumption is seasonal, in other words, demand is not uniform throughout the year.
In some months consumption is high and in others it is lower.
Graphs 6, 7 and 8 show the phenomenon of seasonality for fish products, broken down by consumption, spending and price.
The results of the first two graphs are quite similar and, although it is risky to generalize, fish consumption tends to drop in the summer months and increase toward the end of the year – possibly because of the Christmas holidays when eating fish is traditional.
Contrary to what might be thought, fish prices fall toward the end of the year.
On the Spanish market there are three vectors that signal developments in the frozen seafood sector:
• The search for a rationalized chain of supply that offers regular supplies in terms of quantity, quality and price.
• An increase in prepared foods, with processing plants being set up in the interior and at the fishing grounds.
In recent years, the structure has been eliminating operators who add little value.
On the one hand, processes of vertical integration continue, led by companies that seek to have a presence on all links in the chain.
And on the other, companies from the primary and commercial sectors are building processing facilities to permit them to confer value added on the product.
Spanish fish production is an estimated 1.3 million tonnes, with a coverage rate of 70%, which means that it needs to turn to the foreign market to cover the demand of domestic consumers.
The European Union produces just under 7.9 million tonnes or just 7% of the world total.
About 81.5% of its production is from commercial fishing, for slightly over 6.4 tonnes.
Spain is the largest fishing power in the European Union.
There are already more than 150 fish farms and there is a clear growth trend in this area.
The companies that control the frozen fish market in Spain tend to be large groups, with mainly Spanish capital, although with a strong international presence (see Table 3).
In this sector, there is a clear trend towards mergers, which contributes to the process of business concentration.
The clearest example is PESCANOVA.
With the acquisition of PESCAFINA, PESCANOVA assured a contract to distribute products from the Moroccan firm Derhem Seafood in Spain and Portugal, involving 3,500 tonnes a year of cephalopods and other fish from the Alhajita fishing ground.
On the industrial level, it is investing in a facility to cook crustaceans and seafood with the capacity to process 60 tonnes a day.
In its commercial policy, it has wagered on convenience of its products (hake as a natural source of Omega 3).
It also offers the Cofrío line for the wholesale channel, the Caternova line for hotels and restaurants and the Friser Division for home sales.
Therefore, on the Spanish market, after the positive impact of the mad cow crisis began to wane, the frozen fish companies made a serious wager on rescaling to maintain their competitiveness and increase their market share.

The sector leader (PESCANOVA) sells about 120,000 tonnes of frozen products a year, followed by FREIREMAR which sells 82,000 tonnes, while the third-largest company sells about 55,000 tonnes.
Two other groups (AMASUA and BANCHIO) sell 45,000 and 40,000 tonnes respectively.
Taken together, there are more than 12 companies that sell more than 20,000 tonnes a year (PESCANOVA, FREIREMAR, AMASUA, BANCHIO, GRUPO IBERICO DE CONGELADOS, MARFRIO, PESCAPUERTA, FANDICOSTA, COGELADOS Y FRESCOS DEL MAR, EDUARDO VIEIRA, GALFRIO and CONGELADOS Y DERIVADOS).
One of the most significant aspects of the companies that produce frozen products in Spain is the major efforts they are making to sell products under brand names, which increases their profit margins.
The process is slow and bulk products and unprocessed frozen fish are still much larger.
2.5 Foreign trade As was said in the introduction to this study, fish consumption has increased significantly in recent years in Spain.
Consequently, demand for fish products by Spanish consumers outstrips Spanish fish production and imports are a basic need in the sector.
This circumstance has repercussions for the country’s macroeconomic situation, since close to 10% of Spain’s trade deficit can be attributed to imports of fish products.
This situation on the Spanish market has been a spur for the internationalization of many of the main Spanish companies, which have gained a foothold in other countries with large fish resources by establishing joint ventures with local partners that can channel part of the products into the Spanish market.
There are Spanish companies in Ireland, Scotland, South Africa, Argentina, the United States, Denmark, Namibia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, etc.
Another example is the main company in the sector (PESCANOVA), which has 85 companies in Europe, Africa, Oceania and South America.
Imports of fresh fish amount to about 217,000 tonnes a year, worth close to €665 million.
For frozen fish, purchases from abroad amounted to 348,000 tonnes, worth €468 million.
Imports of crustaceans – about 124,000 tonnes and €774 million – and molluscs – for 294,000 tonnes and €577 million – are also important.
Imports of frozen fish include 114,000 tonnes of tuna for the canning industry.
The Spanish market also buys 79,300 tonnes of fish fillets, 266,500 tonnes of molluscs and 127,400 tonnes of crustaceans from abroad.
Overall, it imports just under 805,150 tonnes of frozen fish products, for an inter-annual increase of nearly 5% over the previous year.
By item, imports of fish fell by 5.2% (particularly noticeable in the cases of sardines, monkfish and hake which were affected by rising prices, although balanced by the increase in the purchase of seabass and guilthead) but there was an increase in fish fillets of 18%, crustaceans of 17.7% and molluscs of 10.2%.
Imports rose significantly in 2001 and were the main motor for growth in the Spanish market.
Their average growth index during that year was 20.2% in volume and 22.9% in value.
The most relevant relative shares were fish fillets (increase of 32% in volume and 58% in value) and frozen fish itself (increase of 24% in volume and 36% in value).
However, the increase was smaller for crustaceans (increase of 15% in volume and of 7% in value) and molluscs (increase of 13% in volume and of 21% in value).
Argentina, clearly, and Namibia are the countries from which most frozen products are imported, representing 18.6% and 9.9%, respectively, in volume.
As for value, the two countries accounted for 20.3% and 8.8%.
It should be recalled that the breakdown of the fishing agreement with the Moroccan government has created a new scenario that is changing the balance on Spain’s foreign market.
However, Spain also sells fish products to third countries.
Its main exports are composed of 74,000 tonnes of fresh fish (€296 million), 367,000 tonnes of frozen fish (€339 million), 148,000 tonnes of molluscs (€294 million), 98,000 tonnes of canned fish (€316 million) and 32,000 tonnes of crustaceans (€129 million).
The final balance between exports and imports presents a large deficit of 260,910 MT and €1,334 million, placing exports in a very secondary position to imports, but which are seen as a very specific alternative for certain products where the market is mature and saturated.
It is worth noting that the average price for one kilogram of exported fish rose by 4.5% in 2001 (up to €1.62), which is exactly twice the rise for imported fish of just 2.3%, with an average cost of €2.68.
In the concrete case of frozen fish products, imports are far higher than exports, although it should be stressed again that on some occasions the imports are controlled at origin by Spanish companies.
2.6 Canada's position Canada is a country with a long fishing tradition.
Its fleet and industry have turned economic activities related to Canadian frozen fish products into an international benchmark for the industry.
In Spain, the Spanish Foreign Trade Bureau (ICEX) prepares different reports using data from the Statistics Division of the United Nations Organization.
Based on that information, the following graphs show the main exporters of frozen fish (based on its significance in value and volume we have chosen product 030420 – Frozen fish fillets).
However, it ranks higher than Denmark, New Zealand, Argentina and the Netherlands.
The following graph shows the world ranking of the main exporters of frozen fish fillets.
Canada has 5% of the share – for sixth place – and its share is similar to that of Chile, Germany, Denmark and New Zealand.
However, it saw a relative loss in share within that group of countries in 1997-2000.
The position of some exporters such as Germany and the Netherlands is noteworthy when we examine the potential of their fishing fleets.
Given the number of vessels and people who are involved in the fishery, they do not seem to merit such a high ranking.
One explanation lies in the peculiarities of international trade.
It is likely that third countries use Germany and the Netherlands as springboards for selling their frozen fish products and therefore, the final transactions with the importing country are included in their trade balances.
However, it is difficult to give exact figures and quantities, although they are probably significant.
Last, Table 4 reflects the imbalance in trade relations between Spain and Canada with regard to fish, molluscs and crustaceans.
Spanish exports are virtually non-existent, while imports are much more significant (the coverage of imports with exports is only slightly more than 3%).
This table is also interesting because it shows the time distribution of trade relations between Spain and Canada for this set of products.
Canada sells more fish, molluscs and crustaceans to Spain in April, June, July, September, November and December.

2.7 Distribution channels In the Spanish market there are two marketing channels for frozen fish products – wholesale and retail.
Fish that is unloaded from ships is sold on the 291 commodities exchanges – although in aquaculture, canned fish and frozen fish the process of vertical integration is very high.
From the commodities exchanges, the fish goes to the wholesale market – in other words, to operators who buy wholesale and then sell to small operations, fish stores, hotels or restaurants, but never to the final consumer.
As a cornerstone of wholesale activities, the MERCAS network sells 520,000 tonnes of fish products a year, 60% of which is fresh, 20% frozen and the rest is fresh shellfish (remember that MERCAMADRID is the second largest in the world after Tokyo).
More than 60% of the fish and seafood consumed nationally is marketed through the MERCAS network.
The value of the fish products sold by the MERCAS network in 2001 was €2,530 million, with €1,875 million corresponding to fresh products and the rest to frozen products.
Therefore, wholesale distribution in Spain largely depends on the MERCAS network belonging to the crown corporation MERCASA.
Today, there are wholesale fish markets in MERCABADAJOZ, MERCABARNA, MERCABILBAO, MERCACORDOBA, MERCAGRANADA, MERCAIRUÑA, MERCAJEREZ, MERCALASPALMAS, MERCALEÓN, MERCAMADRID, MERCAMÁLAGA, MERCAMURCIA, MERCAPALMA, MERCASALAMANCA, MERCASEVILLA, MERCAVALENCIA Y MERCAZARAGOZA.
Tables 5 and 6 give detailed information on volume and consumption for sales of fish and seafood by the MERCAS network:
• In total, during 2001 close to 520,000 MT of fish products were sold at the MERCASA centres for a value of €655 million.
• Frozen products distributed through the network amounted to nearly 109,000 MT and were worth more than €655 million.
• MERCAMADRID, MERCAVALENCIA and MERCABARNA are the three distribution centres with the largest share in marketing frozen fish in the country (34%, 23% and 16%, respectively).

FRESH FISH FRESH SHELLFISH FROZEN TOTAL
MERCASA. The participation of retail outlets – in other words, shops that sell the products to end consumers – is an important factor in Spain’s market for frozen fish.
AC Nielsen gives the following figures for unprepared frozen and prepared frozen fish:
• Hypermarkets sell 30% in both cases (27.6% and 28.5% respectively)
• Supermarkets with sales areas of over 100m2 sell a higher percentage of unprepared frozen fish (21.6% compared to 15.9%)
• Supermarkets between 401m2 and 1000m2 sell slightly less than 20% (18.1% for unprepared frozen fish and 19.7% for prepared frozen fish)
• Small supermarkets, i.e. those between 100 m2 and 400m2 exhibit marked differences, selling 17.5% of unprepared frozen fish and 26.7% of prepared frozen fish
• Traditional fishmongers sell 7.1% unprepared frozen fish and just 3.6% prepared frozen fish.
Graph 11 summarizes all the information obtained from the database of the universe of AC Nielsen.
AC Nielsen The information prepared by MAPA gives a different statistical slant on the marketing of fish through the different retails sales channels.
In this case, traditional fish stores and supermarkets sell the largest volumes of frozen fish (42.8% and 38.2%, respectively) while seafood, molluscs and crustaceans are bought by consumers at traditional fish stores (almost 48%) and the share sold by supermarkets and hypermarkets is much lower (30% and 17% respectively).
The annex to this report gives the names of the departments or buyers responsible for buying frozen fish for the main chains of Spanish supermarkets and hypermarkets.
The price variable is fundamental for consumer decisions.
An examination of the price per unit of frozen fish indicates that traditional fish stores are the cheapest channel, followed by the supermarket and the hypermarket.
The most expensive channel is direct-to-home sales.
With respect to the price per unit of seafood, molluscs and crustaceans, traditional shops, supermarkets, hypermarkets and direct-to home sales offer the most competitive prices, in descending order.
As mentioned in the introduction to this study, fish in Spain costs 10% less than the European Community average, with the price being very similar to the price on the Portuguese market.
Last, the phenomenon of brand names in the retail trade in frozen fish products should be kept in mind.
2.8 The hotel and restaurant channel This channel refers to the consumption of food by individuals in establishments that specialize in preparing it, which offer a series of complementary services that determine the customer's choice.
They can be divided into restaurants of all kinds; cafeterias that sell cold or hot meals and beverages for a quick meal; and café-bars which are very complicated to measure statistically.
In 2002, the hotel and restaurant sector spent €16,485 million on food, for a nominal increase of 6% and of 1.2% in real terms, over the previous year.
This sector made purchases of 8,430 MT, for an increase of 1.5% over 2001.
Graph 12 shows the makeup of the sector.
Own, using data from MAPA.
The general increases in the income of Spanish families in recent years may have translated, on the one hand, into a drop in relative demand for fish for household consumption and, on the other, into an increase in meals taken in restaurants.
In both 1995 and in 2002 the relative share of institutions in fish consumption was 2.5%.
Graph 13 shows relative demand by households, restaurants and institutions for 2002, broken down by the different subgroups of products.
Own based on data from MAPA (2003).
For hotels and restaurants, fish products are mainly marketed by distributors (48.5%), wholesalers (18.8%) and traditional shops (17.4%) as shown in Graph 14.
Own, based on data from MERCASA.
In recent years, the hotel and restaurant channel has been helping to expand and diversify the market of the main frozen fish companies in Spain.
The following examples can be given:
It is negotiating with GRUPO ZENA DE RESTAURANTES Y PARQUES REUNIDOS to introduce its products in these segments (sales through this channel are forecast to grow by 35% in four years).
• PESCANOVA, as part of its diversification strategy, puts out the line "Caternova" for social and commercial establishments.
• FANDICOSTA, which has wagered on the brand strategy, has a line intended for the hotel and restaurant channel, sold in 2.5 kg packages.
It should be kept in mind that there is a clear relationship in the Spanish market between frozen fish products, hotel and restaurant activities and tourism.
In 2002, the operators consulted agreed that the poor tourist season had slowed the advance of this channel.
To end, Graph 15 summarizes the share bought by hotels and restaurants out of the total, for certain concrete fish products.
2.9 The legislative environment The sale of fish products is controlled in Spain by a series of regulations, both domestic and Community, designed to obtain proper market functioning and hence to improve relations among producers, distributors and consumers.
The regulations have been made compulsory as a result of the growing openness and globalization of markets, price stabilization at first sale and maintenance of market share.
For proper operation of the market, it is necessary to regulate sales, preserve the quality of the product, promote transparency in trade and guarantee the quality of the product for the end consumer.
In the European Union, frozen fish is treated as a prepared product and therefore it is not subject to all the rules that apply to fresh fish.
Another relevant issue is that a great deal of frozen fish is produced aboard factory ships and can be bought or sold without the need to go to a port.
A factory ship does not dock in port except on infrequent occasions, since it is served by other vessels that take it supplies and carry its products back to shore.
Given these special features of frozen fish, two basic concepts have been established in European Union controls and regulations: standard quality and trademark.
The Spanish government has approved Royal Decree 1380/2002 establishing the compulsory information to be included on the label of frozen and quick frozen fish, shellfish and aquaculture products.
The new legislation came into force in January 2003.
By way of summary, the main rules governing the labelling of frozen and quick frozen fish products require that the following information appear on the labels of products sold on the Spanish market:
• Sales name: commercial name and scientific name
• The words "ultrafrozen" or "quick frozen", if applicable
• Best before date
• Storage conditions (storage temperature)
• Lot No.
• Net weight
• When the product is iced, "drained net weight"
• Name and address of the packer or manufacturer
• Production method (commercially fished, farmed, or fresh-water fish)
• Catch area
• Ingredients (the ingredients are not necessary if the product consists of a single ingredient)
• Health mark: a. Producing country (can be the country's initials in the case of European Union countries) b. Number in the General Health Register of Foods c. EC

ITALY Agri-Food Trade Synopsis January 2004
Michael Ash Trade Evaluation and Analysis Division Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada
The Government of Canada has prepared this report based on primary and secondary sources of information.
Readers should take note that the Government of Canada does not guarantee the accuracy of any of the information contained in this report, nor does it necessarily endorse the organizations listed herein.
Readers should independently verify the accuracy and reliability of the information.
This report is intended as a concise overview of the market for those interested in its potential and is not intended to provide in-depth analysis which may be required by the individual exporter.
Executive Summary Italy is a highly developed country, a member of the European Union, and a possible export growth market for select agri-food and seafood products.
The main reason for Italy’s overall small expected agri-food and seafood growth is demographics.
Over the next fifty years, the population, even accounting for the effects of immigration, is expected to fall while the median age increases.
Italians are quite conscious of food quality and prefer to purchase fresh, traditional, and more organic foods.
These preferences, however, are slowly changing as the acceptance of frozen and prepared products is growing.
Canada has a small presence in the Italian market, accounting for only 0.6 per cent of Italy’s imports in 2002.
Because of regulations, high tariffs, and discriminating preferences, Canada has been excluded from the market for Italy’s top three agri-food and seafood imports – pork, cigars and cigarettes, and cheese and curd.
Canada’s top exports currently are wheat, legumes and raw hides.
Growth commodities include seafood, pulses, organic products and furskins.
Overview of Italy Italy is a highly industrialized country with large regional variations in climate, tastes and economic circumstances.
The North, consisting of 40 per cent of the population has an average per capita income of $23,000 (USD), while the South, also with 40 per cent of the population, has an average income of only $12,000 (USD).
Despite these differences, Italians as a whole are interested in high-quality, fresh, and traditional foods.
A net agri-food and seafood importer, Italians are second only to the Portuguese for per capita expenditure on food products.
Future projections indicate that the population will decline by one million over the next decade.
These regulations are usually stricter than North American standards and have been used to, among others, reject imports of beef treated with growth hormones.
Domestic Agricultural Environment EU agricultural directives are mandatory across the regions but individual countries have the license to strengthen those regulations domestically.
Seeds deemed organic would similarly have stronger requirements than the EU’s organic level.
This proposal would increase barriers to entry for foreign seeds.2 Italy’s real GDP growth is average for the European region.
It is evident, therefore, that agri-food and seafood trade with Italy will not increase based solely on projected demographic or economic indicators.
Agra-Europe Weekly, October 10, 2003.
Trade Profile International Perspective Despite this somewhat bleak demographic outlook for the growth of the overall market, the development and composition of Italian tastes and preferences are changing.
Like North Americans, Italians, especially in the North, are demanding a wider variety of pre-packaged and high-value convenience foods.
This trend is characterized by the still low but growing prevalence and use of microwaves in the household.
Italy’s agri-food and seafood export performance has done quite well with gains over 36 per cent between 1996 and 2002, especially considering lacklustre pan-European economic performance over this period.
Italy’s main exports are displayed in table 1.
Its leading agri-food and seafood export is beverages.
Wine composed nearly 70 per cent of the beverages exported with a value of almost €2.8 billion in 2002.
Wine has also become more prominent in the overall share of exports by increases in both quantity and price.
Quantities of non-sparkling wine (i.e., table and fortified wines) exported by Italy increased 45.2 per cent between 1996 and 2002.
Edible veg.
& roots
Increasing 29.3 per cent over the period 1996-2002, the growth of this commodity was less than the growth of the overall market.
Table 2 shows Italy’s main imports.
Meat remains the country’s leading import, a market worth more than €3.0 billion in 2002.
Pork is the largest meat imported, worth €1.4 billion, followed by beef, worth €1.3 billion.
Poultry, on the other hand, comprises a very small share; its imported value lies at only €49 million.
Surprisingly, the prominence of dairy, eggs and honey is composed primarily by the import of cheese from Germany.
The overall sector, however, has seen only very small nominal gains between 1996 and 2002.
The increased demand for fish and seafood was evenly divided amongst almost all product classes.
As for beverages, the largest gains were seen in the import of beer and wine.
OVERALL Meat & edible offal Dairy, eggs and honey Fish and crustaceans
Cereals Animal and vegetable oils & fats Live animals
Animal and vegetable oils & fats Tobacco and substitutes Edible fruits and nuts Cereals
Most surprising, however, is the large increases in the amount of tobacco imported.
Bucking the trend of almost all other industrialized countries, Italy’s tobacco imports have increased by more than 46 per cent.
While per capita consumption of cigarettes in Canada and the United States has declined significantly since 1970, in the order of 40 per cent, Italy has actually seen increases of 13 per cent per capita.6 Table 3 SELECTED ITALIAN AGRI-FOOD AND SEAFOOD IMPORTS 1996 Value 2002 Value Growth (%) Octopus, not fresh or live 82.1 207.9 153.2 Yogurt 40.2 90.5 125.3 Prepared fish and caviar 280.8 538.9 91.9 Frozen beef 77.0 127.2 65.8 Frozen vegetables 90.1 147.1 63.2 Source:

The expansion of the import seafood market is huge, especially prepared seafood.
Furthermore, many items above are also high-value and processed goods.
Generally, these are sources to which exporters like to target for trade expansion.
Italy, however, still remains a nation that imports raw materials and exports finished goods.

were 67.3 per cent non-bulk while its exports were 87.7 per cent nonbulk.7 Canadian Perspective Between 1996 and 2002, Canadian agri-food and seafood exporters have not had as great as a success as other international competitors.
Overall agri-food and seafood imports from Canada increased only 9.3 per cent compared to the Italian import demand growth of 18.7 per cent.
Table 4 lists Canada’s top exports to Italy.
The two top commodities, wheat and legumes, are exports that Canada ships around the world and are primarily directed to developing countries.
The following three products exported are all either luxury goods or are used in the production of high-end retail products.
Not only do these goods have a high relative value, their growth as exports to Italy is quite large.
For example, Canada’s exports of crustaceans to Italy are more than three-quarters composed of fresh lobsters.
The commodity class has performed well, although the price at which Canada exports lobsters to Italy is below that of other countries.
The exported price per kilogram of fresh lobsters in 2002 to the US is $17.23, to France is $19.60, and to Japan is $20.68 while to Italy it is $16.91, below the global average of Canadian exports of this product.

The export of raw furskins to Italy has followed a worldwide trend in the increasing use of fur in fashion design.
The EU had serious concerns about animal welfare in Canada’s trapping methods.
Shipments of these to Italy have not been directly affected by Canada’s BSE outbreak in May, 2003, although because the beef market in Canada has been depressed, fewer cattle are being slaughtered and thereby fewer hides are being produced.
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Source:
Smaller regions that have made significant inroads into the Italian economy are displayed in table 6.
The greater appearance of Russian goods in the Italian market is paralleled by the fact that Italy has become Russia’s number one agri-food and seafood export market.
Part of this is the turn-around in the Russian agricultural sector.
In 1999, Russia was seeking massive food aid from the United States.

The peace reached in the Balkans has stabilized the region and thus promoted better trade.
Italy and Serbia & Montenegro are relatively close geographically with only the Adriatic Sea dividing them.
Most of the overall increased value can be attributed to high export levels of soybean residue.
Canada, on the other hand, has lost market share in trade with Italy.
As discussed earlier, some of Italy’s main agri-food and seafood imports are pork, wheat and meslin, cigars and cigarettes, and cheese and curd.
Disaggregating the specific commodities by country of origin can help to identify market opportunities.
The results are displayed in table 7.
Canadian Wheat Board
World Trade Atlas for year 2002 Pork
Much like overall trade, the large countries of the European Union dominate trade in the most valuable Italian import commodities.
Of pork, cigars and cigarettes, and cheese and curd, Canada has no presence in the Italian market for any of these products.
Canada’s pork exports to the entire European Union amounted to less than half of a million dollars in 2002, while the United States’ value is approximately $23 million (CDN) of a total US pork export market of over $1.8 billion (CDN).
This lack of market access stems from import requirements of the European Union that stipulate that all meat imported must never have been treated with growth hormones.
This issue, among others related to animal and plant technologies, have and are causing serious trade disputes between North America and the EU.
Like pork, Canada’s exports of cheese and curd to Italy were zero in 2002.
On the other hand, Canada’s exports of cheese to the entire EU totalled more than $30 million (CDN).
Part of this is certainly due to perceived quality differences between European and North American cheeses and Canadian supply management policies.
Italy is a large producer of cheese, making more than one million tonnes in 2001, compared to Canada’s 344,000 tonnes.
Italy, however, exports approximately 16 per cent of its stocks while Canada exports less than half that.
The lack of Canadian exports can be explained by the prohibitive tariff implemented by the EU at 57.6 per cent.
Canada’s duty on EU imports is only 12.5 per 12
FAO Statistics
cent.
Unlike American products, such as Marlboro, Canadian cigarettes do not have large international brand appeal that could profitably compete in face of such a tariff.13 5.
In some areas, Italy’s domestic production is better able to meet the domestic demand of its citizens over that of the EU (refer to table 8).
Where Italy noticeably imports a sizeable quantity compared to domestic production is in the areas of fish, seafood, wheat and pulses.
These are highly lucrative markets that should, at least for fish and seafood, see a large growth in imports.
The market structure of importing and retailing is quite open and competitive.
The South is still highly catered to by small mom-and-pop stores that are more hesitant to import a wide variety of foreign agri-food goods.
Whereas Canadian food expenditures are primarily focused on supermarkets, whose share of total food purchases is approximately 42 per cent, Italian purchases at similar stores account for only 29 per cent.
A relatively large percentage – around 15 per cent – of total food consumption is purchased in mom-and-pop stores.
In 2002, Italian imports of seafood products stood at 777,147 tonnes while exports were only 120,156 tonnes.
In value terms, Italy’s seafood trade deficit stood at $2.4 billion (USD) in 2002.
Declining seafood populations in the Mediterranean coupled with reduced effort (e.g., number of fishing days, number of vessels) have significantly reduced harvests for almost all species.
For Italy alone, catches have dropped from 465,000 tonnes in 1998 to 338,518 tonnes in 2001.
This is similar across other Mediterranean countries as well.
There is still a preference for fresh fish and seafood, but this is changing with tastes and demographics.
Italians currently consume 23 kg of seafood products annually, which should rise by around 5 per cent per capita over the next five years.
Their consumption is quite sensitive to price changes.
For further information of the Italian pulse market, refer to the Agri-Food Trade Service website (http://ats.agr.ca/info/europe-e.htm#Italy). Unlike North America, the organic food market is highly developed and shows considerable growth.
Over the next three years, sales of organic food are expected to reach $7.3 billion and 3.3 per cent of Italy’s entire food consumption.
Facilitating this growth is the projected accessibility of these goods as 60 per cent of organic goods are expected to be sold in supermarkets by 2004.17 The Italian hotel and restaurant industry is smaller only to that of the United States.
Hotels in Italy number 33,000 but only a small percentage, around two per cent, are international hotel chains.
The growth of restaurants has been fuelled by the 141 per cent increase in the number of meals consumed outside the home in the past ten years.
Much of this growth has been in North American-style restaurants and other foreign foods, such as sushi.
As with many primary agricultural products in the EU, future prospects for export opportunities are heavily reliant on the degree of market access, especially the level of tariffs.
This is certainly true of tobacco and grains.
Until such time that international negotiations

TURKEY Agri-Food Trade Synopsis
January 2004
Executive Summary Although Turkey is ideally situated in both Europe and Asia and has been undergoing major internal reforms, its demand for foreign agrifood and seafood products has remained highly variable.
A confusing and unpredictable system of agricultural support, tariffs and other barriers to trade discourages exporting to Turkey.
With a reform project underway and a desire to enter the European Union, the country is on its way to overhauling its agricultural support programme.
Overview of Turkey Turkey is a country ripe for growth.
With greater economic prosperity, the people of Turkey are becoming more interested in Western goods and lifestyles.
This is partially signified by the increasing number of women working outside of the home.
Turkey has also been fighting to control its rapid price inflation.
Recently, the government has been able to moderate inflation such that it currently stands at 35 per cent per annum.
Turkey’s high inflation has not had an equal effect on all goods.
OECD in Figures, OECD (2001) United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.
Domestic Agricultural Environment Overall levels of agri-food and seafood trade with Turkey are growing even though individual commodities have experienced large fluctuations from year to year.
While part of this is due to the large uncertainty of prices, it is also exacerbated by variable levels of government support for agricultural producers.
The government has adopted a policy framework, the Agricultural Reform Implementation Project, that is being phased in between 2001 and 2005.
In an effort to streamline and modernize their agricultural sector, both to increase efficiency and to curry favour with the European Union, direct income support will be introduced in lieu of purchasing prices, compensatory payments, input subsidies, import tariffs, and export subsidies.
Although the reform programme itself is scheduled to be completed by 2005, the full effects of the transition of individual agricultural producers may take many more years to be realized.
Not only has Turkey reformed its agricultural subsidy programme because of large inefficiencies but also to align its policy with that of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU.
Turkey established a customs union with the EU in January, 1996.
A quantity index measures the physical shipments of goods, defined either by weight, volume or number, without the influence of price changes.
Between 1995 and 2002, the quantity of agricultural exports increased by 10.2 per cent.
Imports, however, displayed much higher growth.
Over the same period, the quantity index of imports increased by 49.0 per cent.7 This implies that, from a quantity perspective, Turkey is leaning towards becoming a smaller net agri-food and seafood exporter.
Furthermore, population growth exceeded 12.8 per cent during 1995 to 2002.
In per capita terms, Turkey’s quantity of exports appears to be falling while similar import values are rising.
With population growth very high in the country, this increasing gap can only be good news to agricultural exporters around the world.
The overall decline was only partially offset by the smaller decline of Turkey’s predominant export, edible fruits and nuts.
Prepared and edible vegetables both show increases with edible fruits and nuts rising over 50 per cent in quantity exported.
"The Common Agricultural Policy and EU Enlargement."
Note: the definition of agricultural products is not defined.
As of 2002, Canada exported only 279 tonnes of poultry to the European Union and this could further reduce that market.
Second, Turkey is unable to domestically produce enough feed for the increased number of birds and thus domestic import requirements of corn and soy are likely to rise, creating greater export opportunities.9

Turkey’s composition of imports is a stark contrast to most industrialized nations’.
These numbers may be upwardly biased because of the first point.
Turkey’s leading agri-food and seafood imports are highly limited to imports of non-food commodities, such as cotton and sheepskins, and therefore the high percentage of bulk goods imported.
Value is in millions of US dollars.
Other goods, especially those containing cocoa, have seen large increases.
Not a traditional food, this growth indicates a greater acceptance of the Western lifestyle and its tastes.
Animal food preparations, including pet food, also had large gains.
Canadian Perspective Canada had a large agri-food and seafood trade deficit with Turkey in 2002, as Canada’s imports from Turkey were valued at $40.2 million while exports were $14.8 million.
But, as mentioned before, Turkey’s trade patterns are highly erratic.
In 1997, Canada’s agri-food and seafood exports to Turkey totalled $116.9 million while in 1993 they were only $7.4 million.
Much of this can be explained by the large and pervasive government involvement in the agricultural marketplace that can quickly change tariffs, quotas and other barriers to protect domestic producers.
The variability of trade is apparent when considering the 13

The largest item, dried leguminous vegetables, had an imported value by Turkey of $28.5 million in 1999.
On the other hand, 2002 proved the first year since at least 1992 that either soybean oilcake or corn was ever exported to Turkey from Canada.

CATS. Value is in thousands of Canadian dollars
Whereas almost all other products have seen declines, the sustained increased value of animal feed preparations (including dog and cat food) from year-to-year demonstrates that some exports to Turkey, especially of a highly specialized and processed nature, can repeatedly do well.
Lentils have always been a large commodity in Canadian-Turkish trade.
From January to November 2003, Canada’s exports of lentils, which are almost the only type of legume exported, were valued at $8.1 million.
Moreover, Canada provides for more than half of Turkey’s annual imports.
International Competitors Turkey’s imports display patterns similar to those of many other European nations whereby approximately half of agri-food imports come from the United States and the European Union.
The customs union entered into in 1996 excluded agricultural products because of inconsistencies in subsidy levels.
1993, less than 25 per cent of Turkey’s agri-food imports were from the EU; by 2000, the value had increased to 31.5 per cent.14 Trade with the Commonwealth of Independent States, however, has not accelerated following the demise of Communist rule.
With Turkey’s eastern edge bordering Georgia and Armenia, higher relative trade values may have been expected.
Sustained increases have been elusive.15 The rising importance of trade with the EU may be only because of increased co-ordination, but the growth market for Turkish agri-food and seafood trade may lie to the East.
Table 5 demonstrates that Greece has gained significantly from close relations to Turkey, even though there are disputes over Cyprus.
This is symptomatic of overall EU trade as discussed above.
While the United States has remained the principal exporter, the rise of Indonesia is particularly strong.
Indonesia effectively exports only two goods to Turkey: palm oil and coconut oil.
Not only were prices rising but also quantities shipped.
Thus, these two goods can almost completely explain Indonesia’s ranking.

As discussed earlier, some of Turkey’s main imports are cotton, wheat, corn, sheep and lamb skins, soybeans, tobacco, and food preparations.
Disaggregating these top imports by country of origin in table 7, it can be seen that Canada has only a modest share of Turkey’s main agri-food imports.
In comparison to Canada’s southern neighbour, the United States, even accounting for its size advantage, has performed considerably better than Canada in the Turkish market.
Especially in tobacco and corn, Canada’s relative exports have been low.

Value of imports is millions of dollars.
Note:
The numbers here are reported as stated by the respective countries).
One of the goods not listed above is soybeans.
In 2002, Canada exported no soybeans to Turkey.
The United States’ dominance of soybean imports (at 88.9% of a $206 million import market) can be partially attributed to legislative changes.
The US FAIR Act of 1996 increased support for soybean production such that acreage increased by fifteen per cent between 1996 and 2000 while prices simultaneously dropped by 36 per cent.16 Thus, US soybeans have a large advantage in world export markets.
Market Structure Domestic Consumption and Imports In comparison to the European Union, Turkey’s agricultural sector is highly inward-oriented.
As a measure of openness, the ratio of imports to domestic consumption (e.g., food, seed, waste) is calculated.
As shown in table 8, Turkey has much lower ratios for every major 16
U.S. Agriculture Policies:
Impact on Soybean Production, Bi-Weekly Bulletin, Agriculture and Agri-food Canada, Decemeber 12, 2000.
The ratio for meat is artificially low because of an import ban imposed by Turkey.
These numbers indicate both a current isolationist outlook and yet a promising export market for the rest of the world once their barriers to agricultural trade have been reduced.
There is significant room for expansion of exports of wheat, sugar and milk, for example.
Turkey’s relative imports should rise as she attains closer economic ties with the European Union.
Distribution of Goods Turkey’s food distribution system is still dominated by small vendors, known as bakkals.
On the decline, these merchants account for more than half of retail food sales in a $23 billion (US) market.
Whereas they composed 76 per cent of sales in 1994, by 2000 they commanded only 53 per cent of the market share.
This decline was precipitated by the rise of supermarkets and other large retailers.
Over the same time frame, supermarkets have come to represent 26 per cent of food sales from only 5 per cent.17 Supermarkets typically attract middle- and high-income earners, in a country where a large proportion of income is spent on food.
As a result of this shift away from traditional markets, distribution channels are also evolving.
Previously, an importer would purchase foreign goods and would either sell directly to the large supermarkets or sell to a wholesaler who in turn would distribute the product to bakkals and small markets.
Increasingly, however, foreign exporters are selling directly to the larger supermarkets and bypassing middlemen altogether.
Not only does this reduce the shelf price of the imported goods, but also provides greater opportunities for new products to enter the 17
Bakkals are common markets, accessible by all, and usually carry local products.
While corporations such as Migros operate 450 stores nationwide and are a Turkish firm, there are also players such as Carrefour and Champion SA of France that have entered into a joint venture with a Turkish firm.
Together they manage approximately 50 stores.
German, British and American interests are also represented in supermarket ownership throughout the country.
These facts bring to light two important issues.
First, competition is not concentrated in this market.
Although there are two main players, there are a significant number of junior chains in a rapidly expanding market.
Thus, there is little fear of constrained competition.
Second, the presence of European and American companies in the Turkish market more easily enables the import and promotion of Western goods.
On the other hand, of those firms, Europe dominates and as integration with the EU progresses, ease of access of European goods over North American goods could result in less market opportunities for North American agri-food exporters.
As seen above, the import market for meat in Turkey is virtually non-existent, as a current import ban on all meat entering the country precludes the possibility of meat import.
Although there might be initial opportunities if the ban is removed, long-term growth of the sector should be quite small.
Future projections for the domestic meat market show only modest growth.
Through 2008, cumulative population growth should be 4.6
Thus, by 2008, the internal demand for beef should only increase by 1.1 per cent, while for poultry, the value would be 1.5 per cent.
Along with possible accession into the EU, these markets cannot be seen to be large growth markets for Canadian exporters.
Organic foods, although on the rise, compromise only $3 to $5 million (USD) in a $23 billion (USD) retail food sector.
Growth is expected to be 50 per cent per annum until 2006.

Turkey:
These are areas where Canadian producers excel.
Canada has exported bovine semen to Turkey in the past and there may be increased future opportunities.
Pulses have always been important to Turkey.
As mentioned before, Canada exports a considerable amount.
Pulse Canada has identified Turkey because of its re-export of lentils to non-traditional and inaccessible markets for Canadian producers.
Although variable, the lentil trade with Turkey accesses both traditional (Europe and Asia) and untraditional (African and Middle Eastern) markets.
Overall, the major areas of growth on which Canadian exports can capitalize are primarily in the dairy market.
If the meat market opens, this also will be a considerable asset to Canadian exporters.
The closer links with the European Union, however, has the possibility of diverting even further trade away from North America and towards Europe.

RUSSIA Agri-Food Trade Synopsis
February 2004
Executive Summary Russia has the capacity to become a major agricultural player.
Modernization of farms and simplification of agricultural support mechanisms should result in more efficient production, although land reform and better functioning credit markets are also required.
Moreover, possible accession into the WTO and increased links with the EU should bring Russia onto the world agricultural stage.
Russia is a large agri-food and seafood importer, with an agri-food trade deficit running more than $7.5 billion USD.
Canada’s agri-food and seafood trade with Russia has been variable since 1999.
Between 1998 and 2000, Canada was a net agri-food importer from Russia; for 2001 and 2002, Canada was a net exporter, with exports valued at $72.9 million and imports at $68.6 million.
Canada’s main exports to Russia include meat, seafood and oilseeds.
Possible opportunities for exporters include the export of meat offal, pet food and water.
Overview of Russia After the fall of Communism in 1991, Russia was plunged into economic and political turmoil.
Rapid privatization of state-owned enterprises and uncertainty of the future caused some economic decline, though the agricultural sector did provide some cushioning.
Further uncertainty was introduced to the economy in 1998 with a large depreciation of the rouble.
Real GDP per capita fell but has more than made up the losses.
Agriculture was particularly hard hit with a significant withdrawal of state subsidies.
Since then, real GDP per capita growth has averaged more than 6.5 per cent per annum.1 Although some of this can be credited to rising oil prices, the World Bank estimates that GDP growth, holding oil prices constant, still exceeded 4 per cent.
Moreover, the inflation and unemployment rates have both been lowered in recent years.
Agricultural output has increased and the country appears to be more stable, both economically and politically.
Between 1990 and 1998, gross agricultural output fell by 45 per cent but then output increased 27 per cent through 2001.
However, levels are still 30 per cent below 1990 levels.
By comparison, the EU Table 1 Producer Support Estimates subsidy levels were consistently 1993 1997 2001 -24.4% 30.1% 10.3% higher but less variable between Russia 24.7% 14.3% 17.4% commodities.
OECD support remains relatively small, government intervention in the sector to protect domestic supply has been, more often than not, ambiguous.
For example, export tariffs on selected oilseeds were increased in 2001 from 10 per cent to 20 per cent in an attempt to make available more supply for the domestic oil and fat industry.
Bankruptcy among farmers is large and with few formal bankruptcies and the ability to continually rollover debt, there is little incentive to produce efficiently.
On the other hand, the devaluation of the rouble in 1998 made agri-food imports much more expensive and thus domestic demand was stimulated.
Rising domestic commodity prices infused energy and resource companies with additional funds for potential diversification.
These factors contributed to the rise of gigantic agricultural enterprises.
4 The full extent of their holding will not be known until 2005 when the first agricultural census will be performed since 1920.
As part of President Putin’s reforms, a new land law has been announced.
This law will partially free plots to be leased for up to 49 years to others, but not to any foreign person or organization.
Remaining is the discrimination in the issuance of permits and restrictions on foreign investment.
This is but one step along the path to greater agricultural efficiency and domestic production.
Where Russia has a relative domestic comparative advantage is in agricultural inputs (such as fertilizer and energy).
Within the country, it is advantageous to substitute meat production for bulk commodity production (such as wheat and sunflower seeds).
On the whole, however, Russia is not cost competitive in any of the main agricultural outputs.
As the agricultural market matures in Russia, movements to better reallocate resources should change the structure of Russian agri-food import demand.
Despite these factors, it is the policy of the Russian government to increase agricultural output in an attempt to reduce its dependence on agri-food and seafood imports.
One measure used to achieve this is the adoption of TRQs on a broader range of high-value products (such as poultry) while reducing import tariffs on corn and feedstuffs (to stimulate high-value domestic production).
Investments in Russian agriculture are rising, but they are increasingly coming from domestic sources.
With ongoing reforms, domestic investment should continue to increase.
As a sign of possible increasing foreign investment, the governments of Russia and the United States signed a MOU underscoring their commitments to greater investment opportunities in agriculture, among others, in May 2003.
The 1998 Economic Crisis In 1998, Russia faced its most severe economic crisis since the fall of Communism.
The effects of the crisis, brought on by the default on government debt and the devaluation of the rouble, were capital flight, higher unemployment, soaring inflation, and shrinking GDP.
The effect of the crisis on food consumption was negative, as domestic prices increased while incomes decreased.
For agriculture as a whole, however, the period following was a positive shock to the sector.
There was a large drop between 1998 and 1999, but the resulting real income increases rekindled demand for foreign foodstuffs.
Exports, even outside of grains, saw large increases in quantities shipped between 1998 and 1999, as the devaluation worked in exporters’ favour.
Finance and Development, World Bank, December 2003.
10 Economic Research Service, USDA, March 8, 2001.
Like most federal systems, national and subnational or regional governments share responsibilities that can affect trade, such as health and safety regulations.
In Russia, however, some regions have intentionally blocked international trade to pursue protection for local producers.
The central government has become more engaged in regional affairs to ensure that a relatively homogenous policy regime exists throughout the country.
Composed of most of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the CAM aims to have the free flow of agricultural products, food, and technologies.
Since being signed in 1998, however, little has come of the agreement.
Links to the European Union have been strengthened following the 2000 presidential election.
The EU is keen to improve relations between the two regions.
First, the EU is a large net importer from Russia, mainly in the form of energy, and wishes to solidify that relationship.
Second, the EU enlargement in 2004 will see the accession of 10 new states, many of them with strong economic and political ties to Russia.
These factors have led the EU to pursue the possibility of establishing a common economic space between the EU and Russia.
"Russia’s Bilateral Agricultural Trade:
First Results of a Partial Equilibrium Analysis" in Russia’s Agro-Food Sector:
Towards Truly Functioning Markets (eds.
Peter Wehrheim et al.), Kluwer Academic Publishers:
Because of the large devaluation of the rouble in 1998, inter-year comparisons of imports and exports directly around this period are difficult.
Where aggregate quantities exist, quantities exported appear to have decreased in 1999 but not to the full extent that values of imports and exports decreased.

Interestingly, the composition of Russia’s exports has changed dramatically.
Fluctuations such as these are common in countries in transition as agricultural producers slowly
Russia’s exports, which were 74.5 per cent non-bulk in 1999, have reverted to only 40.9 per cent non-bulk by 2002.
Their regression in agri-food processing may be caused by a better alignment of resources due to capital-to-labour costs.
Exports of wheat can be credited with a substantial portion of the rise in value between 1999 and 2002.
2002 was a record harvest year for Russian grain; 2003 should provide even greater exports of wheat.
Although wheat harvests are expected to be down from last year, increased world grain prices are expected to provide incentives for the export of greater quantities of wheat onto the world market.
The figure for 2003 is expected to be an increase in quantities exported of 12 per cent over 2002.14 Table 3 RUSSIA’S TOP AGRI-FOOD AND SEAFOOD IMPORTS BY COMMODITY

gains were in meat and its derivatives, while the largest percentage gains were in cocoa.
While pork and beef exports have stagnated, poultry imports have flourished, rising more than 425 per cent between 1999 and 2002.
The prospect for continuation of poultry import growth is limited.
Between 1997 and 2004, domestic poultry production will have increased by 320 per cent.
Furthermore, the government of Russia introduced a poultry quota in May 2003 that will limit imports and raise domestic prices, encouraging further expansion of the market by existing producers.
Some of these, such as shrimp and prawns, are very small markets and can be influenced by changes in domestic supply, such as catch sizes.
For shrimp and prawns, the import demand has been constantly trending upwards since 1999.
Other products, such as chocolate food and juices, have established markets that have been built upon over the three years.
Value is in millions of American dollars.

Canadian Perspective Canada’s agri-food and seafood trade with Russia is quite small, usually amounting to less than $200 million (CDN).
For the years 2001 and 2002, Canada was a net agri-food and seafood exporter to Russia; for the three previous, however, Canada was a net importer.
In 2002, Canadian exports were valued at $72.9 million and imports at $68.6 million.
As can be easily seen in table 5, Canadian exports to Russia in 2002 were highly concentrated in the meat and meat offal industry.
Because the value of overall annual shipments is so small, the percentage change values can be easily inflated with only a minor variance in trade.

International Competitors Surprisingly, Brazil is Russia’s single largest supplier.
World Trade Atlas
For the US, most of the decline can be attributed to decreased poultry imports.
It is difficult to fully ascertain the relative strength of a country’s exports to Russia because of the implementation of tariff rate quotas (TRQs) and import quotas.
Country-specific quotas have been used extensively by the government for imports of meat.
These provide considerable advantages to quota holders and present trade barriers, which are not easily overcome, to those that do not.

indicators will probably remain steady or even drop, as the full effect of the TRQs is felt.
Greater trade opportunities should arise.
Internal Competition Retail sales following the 1998 crisis have been strong, as revenues increased 25 per cent in 2001 over the previous year.
But the retail sector is highly developed only in the Moscow-St.
There is large growth in these areas both because retail space is significantly cheaper than elsewhere in Europe and currently only about 10-15 per cent of purchases are made in supermarkets.
Such corporations include Metro of Germany and Auchan of France.
Traditional foods will undoubtedly still be sold but products that also sell well in Europe will undoubtedly be introduced to the market.
On the whole, prepared and ready-to-eat food products are most likely to be retailed as the profit margin and transportability of these goods is much higher.
On the other hand, the presence of Europeans in lieu of North Americans may cause a preference for European-made food products over Canadian or American as sourcing from familiar, domestic suppliers is less onerous on foreign retailers.

Opportunities for Canadian Agri-food Exporters Overall agri-food trade with Russia should see sustained increases because of rising domestic demand that cannot be satisfied with domestic supply.
Previous econometric studies have estimated that households in Russia allocate between 60 and 70 per cent of total expenditures on food.19 Furthermore, Russia’s income elasticity of food is 0.617.
Income elasticity of food measures the change in food expenditures for a given change in income.
For example, an income elasticity of food of 0.617 indicates that a 10 per cent increase in income translates into an average 6.17 per cent increase in food expenditures.
This value is extremely high – most industrialized countries’ values are approximately half this elastic.
To put this in context, real GDP estimates of Russia’s growth show that between 2002 and 2006, real GDP is projected to grow by 17.2 per cent.
Multiplying this by the income elasticity of 0.617 yields a projected real growth in the demand for food of 10.6 per cent between 2002 and 2006.20 Using a different methodology, Export Development Canada estimates that Russian imports (of all goods) should rise more than 17 per cent between 2002 and 2004.
As for specific commodities outlined above, there are reasons that the large increases seen in the last three years will not necessarily continue.
Poultry exports are expected to decline slightly coming off their large import increases because of sectoral modernization and government intervention in the industry.
Much the same situation exists in the fishery sector.
Russia is a net exporter of fishery products, but reduced catches and a highly aged fleet have caused imports to rise temporarily.
As part of a modernization programme for the sector, the government of Russia plans to distribute quotas in less of an ad hoc manner while also boosting incentives for repairs of the Fock, Achim et al.

fleet, as 70 per cent of ships are below minimum standards.
These have also been enacted for pork.
Their purpose is to raise the domestic price to dissuade further herd depletion.
This will certainly reduce imports, as the tariff rate above the TRQ is prohibitive.
Meat offal imports have risen steadily and are poised to continue to rise as they are not subject to the TRQ regulations.
Not only has Canada increased its value of imports but also its market share.
The United States, however, controls 43 per cent of the import market while Canada’s influence is only 3 per cent.
It is believed, therefore, that there is room for expansion of Canadian exports of meat offal.
Because of the TRQs imposed on beef, pork and poultry, Canadian exports of these products are expected to decline, as mentioned above.
Attesting to this is the number of visits Russian producers have made to Canadian suppliers of high-quality genetics.
Although slightly different, exports of pet food may be an expanding market.
Russia’s imports are relatively small – $22 million USD – but rising incomes and the emergence of the middle class may extend the current increasing trend.
In 2002, Canada did not export water to Russia in a market worth more than $20 million USD.
22 Livestock and Products Annual:
Butter imports are expected to rise by 35 per cent over the same period.
Because of supply management practices in Canada, however, the prospect for this rapidly increasingly market will appear to be unchallenged.23 Vegetable oil consumption per capita in Russia is approximately half that of the United States and Western Europe.
Moreover, Russia is a large importer of edible oils, valued in 2002 at almost $600 million USD.
Much of this is soybean oil, which is sourced from the EU and South America.
As incomes rise in Russia, there may be increased demand for higher-quality oils, such as canola.
Imports of olive oil, for example, grew at more than three times the rate of all edible oils.

Market Information Europe New GM Rules in the EU Starting April 18 , 2004, new regulations regarding GMOs will apply for food and feed marketed in the EU.
These relate to the authorization of GM food and Feed, their labeling and traceability and will affect shipments of non-GM products which may contain adventitious levels of GMOs.
They are available at the following addresses:
REGULATION (EC) No 1829/2003 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL on genetically modified food and feed: http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/pri/en/oj/dat/2003/l_268/l_26820031018en00010023.pdf REGULATION (EC) No 1830/2003 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL concerning the traceability and labeling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC: http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/pri/en/oj/dat/2003/l_268/l_26820031018en00240028.pdf
Authorization The applicant for an authorization to place a product on the market applies to the authority of a member state, providing information required in Article 5 or 17 of Regulation 1829/2003.
The product goes through the approval procedure between the European Commission and Member states before being entered into the Register of GM food and feed.
The authorization is valid for 10 years and is renewable for 10-year periods, on application to the European Commission.
Regulation 1829/2003 clarifies that GMO food and feed will only have to undergo one consolidated authorization procedure under Regulation 1829/2003.
So long as the application under Regulation 1829/2003 contains specific information relating to environmental impacts of the product, a separate authorization procedure under Directive 2001/18(1) is unnecessary.
Products already placed on the market in Europe before 18 April 2004 have to be notified to the Commission by 18 October 2004, along with information required Article 5 or 17 of Regulation 1829/2003, including methods for detection, sampling and identification of the transformation event.
The products will be entered in the Register once the information package is complete and reviewed.
Labelling The following food/feed will need to be labeled in a way that will indicate that they contain GMOs: a) food/feed containing or consisting of GMOs; b) food produced from or containing ingredients produced from GMOs/ feed produced from GMOs; and, c) GMOs for feed use.
Foods/ feeds containing adventitious levels of GMOs as per the following levels will be excused from this general requirement:
• for GMOs that are approved in the EU, 0.9%;
• from April 18, 2004 to April 18, 2007, for GMOs that are not approved in the EU, but which have received a favourable opinion (favourable risk evaluation) from the Community Scientific Committee(s) and for which a detection method is available , 0.5%.
The European Commission will publish a list of GM events falling under this threshold by 18 April 2004.
These thresholds apply to each food ingredient considered individually or to food/feed consisting of a single ingredient in the food/feed.
Operators must be in a position to demonstrate that they have taken appropriate steps to avoid the presence of GMOs in order to establish that the presence of the material is adventitious or technically unavoidable.
• GMOs that have received neither EU approval nor a favourable scientific opinion are subject to a zero tolerance.
These labelling requirements do not apply to products for which the manufacturing process has commenced before April 18, 2004.
Traceability Regulation 1830/2003 provides a framework for the traceability of products consisting of or containing GMOs, and food and feed produced from GMOs.
It sets the requirement for all handlers to ensure that the following information is transmitted in writing at all stages of placing on the market: a) that it contains or consists of GMOs; b) the unique identifier(s) assigned to those GMOs as per the system established through Regulation 65/2004(2).
As for the labeling provisions, handlers shall ensure that the mention "This product contains GMOs or GM product X" appear on the label of pre-packaged products or near the display of non-pre-packaged products offered to the final consumer.
The traceability requirements do not apply to products containing adventitious levels of GMOs as per the following:
• for GMOs that are not approved in the EU, but which have received a favourable opinion (favourable risk evaluation) from the Community Scientific Committee(s) , 0.5%.

Executive Summary Spain is a leading European and world economy.
The country's economic production is dominated by its services industry, which comprises nearly two-thirds of its GDP.
Tourism is a large component of the Spanish services industry, which results in a high demand for quality food and beverages in the hotel and restaurant sector.
The income level of Spanish workers, however, is the third lowest in the European Union, which indicates a lower domestic collective buying power than most other EU states.
Income levels vary by Autonomous Community, as well as season, which suggests that certain products may be better suited to various geographic locations or seasons.
There is much diversity present within Spain, which may create niche market opportunities for Canadian exporters.
As Spain shifts away from the Mediterranean diet and more North American eating habits are adopted, opportunities for Canadian companies to supply more North American style processed products may arise.
Spain enjoys free trade within the European Union and imports most of its agriculture, agri-food and seafood products from other EU member states.
Currently, Canada only accounts for a very small portion of Spain's agriculture, agri-food and seafood import market share.
Canada has, however, been exporting an increasing amount of fish and seafood products to Spain, as domestic catches are being supplemented with imports in order to meet consumer demand.
I. Introduction to Country Market Spain has been a member of the European Union (EU) since 1986.
Spain is divided into 17 Autonomous Communities, and in turn, divided into 50 provinces, each with its own capital city.
Madrid is the largest city and the capital of Spain, with a population of 3 million (2002).
The Euro has been appreciating relative to the Canadian dollar (on an annual average) since it was introduced in 1999.
In 2002, the average annual exchange rate was $CDN 1.4832 per Euro.
Nearly all of Spain's population is at least nominally Catholic (94%).
Economic Overview Spain has the fourteenth largest GDP in the world and the fifth largest GDP in the EU.
Spain's GDP remains the fastest growing out of the large EU economies, and although GDP growth declined in 2002, it was still double the EU average.
Table 1.1:

The country has the highest unemployment rate in the EU at 11.4%, which has decreased considerably from over 20% in 1996.
Job creation continues to be the main goal of the Aznar government's economic policy, and, as a result, Spain has the highest job creation rate amongst the Euro States with 256,000 jobs being created in 2002.
Job creation continues to experience challenges, such as the taxation of labour, which acts as a disincentive, and regional housing shortages, which restrict labour mobility.
Infrastructure The Spanish Government, together with EU funding, is heavily investing in the improvement of Spain's national infrastructure.
The government has enacted the Infrastructure Master Plan, which aims to prepare Spain's infrastructure for the 21st century.
It is estimated that when the plan is fully implemented, Spain's infrastructure will be comparable to other leading European economies.
The Infrastructure Master Plan entails airport, highway, railroad and port infrastructure projects, as well as invests in the development of the telecommunications, environment and energy sectors.
Spain's infrastructure is relatively well-developed.
Ground transportation consists of 15,171 km of railway and 346,858 km of highway.
Spain's main international airports (by tonnage of merchandise traffic in 2001) are Madrid, Barcelona Vitoria, Gran Canaria and Málaga.
Most international cargo, however, is transported to Spain by water.
Spain has over 27 ports and harbours, which together imported nearly 240 billion tonnes of cargo from abroad in 2001.
This will be done by providing irrigation to the southern regions of Spain through diverting some of the river systems in the Catalan and Aragon regions.
Irrigation expansion in Spain will likely change the production capabilities of the country.
Key Chapter Conclusions
• Spain is a leading EU and world economy.
This implies that buying power is fairly high, that there is demand for value-added goods, and that economic risk is minimal.
• Spain's services-dominated economy results in a demand for high quality HRI food and beverage products due to the high level of tourism in the country.
• High unemployment in Spain may make some consumers more price-conscious.
• Access to high quality infrastructure allows for efficient transportation of goods.
• As irrigation increases, an increased amount of, and possibly a changing variety of, agricultural production will result.
This production may affect the import demand for certain agriculture and agri-food products.
Elections occur every four years; the next elections will be in March 2004.
The three parties with country-wide support are the centre-right Popular Party (PP), the centre-left Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and the Communist-led coalition, United Left (IU).
The two most prominent regional parties are the centre-right Catalan Grouping, Convergence and Union (CiU), and the centre-right Basque Nationalist Party (PNV).
Two major setbacks took place for the PP, a one-day general strike in June 2002, and the sinking of the Prestige oil tanker in November 2002.
Concern is also growing over President Aznar's unwavering support for US policy in Iraq.
It is unknown how these issues will affect Aznar's popularity and standing in the Spanish political spectrum.
The Basques The 1978 constitution granted the Basque region autonomy, but many Basques have continued to call for greater decision-making authority.
In August 2002, the courts found evidence to link the Batasuna (the political arm of the Basque separatist party) to the ETA and its terrorist actions.
The Batasuna was outlawed in March 2003, and in May 2003 over 1,000 Basque political candidates were removed from the May electoral lists.
Tens of thousands of people in Bilbao participated in a demonstration organized by Udalbitza, the peaceful successor to the Batasuna party, against the cancellation of the candidates from the electoral lists.
Spain contains 12% of the EU's population, and produces 8% of its GDP.
Spain plays a prominent role within the EU, and focuses on advancing its national interests, such as improving transportation infrastructure and water systems.
Key Chapter Conclusions:
• Spain has a democratically stable political system, which mitigates the risk of exporting.
• Some Autonomous Communities may have more political instability, and therefore more risk to exporters than others (e.g. The Basques).
• The popularity of centre-right political parties reinforces that capitalist ideas are predominant in Spain.
• Being a member of the EU allows exporters to follow the same export regulations for Spain as all other EU countries.
• Exports to Spain may be easily transhipped from destinations (e.g. ports) in other EU countries.
Country Income With an average hourly cost of labour in the industry and services sectors of €14.22/hour in 2000, the cost of labour, wages and salaries in Spain were the third lowest out of the 14 EU Member States that completed the Community Labour Costs Survey.
Refer to Figure 3.1 for a comparison of cost of labour levels among the EU member states.
Figure 3.1:
As outlined in Figure 3.2, the average hourly wage increases throughout each quarter, and then decreases significantly in the first quarter of the following year, although the average annual wage is consistently higher each year.
The average monthly salaries, however, are consistently highest in the second and fourth quarters, possibly due to an increased employment level from the influx of tourists in the Christmas and summer seasons.
Seasonality of Wages and Salaries in Spain The average monthly salary (in the industry, construction and service sectors) in the first quarter of 2003, was €1,412.52, which is an increase of 4.9% from the same period in 2002.
Figure 3.3 shows the average monthly salary in each of Spain's Autonomous Regions during the first quarter of 2003.
The region of Murcía had the lowest average monthly salary at €1139.26; whereas, Madrid had the highest monthly salary at €1736.59.
Comparison of the Average Monthly Salary per Worker in the Autonomous Regions.
The average hourly wage in Spain (for the industry, construction and services sectors) was €9.74 in the first quarter of 2003.
In addition to having the highest average monthly salary, Madrid also had the highest average hourly wage compared to the other Autonomous Regions, at €11.74 per hour.
In parallel, Murcía also had the lowest average hourly wage at €7.92 per hour.
The minimum wage in Spain was €14.74 per day (€442.20 per month) in 2002, an increase of 2% from 2001.
The inequality of income distribution in Spain is considerably higher than the EU15 average.
In 1999, the total income received by the 20% of the population with the highest income was 5.7 times more than the income received by the 20% of the population with the lowest income in Spain.
On the other hand, for the EU 15, the income received by the 20% of the population with the highest income was 4.6 times more than the income received by the 20% of the population with the lowest income.
In 1999, 18.4% of adults in Spain were considered to be living beneath the poverty line.
• Tourist seasons coincide with higher wage earning seasons.
These seasons may be a good time to market higher-value products.
• Wages are increasing in Spain; therefore, buying power is also increasing.
• Wages and, therefore, purchasing power varies by region.
Certain products may be better targeted to various regions based on their respective purchasing power.
• A large gap in income distribution exists in Spain.
This could indicate that there are markets for both premium and "value-priced" products in Spain.
Consumption/ Production The average Spanish household spent 21.9% of their total expenditures on food and non-alcoholic beverages in 2002, and another 3.2% on alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The total volume of food consumption in Spain increased 1.5% from 2000 to 2001 whereas spending increased by 8.3% over the same period (to €61.44 billion); indicating an increase in the average price of food.
Total food production in Spain was valued at €56.2 billion in 2001, an increase of 2% by value, but a decrease of almost 2% in volume.
In 2001, food consumed in the home accounted for 72.8% of food expenditures, food consumed in hotels and restaurants accounted for 25.3% of food expenditures and food consumed in institutions accounted for 1.9% of food expenditures.
Consumer Overview The traditions associated with food purchases and consumption are beginning to change within Spain.
Most Spanish consumers follow the "Mediterranean Diet", which consists of seafood, vegetables, fruits, olive oil, wine and salads.
The recent increase in the proportion of Spanish households with microwaves may also incite the consumption of more prepared and ready-to-eat foods.
In 2000, approximately 54% of households had microwaves, an increase of nearly 10% from 1999.
Nearly all Spanish households have refrigerators (99.46% in 2000).
Despite the shift away from the Mediterranean diet, Spain remains the world's second largest per capita consumer of fish and seafood products.
In 2001, total fish consumption in Spain was 1.29 million tonnes.
Due to an increase in demand and a decrease in domestic fish catches, Spain imported an increased amount of fish in 2001.
Consumer demand for fish is largely determined by price.
However, Spanish consumers are now looking for healthy alternatives to beef, due to health scares caused by cases of BSE, which may increase the demand for fish and seafood products.
Also, as the population of Spain ages, these consumers will likely increase their demand for healthier foods, including fish.
The traditional extended mid-afternoon lunch, which is the principal meal for many Spanish families, is becoming less common in large urban areas.
Breakfast is the least important meal in terms of energy in South European countries, including Spain.
It is expected that purchasing power will increase in the next few years, but the time spent shopping and preparing foods will decrease.
Due to this change in lifestyle, it is anticipated that consumption habits will also change.
In general, Spanish consumers are health conscious, concerned about food safety and value quality.
In accordance with these values, Spain's demand for organic products is increasing.
Also, as a result of the outbreak of BSE in the EU, meat consumption has decreased and vegetarian meals have experienced considerable growth in Spain.
At Home Consumption In 2001, Spanish consumers spent a total of €4.5 billion on food consumed within the home, a realized per capita annual spending of €1,105 per year (€92/month).
The majority of Spanish consumers' food expenditures consisted of meat, fish and fresh fruit in 2001.
Refer to Table 4.1 for a breakdown of per capita spending per product grouping.
Percent of At Home Food Expenditure Products:
The products with the greatest decrease in at home consumption from 2000 to 2002 were house wines (-13%), sunflower seed oil (-12%), sparkling wines (-11%), and pulses (-10%).
In parallel, over the period of 2002 to 2007, the retail value and volume of the following products, which include frozen chilled and canned ready meals, are predicted to increase by over 20% in Spain.
As demand for these food and beverage products increases, the capability of Canadian companies of supplying these products needs to be examined.
• Tea
• Canned fruit
• Canned vegetables
• Canned ready meals
• Chilled processed meats
• Chilled fish/seafood products
• Chilled/fresh pasta
• Chilled ready meals
• Frozen bakery products
• Frozen processed poultry
• Frozen processed fish/seafood products
• Frozen processed vegetables
• Frozen ready meals
• Cream
• Fromage frais and quark
• Dried ready meals
• Snack bars
• Sugar confectionery
• Gum
• Meal replacement products
• Dog and cat food
• Fruit/vegetable juice
• Bottled water
Figure 4.3 shows the variations by Autonomous Communities from the per capita national average of at home food consumption and expenditure.
The Autonomous Regions with the highest per capita consumption in 2001 were the regions of Asturias, Baleares (Balearic Islands) and Navarra.
The Autonomous Communities that consumed and spent the least on food per capita in 2001 were the regions of Extremadura, Canarias (The Canary Islands) and Castilla-La Mancha.
At Home Food Consumption and Expenditure within the Autonomous Regions.
Retail Food Sector In 2001, total grocery sales through food distribution chains and groups were valued at €44.8 billion.
Spanish consumers typically visit hypermarkets weekly or monthly to buy non-perishable products.
Table 4.2 shows this trend as the greatest proportion of fresh food products are purchased from traditional grocery outlets, and the majority of dry food products are purchased from supermarkets and hypermarkets.
Comparison of fresh and dry food product sales within various food distribution outlets Type of Grocery Outlet Fresh Products Dry Products 2000 2001 2000 2001 Hypermarkets 11.5% 11.4% 25.9% 24.8% Supermarkets 29.4% 30.3% 51.9% 53.6% Traditional 50.2% 48.8% 15.2% 14.8% Other 8.7% 9.5% 6.9% 6.8% Supermarket sales of private label brands have increased considerably in the past few years in Spain.
In 2000, private label sales for the major supermarkets totalled $6.7 billion, an increase of 18% from 1999.
Private-label brands allow retailers to generate increased profits and to differentiate themselves from competitors.
As the demand for private-label products increases, retailers are looking for new or unique products in nearly all product categories, predominantly canned vegetables.
Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional (HRI) Sector Spain's food service sector is comprised of commercial food service outlets (hotels, restaurants, pubs/bars, discos, and cafés) and social food service institutions (cafeterias in schools, penitentiaries, hospitals, the army etc.). The commercial hotel and restaurant sector in Spain accounted for €1.56 billion and social institutions accounted for €120 million in food purchases in 2001.
Combined, Spanish consumers spent 27.2% of their total food expenditures on food consumed in the HRI sector.
In 2001 there were 236,375 commercial hotel and restaurant food establishments and 25,179 institutional food establishments in Spain.
There were also over 400,000 vending machines which generated revenues of €1.8 billion; approximately 37% of vending machines sold tobacco, 35% hot beverages, 21% cold beverages and 7.5% food products such as snacks and sandwiches.
Of the 236,375 food service outlets in Spain, it is estimated that 68.5% are cafés and bars (please note that a bar in Europe is the North American equivalent of a pub), 19.7% are restaurants, 3% are hotels, and 8.8% are other establishments including new restaurant industry establishments, discos and late night music bars.
Bars and cafés accounted for 64% of total HRI food and beverage purchases in 2001, restaurants accounted for 29%, and hotels accounted for 7%.
Values and Volumes of Food and Beverage Products Consumed Outside of the Home Most alcoholic beverage sales in Spain occur in the HRI sector.
Of Spain's total alcoholic beverage sales, hotels, restaurants and caterers account for 70% of quality wine sales, 50% of sparkling wine sales, 45% of table wine sales and 70% of spirit sales.
In addition, two-thirds of beer in Spain is consumed through the HRI sector.
Spain is a substantial alcoholic beverage market for wine, spirits and beer.
Spain is the fifth largest consumer of wine in the world.
Although wine consumption has fallen over the past few decades, with annual per capita consumption now at 35.6 litres, demand for quality and special occasion wines rose to 7.9 litres per capita in 2002, and is expected to continue rising.
Spain is the largest market for whisky in the world, with whisky accounting for over half of total spirit sales, followed by white spirits (14%), brandy and cognac (10.3%) and rum (9.9%).
The beer market grew by 6% from 2001 to 2002 and is expected to continue to grow through to 2006.
An increase in health awareness amongst consumers is becoming evident in alcoholic beverage consumption, as consumers are purchasing more alcoholic beverages that provide health benefits, such as red wine and beverages with lower alcohol content.
This trend is apparent as the non-alcoholic beer market is growing in Spain, with consumption of non-alcoholic beer reaching 200 million litres in 2002.
The substantial demand for alcoholic beverages in the HRI sector can be largely attributed to Spain's sizeable tourism industry.
The HRI sector and tourism industry in Spain may present opportunities for Canadian exporters for niche alcoholic beverages such as quality and specialty wines (including ice wine), low-alcohol and non-alcoholic beer, whisky and flavoured rum drinks.
Tourism is a key component of Spain's HRI sector attracting approximately 50 million visitors annually.
The influx of tourists to Spain during the summer months and Christmas season significantly increases the demand for high-value and consumer ready products from the HRI food sector.
The large number of tourists within Spain, along with the fact that Spanish consumers are travelling more to other countries, is also increasing the demand for new products and increasing the appeal for ethnic foods and restaurants.
Ethnic restaurants have been experiencing substantial growth in the past few years, with restaurants offering Tex-Mex or American-style products experiencing the greatest amount of growth.
Cafés are also experiencing considerable growth (19% in 2001), with approximately 45% of the coffee in Spain being consumed in the HRI sector.
Growth in the fast-food sector, however, has declined substantially since 1998.
Production Primary Crops Spain's major primary crops produced in 2002 were barley (8.3 million tons), sugar beets (7.9 million tons), wheat (6.8 million tons), grapes (5.6 million tons), maize (4.4 million tons), olives (4.3 million tons), tomatoes (3.9 million tons), potatoes (3.1 million tons), and oranges (2.9 million tons).
Fish and Seafood Catches Since Spain's inception into the EU in 1986, Spanish fisheries have been faced with fishing quotas, which have decreased domestic fishing stocks.
Spain's catch quota for 2002 decreased 17% from 2001.
Spain's domestic fish and seafood catches consist of blue fish, hake and whiting, cod, tuna, squid, octopus and mussels.
In November 2002, a vessel carrying over 20 million gallons of fuel oil sank about 150 miles from Spain's Atlantic coast, crippling the fishing industry in Galacia.
The spill is anticipated to reach Spain's southern waters, where the world's largest mussel beds are found.
This disaster is expected to have a significant impact on Spain's domestic fish and seafood supply for a number of years.
Food Processing Sector The food processing industry in Spain is the fifth largest in the EU.
Spain's food processing sector comprises 5.5% of Spain's GDP, produces approximately 20% of Spain's total industrial output, and employs 17% of the total work force.
There were approximately 36,970 food and beverage processing plants in Spain in 2001, which generated product valued at €56.2 billion.
The total processed food production in 2001 increased in value by 2% from 2000, but decreased in volume by almost 2%; thus indicating an increase in the average price per product.
Spain produced over 5 million tonnes of meat in 2001, and has an estimated production capacity of 7 million tonnes/year.
In 2001, Spain processed approximately 3 million tonnes of pork, 1 million tonnes of poultry, 642,000 tonnes of beef and veal and 254,000 tonnes of mutton and goat meat.
Average meat consumption in Spain was 66 kg per capita in 2001.
Dairy Products The highest concentration of milk production in Spain occurs in Asturias, which accounts for 54% of national milk sales.
Per capita consumption of liquid milk in Spain is estimated to be 113 litres, of which 86% is consumed in the home.
In 2002, Spain produced 178,910 tonnes of cheese.
It is estimated that Spain has a per capita consumption of 6 kg of cheese.
Fats and Oils Total olive oil production in Spain was 829,500 tonnes in 2002, making Spain the world's top producer of olive oil.
Per capita consumption of fats and oils in Spain is approximately 21 litres, of which 56% is olive oil, 39% is sunflower oil and 5% is oil from other oilseeds.
The majority of olive oil consumption occurs within the home (83.4%).
Total Spanish consumption of canned fruits and vegetables is estimated to be 800,000 tonnes per year.
Canned Seafood Spain produces 250,000 tonnes of canned seafood annually.
There are 133 processing plants in Spain, of which approximately 80% are located in Galicia.
The majority (55%) of total canned seafood produced is tuna.
Sardines, octopus, squid, mackerel and mussels are also canned.
Alcoholic Beverages Spain is a strong producer of wine and beer.
Spain is the world's third largest producer of wine, producing over 3.4 million tonnes in 2002.
The wine sector accounts for 11.3% of Spain's food processing industry's output, with over 3,800 companies involved in the wine business.
In 2002, beer production totaled 2.5 million tonnes, but Spain still remains a net importer of beer.
Spain is the third largest beer producer in the EU, and the ninth largest in the world, also producing most of its own inputs for beer, such as hops (1,200 tonnes in 2002).
Average per capita consumption of beer was 75 litres in 2001, and 3.1 billion litres in total.
Per capita consumption of bottled water was 103 litres, with 74.3% being consumed in the home.
Spain produced 200 million litres of non-alcoholic beer in 2001, an increase of 9% from 2000.
Consumption of non-alcoholic beer was 5 litres per capita in 2001, the highest consumption rate in the EU.
In 2001, production of soft drinks totaled 3.89 billion litres in Spain, the third most in the EU.
Production of juices in Spain totaled 957.8 million litres in 2000, an increase of 4.7% since 1999.
Consumption of juices and nectars totaled 700 million litres, with about 74% being consumed within the home.
Trade Policy and Standards As a member of the European Union, Spain has no independent bilateral trade agreements with any developed nation,although the free trade agreements negotiated by the EU apply to Spain.
The EU has free trade agreements that include agricultural trade with Mexico, South Africa, and the Mediterranean countries.
The European Economic Area (EEA), which consists of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, also shares a free trade agreement with the EU.
The EU gives preferential Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade treatment to nine members of the WTO (Australia, Canada, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, China, Japan, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Singapore and the United States).
Under the Generalized System of Preferences the EU also grants preferential tariffs to more than 100 developing countries and about 40 overseas territories.
In addition to being a member of the European Union, Spain is also a member of the: 2003-2004 UN Security Council, Economic and Monetary Union, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, World Bank, United Nations Conference of Trade and Development, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, African Development Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank.
Spain has followed the GATT code since 1963, and adheres to the 1969 Multilateral Trade Negotiations codes on technical barriers to trade subsidies and customs valuations.
As a member of the EU, Spain also adheres to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
The CAP is a joint policy of the European Union that allows for free movement of goods and capital within the EU member states, and also sets common tariffs on imported goods coming from non-EU countries.
Each EU member state applies the same Common Customs Tariff (CCT), although the rate differs by origin and type of import.
VAT's are levied in the country of final destination, which is 7% for agricultural products in Spain.
There are, however, a few agricultural commodities that are either duty-free or subject to minimal duties (e.g. soybeans, sunflower seed, and corn by-product).
Trade Restrictions Spain and the rest of the EU Member States prohibit the importation of farm or aquaculture animals or food products to which hormonal substances have been administered, as stated in the provisions of Council Directive 96/22/EC.
Under this regulation, Canada may only export non-hormone treated animal products to the EU.
The allegations are that the EU is maintaining a de-facto moratorium on new GM varieties, given that since October 1998, no new GMOs have been authorized.
Testing, Labelling and Certification The requirements on labelling, marking and testing in Spain are complex and change frequently.
The Directorate General of Health sets the standards for food preparation, residual content and storage media for almost all classes of foodstuffs intended for human consumption.
Labels must be in Spanish, and include the product designation, list of ingredients, weight or volume, dates (manufacturing, packing, minimum shelf life and expiration), directions on food preservation (if applicable), identification of the firm involved (manufacturer, packer or importer), and country of origin.
A sticker written in Spanish with all the mandatory labelling information is also acceptable in lieu of a label.
Milk products, margarine, chocolate and soaps have additional technical labelling requirements.
Nutritional labelling is not mandatory unless a nutritional claim is being made in the labelling, presentation or advertising of the product.
All exports to Spain are required to possess a commercial invoice, export declaration form, bill of lading packing list and three copies of a certificate of origin.
Import licenses, which are also required, are issued by the registrar general of the Secretariat of Trade in Spain and are valid for six months.
The request for an import licence must be accompanied by an invoice listing transportation and insurance fees, the CIF price, the net and gross weights and the invoice number.
Phytosanitary certificates are required for most fresh fruit, vegetable, and plant material entering Spain.
Official government export documents are required with the shipments of commodities containing animal products or by-products, and commodities that have been subjected to heat treatment or radiation.
An import certificate (AGRIM) is required for various agricultural products.
• Spanish consumers are spending more on food than their respective wages are increasing.
(Spanish consumers spent more on food by about 2.5 times more than their wages increased in 2000.)
• Spanish consumers increased their spending on food and beverage products by more than they increased their consumption.
Consumers are also frequenting ethnic restaurants more.
Opportunities may arise in supplying ethnic food products, primarily American and Tex-Mex.
Opportunities for exporters to supply traditionally domestic catches in the Spanish market may result.
• Breakfast is the least important meal for Spanish consumers; however, the likelihood of skipping breakfast is lower than in North America.
• Convenience and health concerns are becoming increasingly important considerations for Spanish consumers and there is a growing demand for products that address these concerns.
• As shopping patterns shift, exporters should be aware of the sector (i.e. HRI vs. Retail vs. Food Processing) and establishment (e.g. café vs. restaurant; supermarket vs. traditional outlet) best suited for their product(s).
• It may be beneficial for exporters to target specific regions of Spain, as food expenditure and consumption varies throughout Spain's Autonomous Communities.
• Exporters interested in the Spanish alcoholic beverages market may wish to target niche markets in the HRI sector.
• Spain has a highly developed food processing sector, and produces many agriculture, agri-food and seafood products domestically.
Domestic production is a key competitor to imported products.
• Canada has Most Favoured Nation status with Spain (and the EU as a whole), with an average agricultural tariff rate of 16.1%.
This status gives Canada a relative advantage over some countries with regards to tariff rates, although European Union member states enjoy free trade privileges with Spain.
V. Overview of Imports/Exports of Agri-Food Products/ Agri-Food Markets Worldwide Trade with Spain Spain is a net exporter of agriculture, agri-food and seafood products.
In 2000, Spain exported €17.98 billion in agriculture, agri-food and seafood products worldwide, and imported €17.69 billion.
Spain's main trading partners are other EU countries.
Nearly 78% of Spain's agriculture, agri-food and seafood exports went to other EU member states in 2000.
The majority of Spain's agriculture, agri-food and seafood imports (54.6%) also came from other EU member states.
Processed food and beverage products account for over half of Spain's edible agriculture, agri-food and seafood imports, with over two-thirds originating from the EU.
However, 60.3% of Spain's primary agriculture and seafood imports originate from non-EU countries.
It is important to note that trade statistics for EU countries are likely skewed due to re-exportation of goods throughout the European free trade zone.
Canada - Spain Bilateral Trade Trade Balance In 2002, Canada's agriculture, agri-food and seafood exports to Spain were valued at $86.5 million, which accounted for approximately 0.4% of Spain's total agriculture, agri-food and seafood imports.
Conversely, Canada's agriculture, agri-food and seafood imports from Spain were valued at $170.7 million.
Canada's agri-food balance of trade with Spain changed from a trade surplus to a trade deficit from 2001 to 2002, with a decrease of over 400%.
Overview of Canada-Spain Bilateral Agri-Food Trade Canada-Spain Agri-Food Trade ($ million CDN) 2001 2002 Total Agri-Food Exports: 169.495 76.507 Total Agri-Food Imports: 143.990 161.75 Balance of Agri-Food Trade: 25.505 (86.668) Total Fish and Seafood Exports:* 4.870 9.983 Total Fish and Seafood Imports: 3.774 9.573 Balance of Fish and Seafood Trade: 1.096 0.410 Total Balance of Trade: 26.601 (86.258) * Note:
There is a large discrepancy between Spain's statistics of fish and seafood imports from Canada ($36 million in 2002) and Canada's exports of fish and seafood products to Spain ($9.983 million in 2002).
This discrepancy is likely due to the re-exportation of fish and seafood through other EU member countries.
Spain's "actual" imports from Canada are likely somewhere between the two statistics.
Canada's Agriculture, Agri-Food and Seafood Exports to Spain Canada's agriculture, agri-food, and seafood exports to Spain decreased dramatically between 2001 and 2002, although exports were relatively stable from 1999 to 2001.
Canada's top agri-food exports to Spain in 2002 consisted mainly of pulse crops, with soybeans being Canada's top export to Spain in 2002.
The decline of Canada's exports to Spain in 2002 occurred mainly in the commodity of dried and shelled peas (other than green, yellow, split or sowing peas) which decreased from a value of $82.8 million in 2001, to $20,000 in 2002.
This decrease in pea exports does not seem like a one-year obscurity as Canadian exports of these peas have remained significantly lower than 2001 levels with a value of about $2.7 million through October 2003.
Because Spain imported fewer peas from all countries in 2002 by over 350 tonnes (valued at ~US$40 million) and domestic pea production only increased by approximately 42 tonnes in 2002, it can be inferred that either Spain's consumption of peas decreased substantially in 2002, or Spain's re-exportation of peas decreased substantially in 2002.
A decrease in pea consumption may coincide with the trend of moving away from the traditional Mediterranean diet.
Canada's intermediate exports to Spain, which dominated Canada's agri-food exports to Spain from 1996 to 2001, have decreased annually since 2000.
Canada has been increasing exports of the following agriculture, agri-food and seafood products to Spain over the period of 2000 to 2002 (only products with exports valued at over $200,000 in 2002 were included - for more detail, see Appendix 1):
• Frozen bovine edible offal
• Live lobsters
• Chickpeas dried and shelled
• Green lentils dried and shelled
• Soya beans
• Rye whisky
• Dog or cat food
2002 Percent of Total Total Agri-Food Imports 161.175 100.00% Grape Wines - less than 2 L. 24.397 15.14% Mandarins 22.227 13.79% Olives 13.308 8.26% Capsicum and Pimenta Peppers 12.327 7.65% Tomatoes - Fresh or Chilled 9.662 6.00%

• Spain's main agriculture, agri-food and seafood trading partners are other EU member countries, especially in processed food and beverages.
It is very difficult for Canada to compete with these countries due to their free-trade status with Spain.
• Canada currently has a very small share of Spain's agriculture, agri-food and seafood import market.
• Canada's exports to Spain decreased significantly in 2002; however, Canada's seafood exports to Spain have increased significantly from 2000 to 2002, and opportunities in the seafood sector are expected to continue.
Market Structure The Spanish market is decentralized, with Madrid and Barcelona acting as hubs for Spain's regional markets.
Madrid connects the southern, western and central regions of Spain, while Barcelona connects the Balearic Islands and the North African cities of Ceuta and Melilla.
The majority of agents, distributors, foreign subsidiaries and government-controlled entities operate out of Madrid and Barcelona.
Foreign firms usually choose to appoint an agent or distributor, or to establish a subsidiary in either, or both, of these two cities in order to access regional markets, as this local representation is usually more familiar with the various cultures, consumption attitudes, and preferences within the different regions of Spain.
Important centres for the agriculture, agri-food and seafood sectors include:
• Madrid - Spain's main centre for banking, administration and transportation, and home to the headquarters of many large international firms;
• Barcelona and Bilbao - two of Spain's leading ports;
• Valencia - a major centre for citrus fruits and vegetables;
• Seville - a major source of olive oil, cork, wines and other agricultural products; and
• Vigo - Spain's most important fishing and fish-canning centre.
Marketing food and beverage products directly to retail outlets is not a common practice in Spain.
In 2000, the two main food distribution companies in Spain were IFA Española, with sales of €10.2 billion, and Euromadi Iberica, with sales of €9.6 billion.
Both companies are importers/distributors.
Although the use of distributors is common in the food and beverage sector, most fresh products (e.g. seafood, fruits and vegetables) are distributed through 22 public wholesale markets located throughout Spain.
Many large grocery retail chains use buyers to purchase fresh products for their retail outlets from these wholesalers.
These products are then delivered to the retailer's platform or warehouses, where they are then distributed to each retail store.
Grocery Retailers There are five types of grocery retail outlets in Spain:
There are approximately 2,958 discount stores in Spain.
The leader in the market is Dia, which is owned by Carrefour.
They carry a wide variety of food and non-food items, and are usually located outside of town centers.
There were 13,175 supermarkets in Spain in 2001.
A convenience store is an outlet that has a maximum area of 500 sq. meters, is open to the public every day for 18 hours, and offers a wide variety of products including food, books, newspapers, presents and toys.
Convenience stores are usually located in the centres of small and medium sized towns, and are often co-located with gas stations.
There are about 5,600 convenience stores in Spain.
The grocery retail sector is becoming more concentrated as the number of traditional retail outlets is diminishing, while the number of supermarkets, discount markets and hypermarkets is growing.
(Refer to Figure 6.1).
Growth trends of Retail Outlets in Spain (1999-2001) Hotels, Restaurants, and Institutions (HRI) Commercial distributors in the HRI sector are capable of supplying the majority of the needs of Spain's diverse food service providers.
In 2000, nearly two-thirds of food and beverages purchased by food service providers were bought through distributors.
Food service companies also purchase their products through wholesalers, manufacturers, traditional retail outlets, cash and carries, supermarkets, hypermarkets, cooperatives and other methods.
Many smaller distribution companies are merging into larger companies, such as Grupo Nacional de Distribution (GRUNADIS) and the Spanish Association of Distributors (AEDIS).
GRUNADIS supplies food service retailers throughout Spain; whereas, AEDIS has member organizations in each of Spain's provinces and centrally purchases imports for distribution to its provincial organizations.
Many distribution companies have outlets specifically tailored for supplying the HRI sector.
For example, Makro, Unigro, Coop.
Coviran, H.D. Covalco, Puntocash, Alimentacion Peninsular, and Grup Enaco all have outlets for supplying the HRI sector.
Some distribution companies, such as Mercatel and Davingel (Balearic Islands), and Grup Sehrs (Costa Brava), have located in high tourism areas in Spain in order to better serve the HRI sector.
The variation in HRI outlets is partially attributed to the high level of tourism present in certain regions of the country, such as the Mediterranean coast, Balearic Islands and Canary Islands.
Table 6.1 shows the distribution of foodservice outlets by region in Spain.
The northeastern region of Spain (Aragón, Cataluña and Balearic Islands), a popular tourist destination, has the highest proportion of foodservice outlets in the country (2001).

Food Processing Food processing companies usually import or directly purchase their ingredients from producers.
Processed food products are sold to the public mainly through retail outlets.
Most retail processed food sales occur through supermarkets (58.5%), followed by hypermarkets (28.2%) and traditional retail outlets (13.3%).
Many products are also sold through the HRI sector.
Numerous Spanish food processing companies are involved in joint ventures with foreign food companies, with 25-30% of total food sales in Spain occurring through completely or partially owned foreign companies.
In the Spanish beverage sector, foreign firms account for 45% of total sales.
The main food processing companies operating in Spain, in 2000, were Servicios de Bebidas Refrescantes (Coca Cola), Azucarer Ebro Agricolas (processed foods) and Nestle España (processed foods).
Refer to Appendix 2 for a more detailed list of the leading food processing companies in Spain.
This makes it exceedingly difficult for Canadian firms to compete with EU firms with respect to price.
Spain's agriculture, seafood and food processing sectors are highly developed, making domestic production a strong competitor with Canada's exports.
The majority of inputs used in Spain's food processing industry are either produced domestically or are imported from other EU member states.
The United States is in competition with Canada on many agricultural products, given that both countries' agricultural industries produce many of the same products, and face the same tariff rates.
The transition away from the Mediterranean diet to a more North American diet in Spain is likely to increase the competition between the United States and Canada in supplying North-American products to Spain.
Canadian exporters may wish to send their products to these cities as a primary destination.
• Exporters may find it beneficial to hire a local agent to access regional markets due to the diversity present in the various regions of Spain.
• Spain's food distribution system is well-developed and becoming increasingly concentrated and specialized.
The use of distributors is most common in the food and beverage retail and HRI sectors.
• Fresh products (including seafood) are typically distributed through public wholesale markets.
• Many Spanish food processing companies are involved with joint ventures with foreign food companies.
Canadian companies wishing to supply the food processing sector in Spain may also want to consider joint venture opportunities.
• Imports from European Union member countries and the US, as well as domestic Spanish production are Canada's main competitors in the Spanish market.
Identification of Contestable Markets for Canadian Agri-Food Exports in Spain Contestable Markets and Possible Opportunities Several potential opportunities have been identified for Canadian companies to export agriculture, agri-food and seafood products to Spain.
Refer to Table 7.1.
These opportunities are based on the consumption and export trends identified throughout the document.
Some products that were identified as consumption trends in Spain were excluded as opportunities for Canadian companies based on the examination of Canada's capabilities in these areas and previous export performance to Spain and the EU.

But, this all failed.
The Regional Director gave up."
Agencies agree.
Agency Support from Operators:
A concern is:
WBNP/ Nahanni NP says:
The days when park wardens were game wardens?
Lack of Practical Definition:
Tours of Exploration:
Clarify the Practical Implications of Ecological Integrity Challenge:
Kananskis Country says:
Concerns about Extremes in Implementation:
Illegal or Inappropriate Activities Continue:
Their points include:
Operators say unguided visitors need controls.
Company Goals
Many operators provide such interpretive opportunities.
Discuss Parks Mandate Great Divide:
Great Divide staff have:
• We follow ecotourism guidelines.
FreshAir Adventures practices conservation on all their trips.
We do not rent accommodation to people arriving with jet-skis.
Tours of Exploration keeps a minimum group size.
Strider Adventures has maximum groups of 10 people.
Québec Hors-Circuit also uses small groups.
We pack out what we pack in."
Kananaskis Country commends Inside Out Experience Adventure Tours.
Environmental Stewardship & Messaging:
Prince Albert NP commends CanoeSki Discovery.
Visitor Conduct Guidance:
Clients comply."
Submit Sightings and Information Reports and Research:
Leave No Trace (LNT) Practices:
BC Parks would like to see operators:
Best Practices in Natural Heritage Collaborations:
Manitoba Parks:
Greater use of parks interpretive staff."
Provide use of edu-kits for private trips.
Best Practices in Natural Heritage Collaborations:
Our programs help to fill some of the gap."
Butterfly Tours offers local courses for kayaking.
Maintenance:
Jamie’s Whaling Station, BC:
Research:
This program relates to both park and non-park lands.
Marketing Parks Role Challenge:
Great Divide:
But other agencies do this".
Marketing Collaborations Challenge:
They cover all related costs.
Some marketing activities include:
• Selling Permits:
Distribute Parks Brochures:
Park Admission Sales:
Film Materials:
• Distribute Operator Brochures:
Referrals:
Best Practices in Natural Heritage Collaborations:
Cooperative Promotions:
This helps maintain the integrity of the product."
It would appear to indicate that demand is increasing."
Such illegal activity makes legitimate operators really frustrated.
Algonquin Outfitters:
Kanata Adventures:
Great Divide:
Gros Morne NP:
All commercial users must be forced to comply."
Monitoring Standards, Guidelines and Activities Challenge:
Unfortunately, these guidelines are not being adhered to.
Opportunities Challenge:
They also feel school groups have potential.
Operators are willing to collaborate:
Parks could take various initiatives:
Suggested Future Actions Challenge:
Operators are interested in improving through feedback.
Let’s hope that improves.

It is reproduced below.
Phase II Final report on June 30, 2004
The study was undertaken by two consultants:
This conference was held in Ottawa in June, 1991.
Its research relies heavily on economic modelling techniques.
The References section contains the titles of related publications.
CTSA definition is similar to that of TSA-RMF.
It has two dimensions:
Reconciling these concepts leads to issues that are discussed below.
. CTSA makes no imputation for second homes.
They are not published as part of CTSA:
Study of the Canadian Tourism Satellite Account (CTSA)
No consumption good or service is excluded by its nature.
Fares on non-resident airlines are excluded.
This issue requires special study.
This issue is under review.
C. Tourism collective consumption.
D. Tourism gross fixed capital formation.
Should time-shares in vacation property also be included?
TSA-RMF then describes the series of transformations required.
In general, Canada’s practice corresponds to the recommended process.
An overview of these implications is therefore provided below.
CTSA defines 7 categories of Tourism commodities.
Currently CTSA does not measure post trip expenditures.
TSA-RMF TOURISM CHARACTERISTIC PRODUCTS
CTSA-TOURISM COMMODITIES
Accommodation services 1.1 Hotels and other lodging services
Food- and beverage-serving services
Activities TSA-RMF defines 12 categories of Tourism characteristic activities (TCA).

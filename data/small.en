Astronomes The next generation of Canadian astronomers.
In the future :
The Rothney Astrophysical Observatory An example of a successful partnership
They are: 1.
Kingston Observatory in London, Ontario: est.
In 1962, a second radio telescope was put in place.
The year of 1981 was particularly fruitful for the observatory.
Observation time is distributed in these same proportions.
Ultraviolet light is also particularly difficult to collect.
The observatory is also used for other research projects.
Video sequence   John Barrie Hutchings explains what FUSE is.
Stars produce large amounts of neutrinos.
Work began in 1990 and was completed in 1999.
The frequency of neutrino detection is one per hour.
All together the satellite weighs 250 kilograms.
Video sequence  Jaymie Mark Matthews explains what MOST is.
The entire observatory will weigh 6,600 kilograms.
Jack Newton Known for his world famous photographs
The next generation
King published many scientific articles on astronomy.
Chant acted as President from 1904 to 1907.
Asteroid 3316 was named in his honour.
Asteroid 2917 was named in her honour.
Asteroid 4230 bears his name in his honour.
Video sequence   Hubert Reeves explains what science is.
Racine specializes in the study of globular clusters.
Hutchings has published more than 400 scientific articles to date.
Other instruments were to follow.
Video sequence   Peter Gordon Martin talks about interstellar dust.
Asteroid 4230 is named in his honour.
Video sequence   Gilles Fontaine explains what asteroseismology is.
It was quite a triumph.
In addition to asteroseismology, Matthews has other interests.
The year 1997 was a particularly significant year for Matthews.
In 1973, Newton’s work required him to move to Toronto.
A Photographic Guide for the Amateur in 1977.
He wrote two books with Philip Teece:
It is a rare and spectacular event.
Asteroid 3673 is named after him.
Video sequence   Stéphanie Coté talks about women in astronomy.
Astronomers Instruments The human eye An extraordinary organ
The first instruments The transit and the sextant
Reflecting telescopes Concentrating light using mirrors
Invisible light collectors Seeing the invisible
Photographic plates Memorizing light
Photometers Measuring the brightness of celestial objects
Infrared cameras Photographing the invisible using infrared light
Spectrometers Pulling light apart to extract information
The cornea surrounds and protects the eye.
Immediately behind the iris is the lens.
Many different astronomical instruments have been used throughout the ages.
His book revolutionized our concept of the Universe.
Spherical aberration causes images to be blurred.
Video sequence   Peter Gordon Martin explains what aberration is.
Video sequence   Jaymie Mark Matthews explains what a reflector is.
It consists of two mirrors: the primary and the secondary.
Video sequence   John Barrie Hutchings explains what a refractor is.
Microwaves are of immense interest to astronomers.
The result is a photographic image.
A photometer has several applications in astronomy.
Let’s take a look at the case of temperature.
It was the first true photometer.
In all, 2,363 infrared sources were detected.
There are two types of spectrometers: spectroscopes and spectrographs.
The first spectrographs used a photographic camera as a detector.
It was the first photograph of our Sun’s spectrum.
Among other things, he discovered that lunar light is polarized.
The answer was not long in coming, however.
This is destructive interference.
The first tests were performed in 1983 and 1984.
Video sequence   René Racine talks about adaptive optics.
What would we do without it?
So what exactly is light?
Light is a form of energy produced by matter.
Video sequence   Hubert Reeves talks about light.
In 1662, Newton began his own optical experiments.
The main picture represents the electromagnetic spectrum.
Text of this activity
Gamma rays The most energetic form of light.
Radioactive chemical elements produce gamma rays.
The sun under Gamma rays
The sun under X-rays
The sun under Ultraviolet
Visible Light that can be perceived by the human eye.
The sun Visible
The sun under Infrared
Microwave (1 mm–1 cm) Relatively non-energetic invisible light.
It is used for a wide variety of technological applications.
Radio (1 cm +) Relatively non-energetic invisible light.
The sun under Radio waves
Emission spectra of hydrogen.
Emission spectra of iron.
However, he quickly changed his mind and abandoned the hypothesis.
Video sequence  Gilles Fontaine explains what a light-year is.
Boy What is a light year?
Girl It’s like travelling through time.
Now I understand!
Wildlife and plants are also affected.
In astronomy, light pollution is a real and pressing problem.
The plans typically revolve around three lines of action.
Your turn to get involved!
Then choose to light what is really necessary.

The story has repeated itself every year since then.
The young man replied, "I am Morning Star.
He flew her up to the sky, into Sky Country.
If you do, it will bring misfortune."
This one is from the Iroquois of Ontario.
"Don’t be stupid," another replied.
"Rocks can be broken."
"What about trees?
"Why not take on the form of Night?
Night is never destroyed!" exclaimed one of the brothers.
"They live in the sky and never die."
This, however, does not appear to have been the case.
Finally, the intense nighttime cold makes observation physically difficult.
It occupied the centre of their universe.
Four men were hunting a bear.
It was during this time that magic words were created.
A powerful angakoq (shaman) decided to visit the Moon.
The Moon-Man heard him and descended to Earth.
It evolved over time, and thus it has a history.
Astronomers Equipment and preparation How does a star finder work?
Astronomy can be practiced during the day or night.
It is dangerous to view the Sun directly.
Bring a notebook and pencil to take notes.
Look for well-known brands that have established and reliable reputations.
How does a star finder work?
The way a star finder works is simple.
Instructions The activity simulates a real star search.

And it’s not just disappearing stars that are the problem.
Amerindian  Your parents are right.
Girl  Who are you?
Mother  Where did you come from?
Amerindian  I’m from around here and my name is Magella.
Light pollution closes that window.
Amerindian  Light pollution upsets many types of animals.
Even people are affected.
Life on Earth needs the night.
Amerindian  Would you like a marshmallow?
Girl  Stop talking nonsense!
Beautiful place, isn’t it?
Technician  It sure is.
A telescope is a very powerful piece of equipment!
Girl  True!
Technician  Yup!
Technician  You’re absolutely right.
Telescopes have changed our view of the world.
Looking through a telescope is like magic.
It shows us the Universe!
Girl  Neat!
Technician  Absolutely!
Technician  Come with me… I want to show you something.
Boy  Where are we going?
Boy and Girl  Wow!
Father  Certainly. But everyone must make an effort.
This is my best vacation ever!
Technician  Play the interactive game to reduce light pollution.
Narration  Imagine!
WOW!
Girl  Hey, it’s pretty cold here!
Technician  And the telescope room is never heated.
Even in the winter!
But the control room is warm!
Boy  Wow!
That’s Saturn!
Father  It’s hard to imagine, isn’t it?
They date back to when the Universe was very young.
Technician  Yes, that’s true.
Mother  But we’re leaving today.
Boy and Girl  Oh no!
We want to stay for the astronomy festival!
Boy and Girl  Yay!
Thanks, Dad!

TABLE OF CONTENTS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY REGIONAL OVERVIEW IMPORTATION DISTRIBUTION:
China is in a period of transition.
MAP OF THE YANGZI DELTA REGION1 Anhui:
In 1990, Shanghai opened its first supermarket.
• Fish and seafood;
• Processed meat;
• Dairy products;
• Wine and beverages;
• Confectionery;
• Nutraceutical foods.
Nevertheless, there are still significant challenges and barriers.
AQSIQ will also ensure the label is correct.
Also, these companies have access to foreign capital.
The import licence system will be abolished completely in 2006.
13% Tomatoes, fresh or chilled 13% 0%
17% Maple sugar & syrup 33% 32% 31% 30%
17% Meat Products Beef (frozen cuts) 31.8% 25.2% 18.6% 12.0%
13%-17% Poultry (frozen) 16% 14% 12% 10%

Shanghai applications can be submitted to the SHCIQ.
• Name of the food
• Ingredient Table
• Net contents on the packaged (volume or weight)
• Name and Address of the importer and manufacturer
• Production and Expiry date
• Storage directions
• Country of Origin
The stickers cannot be detached from the product.
Points to Remember:
Their processes continue to be non-transparent and inflexible.
DISTRIBUTION:
A GLANCE Today, the distribution system has evolved drastically.
It is also the most crucial.
The following graph represents the traditional distribution structure.
The following graph represents the modern distribution system.
Significant layers and regulations have been removed.
• State Owned Distributors
• Foreign Based Distributors
They seldom import small quantities of goods.
Advantages
• Possession of needed import licenses
• Strong purchasing power and access to foreign capital
• Connection to government parties Disadvantages
• Specializes in large import orders
• High commissions
• Competitive Prices
• Geographic scope
• Poor handling and distribution.
Tips for dealing with your distributor
Ltd., Inchcape PLC, EAC and JDH (Li & Fung).
Profile of Selected Foreign Distributors in China:
Sales and Distribution Logistics SIMS Trading
• 30 city branches
• Employs more than 320 staff
• Distribution network of 60 cities
• Serving 10 Principles (Kraft)
• Multiple JV with local wholesalers
• JV with Nestle Jebson & Co.
• Head office in Hong Kong
• Warehousing
Taxes are based on expenses incurred.
  Joint Venture establishments are another option to establish a presence.
Taxes are based on profit.
Registered capital can be used as working capital.
• Maximum level of control over the product
• Establish relationships with local contacts
• Legal entity status Disadvantages
Is the distributor physically strong (man power, infrastructure, expertise)?
Does the distributor have an established distribution network?
What is their current product portfolio?
Are there similar products to yours?
Points to Remember:
Difficulties stem from a variety of problems:
• Legal constraints and regulations
• Accounts receivable
• Fragmented distribution system (wholesaler, distributor, retailers)
• Intellectual Property Rights
• Out-dated or ill-equipped transportation system
• Establishing Relationships
The problem occurs for both foreign and domestic enterprises.
Performing credit assessments can be a daunting task.
Each layer ultimately adds to the price of the item.
The problem applies equally to Chinese based companies.
Adequate warehouse space continues to be a problem.
China continues to be a haven for counterfeit goods.
Food products are no exception.
Patents are registered at a separate office.
Points to Remember
Money is commonly transferred using a telegraphic transfer (TT).
The infrastructure system is archaic, undeveloped, and over-burdened with users.
Infrastructure will continue to improve.
The three exceptions include Maersk, APL and P&O Nedlloyd.
The right match will make the difference in the market.
It is also the most expensive.
In 2010, it will handle 20 million containers.
The average Chinese trucking firm owns one truck.
There is no one national trucking company.
Special licenses may apply.
It remains the cheapest form.
The railway networks covers a large geographic territory.
The rail system continues to be overburdened with use.
Transport delays are common.
The current length is 71 000 kms of line.
A key drawback to rail transportation is handling.
Handlers are notorious for mishandling goods.
• Fast
• Reliable
• Minimised Damage
• Flexible schedules
• Negotiable rates
• Better control over merchandise Disadvantage Disadvantage
• Expensive
• Limits on load size
• Corruption, highway tolls
• Decentralised
• Good for bulk goods, as commodities
• Relatively cheap
• Covers a large geographic territorry
• No capacity problems
• Slow
• Bureaucratic
• High Damage Rage
• Coal and grain have priority
• Need to book space in advance
• Not flexible
• Ill equipped for inland transport
Today, there are over 50 hypermarkets operating in Shanghai.
The largest foreign presence is French based Carrefour.
In 1991, the first supermarket opened its doors.
The largest supermarket operators are Chinese-owned companies.
The top leading companies in Shanghai are Lianhua and Hualian.
Store Name # of Stores
The Chain store approach facilitates and co-ordinates distribution.
By 2005, the estimated number is 5000.
7-11 owns 30% of the Lawson stores.
Imported products rarely adorn the shelves.
Few independent stores exist in the market.
In reality, it is a series of local, regional markets.
Trends vary from one city to another.
Cities to watch are Shanghai, Beijing and Guanzhou.
An important element of promotion is education.
Certain products require significant education.
Product Size Import/Made in China Average Price
Food festivals are also popular.
Products requiring cold storage facilities may encounter problems.
The store will not provide any additional services.
The customer will not be able to miss the product.

An average Ukrainian Supermarket is:
• 200-700 square metres in warehouse area,
• US$ 10-15 single purchase,
• 1,500-2,500 buyers per day,
• 10,000-15,000 number of items on sale,
• 50-200 number of staff per store,
Smaller dealers often work by catalogues.
Retailers became more interested in multi functional, complex automation software.

We can go ashore.
Hurry!"
Miguel was not as intimidated.
Tyee led them deeper into the rainforest.
The small group plodded along at a steady march.
Miguel and Simon stood dead still.
Tyee was cautious but confident.
The mother tore away at the naked grasses.
Her head bobbed from side to side.
Her silt covered nostrils flared and dilated constantly.
Her ears flickered like miniature antennae.
The tranquil scene shifted ominously.
Something imperceptible to Simon and Miguel alerted the mother bear.
The giant grizzly rolled onto her massive haunches.
She sat there cautiously but quietly.
Her forearms extended from massive shoulders.
The meadow was flush with tall flowers.
They continued upstream.
Soon, the trees began to thin.
Miguel could see a meadow ahead of them.
"Amazing," Simon said quietly.
Simon and Miguel watched as the moose leisurely chewed branches.
Suddenly, the huge animal just disappeared.
The seafarers blinked in disbelief.
They heard a rustling sound in the foliage.
The noise startled the moose.
Simon and Miguel began to panic.
The situation soon got more absurd.
The moose was still trotting towards Tyee’s unprotected rear.
Simon felt desperate.
"We have to do something."
"Tyee!"
The scream echoed across the meadow.
Startled, Tyee looked up.
Simon and Miguel slid down from their perch.
They were both so relieved that they began to laugh.
An eagle soared high above.
Their scruffy coats were russet with grey patches.
Simon and Miguel were worried.
The young pups howled.
The surprise on their faces was clear.
Tyee smiled and whispered, "Kermode."
The First Nations’ people called the Kermode the Spirit Bear.
Tyee smiled and pointed to Miguel.
"Simon, do you understand?"
We are all the same – but different."
COMPANIONS – THE STRANGEST DREAMS!
• Alexander Mackenzie
• Merriweather Lewis and William Clark
• Emperor Zhu Di’s loyal eunuch admirals
This early morning, Miguel sensed Simon’s absence.
"Are you alright Simon?"
Simon smiled and nodded his head.
"I had the strangest dreams!"
"A nightmare?"
Miguel was curious.
"Tell me."
"In the first dream, I saw our Captain."
"It was a nightmare!"
Simon laughed.
"No.
But it was strange.
This man’s hand was covered in dirt.
"That was it?"
"That was it for the first dream.
"Weird!
Miguel, they were huge!
They grew food on the decks.
But Miguel, these men – something was different."
Simon squeezed his legs together.
"The captain held up a wooden pulley.
Miguel, I recognized the pulley.
Miguel turned to leave.
He cocked his head to listen.
"I was Captain of a mighty ship.
"I was not!"
"Oh, yes you were!
Miguel fumed.
Simon laughed.
"It wasn’t me."
Miguel gritted his teeth.
Miguel pricked up his ears, "Except??"
"Careful."
"Not funny Simon."
"Relax, relax.
You’ll like my next dream better.
The rock was as big as the Rock of Gibraltar.
Again, a group of native people appeared.
They scared me.
I kept turning like a ship traveling around the globe!"
"You’re strange Simon.
Of course all you Englishmen are strange!"
Miguel fell silent.
"They were chasing me.
Miguel was intrigued with all these strange dreams.
"What happened next?"
"I feel so low Miguel.
I don’t care about some Northwest Passage.
I don’t care about claiming land for the King.
I am sick.
My belly is on fire.
I want to go home!!"
Miguel, Simon’s young Cuban shipmate, spoke compassionately.
I will talk to the Doctor."
He will give me more of that castor oil.
It makes me feel worse not better!"
Miguel understood.
My grandmother would know just what to do.
I would sleep and sleep.
Language was difficult; so many peoples, so many languages.
"I love the smell of this cedar wood Simon.
The palm is the symbol of Cuba.
It represents our dignity and determination.
Simon looked around.
Tyee took him to his grandmother.
Simon resisted.
She is looking for the pox.
And don’t cover yourself Simon.
She is checking you for syphilis."
Miguel and Tyee left Simon to rest.
"Come."
The salmon were returning to spawn.
Tyee picked up a fishing spear.
Tyee bent his knees and twisted his broad back.
In three minutes he had three fish.
Simon wanted to try the technique.
He waded over to a swampy pool of kelp beds.
The battle was not over.
The animal was determined and strong.
The break was bad but clean.
Simon’s arm splayed out from his body.
Miguel and Tyee laughed and laughed.
Simon didn’t share their amusement.
His melancholy returned.
Do we really belong here?"
Simon didn’t sleep well that night.
History is full of interesting facts and details.
These stories will enrich your students’ learning.

"Down to the galley with you lad!
Bring me some food and not those rotten ship’s biscuits.
They are crawling with weevils!
Tell Monsieur Georges to send a bottle of wine.
Simon thought fast.
Yes Sir.
Miguel was his best friend.
They were the youngest on board.
He flung his arm out.
Miguel was the cook’s assistant and he had a temper.
The boys hated the taste of the lemons.
"Fine lads these, Mr. Brooks.
You’ll never have to discipline them.
"YES SIR!" they answered in unison.
"Good then.
Monsieur Georges chuckled as he stirred the dinner stew.
Simon looked at Miguel.
What would you like?"
Mr. Brooks scratched his head.
"You can’t fool me laddy.
I’ll take one-eighth.
And be quick about it!"
"OW!"
Miguel screamed and Simon grinned.
"What’s that for?"
"Do not play innocent with Monsieur Georges, young man.
I know my numbers!
Now out of here, both of you."
Simon and Miguel felt left out.
"Please Sir.
May we join the Midshipmen and go swimming.
Simon’s mouth fell open.
"Of course not Sir.
I would never do that!
I promise!"
COURSE – the direction of the ship at sea.
And I want to walk on the quarterdeck!"
"Those guys are so snobby!
Let’s put some fresh weevils in their soup tonight!"
Both boys laughed.
Sailors considered the front the head and hence the name.
TATTOO Tattoos are permanent marks embedded into the body.
"YEAH!
It even bled a little bit."
"I miss Cuba.
If he goes to China, he gets a dragon.
"You can’t whip him mate!
He’s only a boy.
Sailors were very superstitious.
Miguel’s eyes widened like big, round plates.
"No way Miguel.
Simon shook his head.
"Look.
It’s true.
I’ve been measuring you on this bulwark.
You are growing too fast.
Here a biscuit is all you get.
Admiral - in charge of several ships.
The stronger the rum the longer it lasted.
SCURVY - scurvy was a dreaded disease at sea.
The gums bleed and the teeth fall out.
 back Monsieur Georges mumbled to himself.
"Nobody appreciates me!
Do they thank me?
No!
He continued talking to himself.
"Look at this scrumptious biscuit.
I made them with my own hands.
I try to pick out the weevils.
I even spread molasses on them for sweetness.
And still they complain.
‘Tastes like my shoe’, one of the lads complained.
No wonder I threw my cooking pot at him."
The sails are held in place by the spars.
No wonder I’m so skinny."
"Hey Simon."
Miguel ignored his friend’s complaining.
Simon shrugged.
"The hold is full of them.
They’re eating all the biscuits!"
"Get me one!
Those Midshipmen called me a ‘Cuban mulatto’.
They are usually three feet wide and six feet long.
"Quit complaining.
It’s the only clothes you wear – you whelp!"

A Map Showing the Voyages of Captain Cook EXPLORER:
Captain James Cook (1728-1779)   FROM:
England  SAILED WITH:
He died of his terrible wound.
That raises many questions.
The first departed in 1768.
Cook returned to Britain on July 12, 1771.
They arrived home on October 4, 1780.
Cook was writing of his visit to Nootka Sound.
Cook is looked upon as a competent, accurate navigator.
Bottom:
Expeditions of exploration uncovered these paths.
In Haida society, there are two lines.
Tetaku was invited to travel aboard the Mexicana.
Museums can inspire reflection and further research.
Active research continues to look into these rumours.

Meriwether Lewis (1774-1809) and William Clark (1770-1838)  FROM:
Lewis entered the military as a young man.
In 1813, Clark became governor of the Missouri Territory.
Dogs were also important to Lewis and Clark.
Artist:
Alexander Mackenzie (c.
1763 [exact date of birth unknown]-1820)  FROM:
They took a stream west.
This took him to South America in 1789.
His outspokenness may have landed him in prison.
The writings verged on treason.
Captain Jose Bustamante y Guerra sailed the Atrevida.
Cayetano Valdés sailed aboard the Descubierta with Malaspina.

Captain George Vancouver (1757-1798)  FROM:
Britain  SAILED WITH:
He finally returned to Britain in 1789.
At six we spoke her.
However, Roberts was called to duty in the West Indies.
In August of 1794, Vancouver wrote in his journal:

Sacagawea received nothing in return for her valuable skills.
It was also on the terms of the coastal peoples.

MMBC 998.038.001 - 16th Century Astrolabe, Reproduction.
This instrument was a long staff with a movable cross-bar.
Like the astrolabe, the backstaff measured latitude.
The bow is often decorated with carved and painted figures.
Charts were created with the process of hydrographic survey.
Running surveys could be carried out from the ship.
But explorers and kings wanted precision.
With this "sighting," a position could be calculated.
Some stars appear to be "fixed."

See how that became flat?
Which was that the planet is finite.
Every stream was owned, every resource.
This takes a matter of several years.
And of course, it was difficult.

Birenbaum, Joanna and Bruce Porter Screening Rights:
Last Updated: 2008-03-28 Important Notices
We wished to make our process as transparent as possible.
Our consultation process had different streams.
These public meetings were announced in the local media.
We also held expert meetings on specific subjects areas.
Terminology
(a) The Proposed Model
(b) Step 1 – Initial Inquiries from the Public
This group of complaints may proceed at the same time.
(c) Step 2 – Filing a Claim with the Tribunal
We recommend that claims be filed directly with the Tribunal.
(d) Step 3 – The Tribunal Process
A claimant might require assistance for this purpose.
The Commission would continue to develop partnerships with community organizations.
(e) Step 4 – Case Management
It would retain its current adjudicative function.
The pre-hearing process should be as expeditious as possible.
There are several approaches to this issue.
This is the standard in civil proceedings in the courts.
However, this type of system is problematic.
For these reasons, the system was eliminated in 1993.
In establishing a set of criteria, the Commission should consider:
The period could be between 30 and 90 days.
The material might still be useful to the parties.
(h) Step 7 – Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) Mechanism
(i) Step 8 – Tribunal Disclosure Powers
However, we do not want to suggest overly technical rules.
The answers would become evidence.
(k) Step 10 – Interim Orders
(l) Step 11 – Status Hearings
(m) Step 12 – Interventions
(o) Step 14 – The Hearing
(q) Step 16 – The Orders
We discuss this amendment in chapter three.
The problem is how to enforce the time limits.
(r) Step 17 – Enforcement of Tribunal Orders
(s) Step 18 – Appeals of a Tribunal Order
Chapter 11 Assistance in the Claims Process
The lawyer does not technically represent the complainant.
This will be particularly true in the federal sector.
The Panel considered two basic models.
It would provide some choice of local counsel to claimants.
The legal aid model also creates a number of difficulties.
(b) The Clinic Model
The Tribunal hearing is usually seen as the last resort.
There are many forms of alternative dispute resolution.
Some are particular to specific fields.
The investigator cannot be appointed as the conciliator as well.
They consult their managers.
Most provincial commissions have a mediation process.
Tribunal members receive formal training in mediation.
A number of specific questions arise.
Mediation should take place early in the process.
If So, Who Decides and According to What Rules?
To do otherwise would remove the incentive to negotiate.
The following initiatives may help:
• rehearsing the ground rules for negotiation;
• making sure translation services are available;
• allowing the parties to end mediation.
We recommend that mediation be confidential.
We recommend that mediators be adequately trained for the task.
This creates a number of problems.
Many collective agreements now contain anti-discrimination provisions.
This seems to us to be anomalous.
(Federally Regulated Employers – Transportation and Communication [FETCO]) "[...]
However, this referral power is currently discretionary.
Our concern with this approach is one of institutional expertise.
All would have access to the Tribunal.
This could serve to limit the liability of an employer.
Chapter 14 Who May File a Claim?
The present chapter deals with:
• the power of the Commission to initiate claims;
• the power to file claims in a representative capacity.
11), harassment (s.
The following elements should be present:
• the issues should not be hypothetical;
These individuals should be capable of being identified.
Part Three:
Previous | Table of Contents | Next (a) Structure
The Commission can make by-laws governing its affairs.
A "division" of the Commission cannot make by-laws by itself.
These include:
• sponsoring research;
• initiating complaints;
• providing advice on affirmative action plans;
These would be:
• monitoring the enforcement of Tribunal orders;
• initiating inquiries and making recommendations;
• preparing policies, guidelines and carrying out rule-making activity;
• designing and carrying out educational and research programs;
• carrying out international activities;
This is the option we recommend.
One possible option is the establishment of an Advisory Council.
The Advisory Council would be composed of about twelve members.
This should be continued and strengthened.
(b) Appointments
Appointments should be staggered to ensure further continuity.
Chapter 16 The Commission's Reporting Function
This provision enhanced the independence of the Commission.
Reporting also serves a strong educational purpose.
This is something the Commission will have to develop itself.
Similar indicators could be used to assess services.
• help the Commission set priorities;
• respond to the Auditor General of Canada's recommendations.
Part Four:
Scope of the Act Chapter 17 Grounds
It could be the same for multiple sclerosis.
(b) Political Belief
However, others suggested caution.
(c) Criminal Conviction or Charge
Regulations will reduce litigation in obvious cases.
(d) Gender Identity
This would allow the term to develop case by case.
(e) Social Condition
None of the current grounds are specifically economic in nature.
They wanted the Act to become that instrument.
It is itself a major cause of poverty." [...]
Newfoundland's legislation uses the term "social origin."
What Does "Social Condition" Mean?
Jurisprudence has developed over time.
This is how stereotypes work.
Does Such Discrimination Come Within Federal Jurisdiction?
Barriers to services exist within federal jurisdiction.
Some banks are moving out of lower income neighbourhoods.
However, some of the other criteria are open to debate.
Don't worry, we say.
Of course not.
Their mothers are forced to feed them."
Women still earn less than men on average.
We hope so.
In our view, this is not appropriate for two reasons.
The Tribunal's remedial powers are also relatively broad.
(f) Social and Economic Rights and the Act
• the equal rights of spouses;
There are also a number of constitutional concerns.
The Commission already has some of these powers.
(g) Language
Chapter 18 Exceptions to the Act
Previous | Table of Contents | Next (a) Mandatory Retirement
Other such policies have been upheld.
However, demographic trends do not support this hypothesis.
These trends in the labour force should be studied.
The Canadian Forces is one of these.
This deserves further study.
(b) Pensions and Insurance
The Panel considered whether the current approach should be changed.
The provinces have similar legislation.
Insurance and pensions provide significant benefits to employees.
For example, Saskatchewan limits such distinctions to age.
Alberta adds marital status.
This is the current approach in the Act.
This obviously creates a distinction based on age.
This is discussed in detail in chapter seventeen.
It has been in force for a long time now.
(c) The Indian Act Exception
However, the Indian Act remains in effect.
What Does Section 67 Mean?
The Tribunal found this to be discriminatory.
They identified three programs in particular:
Only 87 of 610 Chiefs in Canada are women.
Others believed that Aboriginal governments were not democratic.
We are afraid of being excluded.
It's a question I'm asking.
Should Section 67 be Retained, Modified or Repealed?
What Kind of Balancing Provision is Needed?
A Balancing Provision Like Section 25 of the Charter?
This would be consistent with the principle of self-government.
There is precedent for this in the Act now.
Parliament had tailored the prohibition to meet its objective.
Organizations could be involved in complaint proceedings.
We do not think it does.
The Internet is not.
Chapter 19 Other Issues
The question is whether these limits are still appropriate.
The Department thought that this would be inappropriate.
(b) Clarification of the Definition of Employment Under the Act
This probably covers most contracts for services.
This would apply to the situation of consultants.
(c) Successor Employers and Service Providers
In the case of Goyette v. Voyageur Colonial Ltd.
Another source of information would be the Tribunal.
(d) Harassment
The Code defines sexual harassment.
"The Institute would support the inclusion of a definition.
(e) Retaliation
Discussion The criminal offence of retaliation creates some problems.
It covers the chartered banks.
Crown Corporations employed 72,000 people in 1997/1998.
Many will have the benefit of in-house legal service units.
Some of these employers may be very centralized.
Many of the collective agreements themselves contain anti-discrimination provisions.
There were about 179,000 public servants in 1999.
The government has also increased its use of contract workers.
Scope of the Act.
That process will be commencing soon.
This has become known as a formalistic kind of equality.
This was called systemic discrimination.
That meant that "...the Act (s.
This is an important orientation.
The purpose provision serves a strong symbolic function.
Should the Act Protect Only Disadvantaged Groups?
A Definition of Discrimination?
The Act now prohibits certain defined discriminatory practices.
Systemic Discrimination
This reactive method is a bottomless pit.
(Canadian Ethnocultural Council)
We recommend that this section be repealed.
The Tribunal decided the case in 1984.
• To implement its anti-sexual harassment directive.
I have already stressed that systemic discrimination is often unintentional.
The matter went to a Tribunal in 1995.
The Action Travail des Femmes case illustrates this point.
First, sexual harassment has not been eliminated.
(page two) ...
• to maintain prescribed employment equity records;
Many federal employers are not covered by the EEA.
Services are not covered by the EEA.
We understand the force of those suggestions.
This is now the basic primacy rule.
The rule has since been restated in other cases.
The concept of primacy serves two functions.
The two functions are intertwined.
Part Two:
It does this in a number of ways.
The Commission itself may initiate complaints.
The Commission usually appoints an investigator to investigate a complaint.
Education The Commission has a broad educational mandate.
What is Needed for a Revitalized Act?
We will deal with these tools in the upcoming chapters.
Chapter 5 Internal Responsibility Model
• the organization did not consent to the discriminatory act;
This is a policy that can be expanded as well.
The employer has control over the workplace.
In our view, responsibility should follow control.
Our starting point is this statement of liability.
However, the different models contained features that deserve consideration.
This requires some training in spotting such barriers.
These committees typically:
• consult with professional and technical experts;
There is training for officials and employees.
No committee processes individual complaints.
The human resources department looks after complaints.
However, in its Guideline 3:
Should the Committees be Mandatory?
Chapter 6 Regulatory Compliance Scheme
Such regulations are law.
There are very few Guidelines.
(Council of Canadians with Disabilities).
They also play an important educational role.
The next question is who should make these regulations.
Such policies set out minimum standards.
There is an Aircraft Code and a Rail Code.
Chapter 7 An Inquiry Power
The rules of procedural fairness naturally should apply.
The inquiry would also not determine civil or criminal liability.
Chapter 8 Education and Promotion of Equality
• sponsoring research;
• initiating complaints;
• providing advice on affirmative action plans;
These are, broadly speaking, educational and promotional instruments.
We are very much in agreement with this statement.
Many of the issues they deal with are the same.
Work would be required on how to fund such programs.
(b) The Commission's International Activities
Chapter 9 Reform of the Complaint Process
The remedies for discrimination have become more powerful.
Important findings in the Report were:
They included:
• ensure legislative authority for mediation policies and procedures.
(B'nai Brith Canada ) III.
This is a critical area that needs to be addressed.
They wrote:
This model would address delays in several ways.
The "triage" official would consider:
• whether the complaint was amenable for mediation;
• whether it was filed too late;
• whether a full-scale investigation was needed;
The Commissioner could be empowered to dismiss cases:
• for lack of jurisdiction;
• where the complaint was made in bad faith; or
• where the complaint was filed too late.
All other cases would be referred to the Tribunal.
Claims would be filed directly with the Tribunal.
The delay at the Commission stage would be eliminated.
Conclusion and Summary of Options Option 1:
Remove s.67 from the Indian Act Option 3:
Section 67 of the CHRA states the following:
These options are discussed in turn below 1.
The legislative purpose behind s.67 is, of course, defensible.
A court has not yet addressed such questions.
Should the CHRA apply to such self-government agreements?
Leave s.67 as is without any changes.
Advantages:
Disadvantages:
Implications:
Option 2:
  Implications:
The following options may be cumulative or individually implemented.
Some distinctions based on age are permitted.
The Regulations provide for some distinctions based on sex.
Options for the future:
Only P.E.I.'s Code defines the term.
The implication of these statistics are unclear.
• Is [section 67 of the CHRA] still necessary?
Arguments for Option 1:
Arguments Against Option 1:
• This option recognizes the distinctive status of Aboriginal peoples.

◦ 4 objectives 1.
• Follow-up
• The Office she heads has two components.
The following observations were made:
The strategic plan focuses on four objectives: 1.
Comments:
It has established a permanent forum for this purpose.
The groups identified as priority clienteles are the following:
Prioritized Programs and Services are:
• The Family Violence Initiative;
• Child-centred Family Justice Strategy;
• Public Legal Education and Information Component;
Direct outcomes: 1.
A positive change has already been noted in this regard.
Ultimate outcome:
In conclusion:
• training;
• a network of bilingual Crown attorneys.
It is not a decisional body.
It has a strong mandate.
Following this exercise, questions are raised:
• Who will do what?
Some roles are more government-related, others more community-related.
The list includes approximately 250 names and is growing.
Sub-Committee members will receive quarterly mailings.
Is there a link with communities in that respect?
• What is the scope of the word "consultation"?
• Why are there two meetings a year?
• Canadian Heritage guide: proposed template for use by departments;
• Draft 5-year Action Plan (2005-2010).
JUSTICE AND THE COMMUNITIES:
HOW ARE WE DOING?
The situation of services varies between provinces.
Sometimes, a simple poster would suffice.
• This should become automatic.
• An important element is the justice network.
Justice is also education, information, training, etc.
• For women, justice if a key issue.
This can create even more confusion for citizens.
However, a consultation for youth would be a good start.
The Official Languages Act is not clearly understood.
Participants made additional comments:
• What contact information should be disseminated?
Who should people be directed to?
Twenty-one (21) questionnaires were compiled.

Suggestions for the next meeting
• Very good meeting!
• Summary version of basic documentation and use of overheads.
• Simplify the writing.
• Consider holding it in a minority location.
Return to Advisory Sub-Committee
Information strategies need to be continued.
• Follow-up
• The key word is "useful".
• The key word is "partnerships".
• Section 41 requires senior managers to be involved.
There are different ways to do this.
Jurists had no knowledge of programs at Justice Canada.
The Department of Justice itself ensures that the link.
Two sub-committees deal with different groups of community stakeholders:
• a network of bilingual Crown attorneys.
It is not a decisional body.
Additional comments:
This initiative came following the Environment Scan.
It helps draw attention from deputy ministers of Justice.
There are Justice Canada programs in Quebec.
Its focus is on the Criminal Code.
Questions and observations followed:
• Environmental analysis: 16 November 2002;
• Consultations: 18-20 November 2002;
• Logic model and evaluation procedures: 6 October 2003;
• Canadian Heritage guide: proposed template for use by departments;
• It will be interesting to start a dialogue.
Some ideas may come forward.
Some partnerships with majority groups already exist.
Strategies need to be built.
It needs to have a surveillance function and raise awareness.

• Independence of the judiciary;
• Respect for fundamental human rights;
• A justice system that is a factor in development.
The Action Plan establishes the following three objectives:
His comments may be summarized as follows:
Department of Justice of Canada May 1999

• Legal Dualism
Part I:
Every participant in the judicial process has that right.
However, the sections that follow are clearer.
It contains no significant changes.
Parliament has specified a number of obligations in section 530.1:
The case law is inconsistent.
Some rights are applicable throughout the province:
• a judge who speaks both languages;
The Court of Appeal rejected his request.
In R v. Lefebvre (No.
Rules are bilingual.
Rules of Interpretation applicable to Language Rights:
Part IV:
The British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.
That language will not necessarily be the dominant language.
• The following counties:
• Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry
• The following territorial districts:
• The Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth.
• The Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton.
• The Regional Municipality of Peel.
• The Regional Municipality of Sudbury.
• The City of Toronto.
• filing a requisition
• making an oral statement to the court
• filing a written statement with the court
Geography There are francophones living in all parts of Ontario.
Ottawa-Carleton, Prescott-Russell and Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry.
This represents a response rate of 17%.
One person did not identify his or her occupation.
A number of factors explain this approach.
Northern Ontario, Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Central Ontario and Southern Ontario.
Those proportions vary from one area to another.
In the other three regions, the responses were more divided.
The following are the major barriers identified by these actors.
This could be done orally and/or in writing.
• Consulting the AJEFs when judges are appointed.

The Court of Quebec consists of three divisions:
• The Criminal and Penal Division
Dawson, Vanier and John Abbott.
• Heritage College in Hull serves western Quebec.
The judicial system is essentially unilingual francophone.
Often, the person has to wait longer."
Some courthouses have no bilingual personnel.
The participants assume that the same is true in Montreal.
In the other regions, the difficulties described are quite real.
Francophones make up 2% of the total population.
They are, however, concentrated in two regions.
Also, Saskatchewan does have an AJEF.
The response rate for this province was 34%.
Only one lawyer reports working in French.
The federal government could consider:
• Establishing a bilingual Provincial Court in Regina and Saskatoon.
• Verifying the language proficiency of legal aid lawyers.
Date Modified: 2008-03-28 Top of Page Important Notices
• Contact Us
These are listed below.
• Assist in recruiting bilingual judicial personnel.
• Monitor the quality of interpreters.
Provincial Governments
• Appoint more bilingual judges to the provincial court.
However, that right is limited to oral communication.
There is an association of French-speaking lawyers in Alberta.
Of that 4%, 29% request services in French.
However, it has dropped considerably since that time.
Cases are heard in English only.
Duty counsels are not bilingual.
Most often, they decide to proceed in English.
• Appointing more bilingual judges.
• Providing more funding for the AJEFA.
• Having the province's principal statutes translated into French.
Geography Francophones are found in every part of British Columbia.
Vancouver, Surrey, Burnaby and Coquitlam, which includes Maillardville.
There are no francophone institutions at the post-secondary level.
They studied common law and civil law.
In total, 12 people were consulted in British Columbia.
They are afraid of being regarded badly.
• Appointing more bilingual judges.
• Appointing bilingual prosecutors.
• Appointing bilingual judicial personnel.
• Adopting a French Services Act.
That Court is composed of two divisions:
• the Appeal Division, which sits in Charlottetown, and
The Trial Division is further divided into four sections:
That Court has jurisdiction over criminal and quasi-criminal cases.
However, most of these provisions have not been proclaimed.
Two of them agreed to participate.
The Rules of Procedure have not been translated into French.
The language of the courts is English.
Cases are heard by a court officer.
• the Manitoba Provincial Court (Criminal Division) and
They have centred around Saint Boniface.

Where can you get more information?
There is no excuse for abuse.
It is not your fault.
Child abuse is also against the law.
Is it better to stay or to leave?
In making your decision, ask yourself:
• Is there a gun in the house?
In an emergency, you can also call 911.
If you can, save some money.
Look for friends and family members who will help you.
With long-term help, some abusers have learned to stop.
Apply to the court immediately for a custody order.
Call a provincial or territorial government office for advice.
What happens if you report the abuser?
You will have to tell the police about the abuse.
The court may set conditions for his release.
Will the abuser be removed from Canada?
• Does the abuser keep you from seeing your family?
Other Look for other sources of help!

I think there might be."
Male1:
Female1:

Part 2
The following topics were covered:
Challenge:
According to Ms. Nadeau, this is a growing niche market.
For example, "Sentinels of the Sea:
"Some tourism stakeholders are interested.
Visitors are more independent.
"Carrying capacity is important."
"We change our programming almost every day.
Our programming is not available in advance and can change.
It forces us to work with a lot of partners.
Detailed programming information is not available.
It is inconsistent."
We would have thought and acted differently."
"Days like today give us confidence!"
"Marketplaces are not always the place for us.
Boston and the other markets are expensive to develop.
An Overview of the Project
Packaging the Potential, CTC, 2000
These two partners recognized the chance to
A Unique Cultural Experience!" was a resounding success.
A Unique Cultural Experience!
Culture has long been a part of tourism.
BIENVENUE QUÉBEC 2002 featured the following components:

The orientation session for cultural organizations was a great success.

In fact, culture has become part and parcel of tourism.
See the definition in Section 3.1 of this document.
See general description in Section 4 of this document.

Parks & Outdoor Tourism Operators
A summary of the findings overall reveals that:
Delivering Park messaging to all visitors !
Ensuring safety for park visitors !
RELATIONSHIPS AND TRUST Building Trust is Required
✜There is a mutual lack of trust.
COMMUNICATIONS Dialogue Between Parks and Industry
Opportunities for Communication are Sometimes Limited ✔ Discussions:
➪ Written or Electronic Information:
They include: wildlife, safety, and ecosystem management messages.
Best Practices in Natural Heritage Collaborations:
Provide appropriate opportunities in accordance with guidelines !
These include:
Planning:
Analysing:
Extracting and Evaluating:
Some chapters have more specific functions.
Planning Long Term Planning Challenge:
Good Practices:
The association:
Views of Role of Parks Challenge:
In other provinces this concern is echoed.
Agency comments reflect some of this paradox.
Some operators don’t share these views.
British Columbia Parks, "BC Parks":
They feel that agencies are missing a powerful opportunity.
Nahanni River Adventures:
•
•
Gaboteux Tours, in Nova Scotia:
Operators want rules to be fair and equitable.
So do Parks Agencies.
The manner of implementation is a challenge.
The reaction was then to close the licenses.
Agencies have mixed feelings about traditional use.
Operator perspectives are mixed:
Some operators worry about commodification of licenses.
Bluewater Adventures:
(e.g., tender process, call for proposals)."
Some operators say:
Good Practice:
This creates business difficulties.
We need to know what ‘activities’ agencies are contemplating.
Standardised, Clear Regulatory Processes Desired Challenge:
For example, parks may or may not have:
BC Parks has a standardised process:
•
Good Practice:
Earth Rhythms is "trying to advocate for environmental screening.
A service based operation; 2.
Another type of operation.
"I will be participating in the Management Plan review.
Relationships and Trust Building Trust is Required Challenge:
We are seen to have hidden agendas."
A westcoast Park:
This has led to distrust."
Ongoing or Informal Relationship:
White Mountain Adventures:
Algonquin Outfitters, Ontario:
Nahanni River Adventures:
Pacific Rim NP:
Gwaii Haanas: "
Kayakouch, in New Brunswick, suggests:
Greater openness is required to improve trust."
Whose Park is it?
Agencies sometimes share this view.
Waterton Lakes NP:
Nature Trek Canada:
Open, Inclusive Approach:
Perhaps training would help.
Longer Contracts:
An Environment of Security is Desired Challenge:
Open communication is required.
This continuity [of Management] has been a highlight"
Suggestion:
Knowledge of Business Environment Challenge:
Quotas and Lotteries Introduced:
They have a daily quota.
All are suspicious when we bring in changes".
So they put limits on access.
They feel this is not reasonable.
Maybe there are better times to reduce hours?
Sharing Information is a Win-Win for Everyone Challenge:
Overcoming the reluctance of some parties to share information.
Best Practices in Natural Heritage Collaborations:
A Prairies operator says:
White Mountain Adventures summarises:
We are often the eyes and ears in the Parks.
We are the conduit for the parks message.
Communication Dialogue Between Parks and Industry Challenge:
Operator:
Discussions:
That's it.
Easy.
Simple.
Painless.
Openness & Compromise:
Nature Trek Canada in BC says:
Formal Communications and Training:
Kluane/ Chilkoot/ Vuntut NPs say:
Training:
Meetings - Formal & Informal, Individual & Group:
Newsletters:
Industry Representation:
Written or Electronic Information:
Field Communications & Feedback:
Kayakouch suggests more talks and exchange of ideas.
Workshops and Training:
Kananaskis Country suggests:
Standardisation of Communications Process Challenge:
To have a standard process of communication.
Communication with the General Public Challenge:
Jasper NP:
We target and distribute visitors based on park strategies.
We financially support park interpretive programs.
One the other hand, some parks communicate very well.
Operators Present Parks Programs:
Newsletter:
Kootenay/ Yoho NPs comment:
Operators Hire Parks Staff:
There is no consistency between Supers.
Community Relationships Challenge:
Parks Resource Constraints Challenge:
But, this all failed.
The Regional Director gave up."
Agencies agree.
Agency Support from Operators:
A concern is:
WBNP/ Nahanni NP says:
The days when park wardens were game wardens?
Lack of Practical Definition:
Tours of Exploration:
Clarify the Practical Implications of Ecological Integrity Challenge:
Kananskis Country says:
Concerns about Extremes in Implementation:
Illegal or Inappropriate Activities Continue:
Their points include:
Operators say unguided visitors need controls.
Company Goals
Many operators provide such interpretive opportunities.
Discuss Parks Mandate Great Divide:
Great Divide staff have:
• We follow ecotourism guidelines.
FreshAir Adventures practices conservation on all their trips.
We do not rent accommodation to people arriving with jet-skis.
Tours of Exploration keeps a minimum group size.
Strider Adventures has maximum groups of 10 people.
Québec Hors-Circuit also uses small groups.
We pack out what we pack in."
Kananaskis Country commends Inside Out Experience Adventure Tours.
Environmental Stewardship & Messaging:
Prince Albert NP commends CanoeSki Discovery.
Visitor Conduct Guidance:
Clients comply."
Submit Sightings and Information Reports and Research:
Leave No Trace (LNT) Practices:
BC Parks would like to see operators:
Best Practices in Natural Heritage Collaborations:
Manitoba Parks:
Greater use of parks interpretive staff."
Provide use of edu-kits for private trips.
Best Practices in Natural Heritage Collaborations:
Our programs help to fill some of the gap."
Butterfly Tours offers local courses for kayaking.
Maintenance:
Jamie’s Whaling Station, BC:
Research:
This program relates to both park and non-park lands.
Marketing Parks Role Challenge:
Great Divide:
But other agencies do this".
Marketing Collaborations Challenge:
They cover all related costs.
Some marketing activities include:
• Selling Permits:
Distribute Parks Brochures:
Park Admission Sales:
Film Materials:
• Distribute Operator Brochures:
Referrals:
Best Practices in Natural Heritage Collaborations:
Cooperative Promotions:
This helps maintain the integrity of the product."
It would appear to indicate that demand is increasing."
Such illegal activity makes legitimate operators really frustrated.
Algonquin Outfitters:
Kanata Adventures:
Great Divide:
Gros Morne NP:
All commercial users must be forced to comply."
Monitoring Standards, Guidelines and Activities Challenge:
Unfortunately, these guidelines are not being adhered to.
Opportunities Challenge:
They also feel school groups have potential.
Operators are willing to collaborate:
Parks could take various initiatives:
Suggested Future Actions Challenge:
Operators are interested in improving through feedback.
Let’s hope that improves.

Astronomers Introduction Introduction video What is Astronomy?
Often considered the oldest science, it was born of our amazement at the sky and our need to question Astronomy is the science of space beyond Earth’s atmosphere.
The name is derived from the Greek root astron for star, and nomos for arrangement or law.
Astronomy is concerned with celestial objects and phenomena – like stars, planets, comets and galaxies – as well as the large-scale properties of the Universe, also known as "The Big Picture".
More specifically, astronomy is the study of the origin and evolution of the Universe, the physics and chemistry of celestial objects, and the calculation of their positions and motions.
For most people, astronomy represents a world that is both mysterious and grandiose – a story about glimmering celestial objects and the immensity of the cosmos.
It prompts us to ask the deepest existential questions:
Who are we?
Where did we come from?
Are we alone?
The lure of these universal enigmas was the spark that ignited the passion of many of today’s famous astronomers.
Astronomy also plays a much more practical role that is not nearly as important today as it was in the past.
Since the time of our earliest ancestors, humans have used the motions of celestial objects to position themselves in space and time.
Prehistoric humans studied the relationship between the seasons and the length of days to plan their hunting and gathering activities.
It was also by observing the positions of the stars that the first farmers decided when to plant and when to harvest, and early navigators could sail the oceans blue.
In the Age of Antiquity, astrometry – the measurement of the positions of stars and planets – was the main occupation of astronomers.
There was some degree of interest for astronomy from the general public as well, since they believed that the positions of celestial objects influenced events that took place on Earth.
 During the Renaissance, advances in mathematics coupled with the invention of new observational instruments (like the refracting telescope) gave rise to modern astronomy.
From the 19th century onwards, the discovery of the electromagnetic spectrum and the world of the atom spurred on the development of astrophysics, a new discipline in astronomy that is now considered to be the most important.
Today, astronomy covers several disciplines:
◦ Astrometry, which is the precise measurement of the position of stars and planets, and which is greatly facilitated by the use of modern CCD cameras and computers
◦ Stellar astronomy, which is the study of the origins and evolution of stars
◦ Galactic astronomy, which studies the structure and components of galaxies
◦ Astrophysics, which studies the Universe and the physics of its constituents (luminosity, temperature, chemical composition)
◦ Cosmology, which studies the origin and evolution of the Universe as a whole Related to these fields of research are two disciplines that lie more within the domain of geologists and biologists: planetary science, which is the study of asteroids, comets and planets, and astrobiology, which studies the possibility of life in the Universe.
Nowadays, professional astronomers have a strong background in astrophysics and their observations are almost always examined in an astrophysical context.
The most serious amateurs actively participate in the study of variable stars, the discovery of new asteroids or comets, and other exciting astronomical work.

Astronomers « Return to the observatories The first astronomical observations in Canada The era of explorers and Jesuits The history of Canadian astronomy began when the first European explorers used astronomical observations to guide them over the ocean and to navigate our waterways.
John Cabot, who discovered Newfoundland in 1497, and Jacques Cartier, who explored further inland by way of the Saint-Lawrence River in 1534, were undoubtedly the first explorers that used astronomical instruments to locate the landmass now known as Canada.
It was also during the Champlain era that French missionaries, the Jesuits, first set foot on Canadian soil in 1604.
By 1618, they had begun to record astronomical observations (most notably about comets and eclipses) and included them in the reports sent back to France (titled Relations in French).
In 1634, astronomy officially became a part of the tasks assigned to Jean Bourdon, the Engineer-in-Chief and Land Surveyor for the New France colony in Quebec.
During the time of the early settlers, the function of astronomy was primarily practical.
It was the science of colonization par excellence, used to draw up accurate geographic maps and to tell time precisely.

Astronomers « Return to the observatories The first observatories The first astronomical observatory in North America was Canadian It is difficult to confirm with certainty the very first astronomical observatory in Canada.
The Jesuit priest Joseph-Pierre de Bonnécamps, who taught at the College of Quebec from 1750 to 1759, had obtained a number of astronomical instruments with the intention of constructing an observatory on the college roof.
Bonnécamps left Canada in 1759 not long before the fall of Quebec at the hands of the British, and he never returned.
The British closed the College of Quebec and the teaching tasks were transferred to the Seminary of Quebec across the street.
There is mention of an "observation chamber" in the Seminary archives of 1770, which may be a reference to the existence of an astronomical observatory.
Evidence for another early observatory can be found in a wood engraving from a book by the Marquis de Chabert de Cogolin that dates from the time he was at the Fortress of Louisbourg (1750-1751).
Chabert owned several such instruments and it is likely that a temporary observatory existed for a short time in the fortress.
The first North American observatory that existed with historical certainty was at Castle Frederick, the estate founded by Joseph DesBarres at Falmouth, Nova Scotia, in 1765.
Later records describe an observatory on Quebec’s Île Jésus (now "Laval") that was established by Dr. Charles Smallwood de Saint-Martin.
Historical evidence suggests that it was already in existence by 1846.
There is also evidence that in 1849, Dr. James Toldervy of Fredericton, New Brunswick, created an observatory in his garden near the Saint John River.
A year later, in 1850, the Quebec City Observatory was established on the Plains of Abraham.
Built in such a way as to be visible from the port and the Saint Lawrence River, the structure included a large ball that signalled midday when it dropped.
Historical records report the establishment of seven other major observatories from 1850 to the end of the century.
They are: 1.

Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Dominion Observatory The first government observatory and provider of official time in Canada The Dominion Observatory was founded in 1905 in Ottawa, Ontario.
The impetus for Canada’s first government observatory came from the Geological Survey of Canada, which had a pressing need for a service that could supply precise temporal and spatial coordinates for its mapping and topographic surveys.
In those days, only observatories were capable of providing such a service.
William Frederick King, Chief Astronomer for the Department of the Interior, played a key role in setting up the new observatory.
He became its first Director and equipped it with a 35-centimetre telescope, the largest ever installed in Canada.
The first mandate of the observatory was to determine and distribute the exact time to the rest of the country.
King confided this task to Robert Meldrum Stewart, the astronomer who went on to become Director from 1923 to 1946.
More specifically, it was necessary to know the exact moment when certain stars passed their highest point in the sky (the meridian); these were known as "transit times".
Due to the conscientious observation of transit times for many stars, and to the acquisition of a high precision clock in 1929, Stewart gradually established a network of clocks throughout Ottawa’s federal government buildings.
A signal from the observatory’s clock was electronically transmitted to the buildings; in this way, about 700 clocks in Ottawa were able to display precise time by 1930.
After 1941, this time service was extended to the entire country and the Dominion Observatory became the official supplier of time for Canada.
In order to fulfill its second mandate – to provide spatial coordinates for the country – the Dominion Observatory set out to determine the precise position of 3,162 stars in the sky.
This was accomplished by recording 28,000 astronomical observations from 1911 to 1923.
A new project was launched in 1923, and the positions of another 1,368 stars were measured until 1950.
These data – combined with the knowledge of exact time – allowed longitude, latitude and elevation to be calculated with precision for many points across Canada.
As part of its responsibility to the Geological Survey of Canada, the Dominion Observatory was also entrusted with a third mandate: to collect seismic, gravimetric and magnetic geophysical data.
Among the noteworthy events that marked the history of the Dominion Observatory were the apparent discovery of "Planet X" in 1928, the determination of the solar rotation as a function of latitude in the 1930’s, and the discovery of numerous meteor impact sites in Canada.
Scientific institutions in Canada were reorganized in 1970 and the responsibilities of the Dominion Observatory were transferred to the National Research Council of Canada (NRC).
The observatory ceased its activities and the building became the headquarters for the NRC.
In 1974, the telescope was moved to the Helen Sawyer Hogg Observatory of the Canadian Museum of Science and Technology where it remains to this day.

Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Dominion Astrophysical Observatory The first Canadian observatory of international calibre, it once housed the largest telescope in the world The Dominion Astrophysical Observatory was inaugurated in 1918 at Saanich near Victoria, British Columbia.
Its creation was motivated by the growing need of Canadian astronomers to have access to a large world-class telescope.
The observatory immediately achieved international status by housing a 1.83-metre telescope that was the largest operating telescope in the world, although it only held this title for a few months.
The installation of the telescope was largely the work of celebrated Canadian astronomer John Stanley Plaskett, and the instrument was baptized the "Plaskett Telescope" in his honour.
It measured 15 metres long and its mobile parts weighed 42 tonnes.
Plaskett became the first Director of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory and helped it establish an international research reputation very early on.
In 1922, for example, he discovered a binary star and the larger of the two still holds the record as the most massive known binary star.
This celestial body bears the name of "Plaskett’s Star" in his honour.
During subsequent years, Plaskett established the radial velocities of several stars (that is, the speed at which the stars are moving away or toward the observer) and demonstrated that our galaxy, the Milky Way, is rotating.
He was also the first to measure the size, mass and rotational speed of the Milky Way.
He also established that the Sun is located at 2/3 the distance from the centre of our galaxy to its edge, and that our solar system takes approximately 22 million years to complete one galaxial rotation.
In 1940, the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory was the site of two other major discoveries.
Andrew McKellar, one of the observatory’s astronomers, became the first researcher to detect the presence of matter in interstellar space when he identified the spectral bands for the organic compounds cyanogen ("CN") and methyne ("CH").
One year later, in 1941, he determined the temperature of the cyanogen molecules and deduced that the interstellar environment in which they are found is very cold, approximately -270 °C.
It was the first direct measurement of the temperature of the Universe.
In 1962, the observatory acquired a second telescope measuring 1.22 metres in diameter.
Equipped with only a spectroscope, it was mainly used to study binary stars.
In 1970, the responsibility of the observatory was conferred to the National Research Council of Canada.
In 1981, the observatory received a third telescope measuring 40 centimetres across.
It was primarily used for scientific research, notably the study of gas clouds in our galaxy (the Milky Way), and to test instruments destined for large telescopes.
Today it is used to show the sky to the general public.
In 1995, the observatory became the headquarters for the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, which operates several telescopes (optical and radio) in Canada and shares many others with various countries elsewhere in the world, including the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Gemini telescopes.
In 2001, the observatory inaugurated an interpretation centre open to the general public all year long and affectionately named "The Centre of the Universe".
It includes a small planetarium and offers interactive displays, multimedia presentations and special events designed to introduce people from all walks of life to the world of astronomy.
Over the years, new instruments were added and many technical improvements were made to the Plaskett Telescope, the observatory’s main telescope.
Today, the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory is the responsibility of the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The David Dunlap Observatory Home to the largest optical telescope in Canada The David Dunlap Observatory opened its doors in 1935 near the small town of Richmond Hill, 25 kilometres north of Toronto, Ontario.
The facility was the property of the University of Toronto and was operated by the astronomy department.
It was created to conduct astronomical research, to assist in the advanced education of university students, and to stimulate the public’s interest in astronomy.
The observatory was mainly the work of Clarence Augustus Chant, a Canadian astronomer and astronomy professor at the University of Toronto.
In 1921, while campaigning to establish a large telescope observatory in the Toronto region, Chant managed to get David Dunlap, a lawyer and mining entrepreneur, interested in the project.
Unfortunately, Dunlap died in 1924, but his widow, Jessie, took up the cause and worked for the next ten years with Chant to make sure the project succeeded.
The observatory was inaugurated the same day that Chant celebrated his 70th birthday, received an honorary doctorate from the University of Toronto, and took his retirement.
At the time of its inauguration, the observatory housed a 1.88-metre telescope, the second largest in the world after the Mount Wilson telescope in the United States, and Canada thus owned two of the four largest telescopes in the world.
The building that houses the administrative offices of the observatory was also inaugurated in 1935.
Over the years, more and more radio astronomers were joining the astronomy department at the University of Toronto, and in the 1960’s, the David Dunlap Observatory actively participated in the development of the Algonquin Radio Observatory in Ontario.
By the end of the 1960’s, the David Dunlap Observatory, being located near the major urban centre of Toronto, found itself plagued with the problem of light pollution.
The observatory responded in 1971 by erecting a 60-centimetre telescope at Las Campanas in Chile.
The David Dunlap Observatory thus acquired international status and the skies of the south were available to Canadian astronomers for the first time.
A spectacular discovery was made at the David Dunlap Observatory in 1972.
Charles Thomas Bolton, one of the observatory’s astronomers, discovered Cygnus X-1, the first black hole ever identified.
In 1987, the observatory was responsible for another amazing discovery thanks to its telescope in Las Campanas.
Ian Shelton, one of the astronomers from the University of Toronto, was using the Chilean telescope when he observed a supernova (1987 A) in the Greater Magellan could.
The discovery made headlines around the world, as it was the first supernova visible to the unaided eye in almost 400 years.
Unfortunately, financial problems forced the David Dunlap Observatory to cease operations at Las Campanas in 1997.
The National Observatory of Argentina took charge of the telescope and moved it from Chile to Parque El Leoncito in Argentina.
The David Dunlap Observatory nonetheless retains one quarter of the observation time at the telescope.
Today, the David Dunlap Observatory of Toronto is still active thanks in part to a light pollution abatement program initiated by Charles Thomas Bolton.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Algonquin Radio Observatory Home to the largest parabolic antenna in Canada The Algonquin Radio Observatory was inaugurated in 1959 at Traverse Lake in the Algonquin National Park in Ontario.
It was created by the National Research Council of Canada for Canadian radio astronomers who needed a site in Ontario where radio interference would be minimal.
The first director was Arthur Edwin Covington, Canada’s first radio astronomer.
More than a decade earlier, in 1946, Covington had collected data on the Sun’s radio flux (the variations in its energy output at radio wavelengths) from a site in Ottawa, and again in 1947 from Goth Hill south of Ottawa.
His work became of paramount importance when he demonstrated that the intensity of solar radiation was related to the Sun’s magnetic activity, which had (and still has) crucial implications for numerous human activities, such as communications systems and power lines.
The Traverse Lake site in Algonquin National Park was selected for the Algonquin Radio Observatory due to its relative isolation from manmade interference.
Covington installed a parabolic mirror with a diameter of 1.83 metres in 1960 and began moving his equipment from Goth Hill in 1962.
The radio telescopes operated continuously at a wavelength of 10.7 centimetres, which is an ideal wavelength for monitoring solar activity due to the Sun’s particular chemical composition.
In 1966, an array consisting of 32 parabolic antennas, each 3 metres in diameter, was added to the observatory.
The goal was to refine the measurements from other radio telescopes by scanning the Sun’s surface every noon at a wavelength of 10.7 centimetres.
Operating at a wavelength of 2 centimetres, it was used to study galactic and extragalactic objects that emit radio waves, such as quasars.
In 1968, the 46-metre radio telescope was used in conjunction with the 26-metre instrument at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory of Penticton, British Columbia, to simulate the resolution of a giant 3,074-kilometre radio telescope (the physical distance separating the two instruments).
It was the first successful long distance interferometry experiment ever conducted.
The goal of the experiment was to discern a source of radio waves with great precision.
Very large antennas are necessary to precisely determine the position of radio sources because radio waves have much larger wavelengths than visible light waves, and because the detection of any object in space depends largely on the size of the observation instrument (that is, its lenses, mirrors or radio antennas).
The 1970’s marked a time of increased collaboration between the Algonquin Observatory radio astronomers and the researchers at the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Many new complex chemical compounds were identified for the first time in interstellar gas clouds thanks to the collaborative effort.
After planning to resurface the 46-metre radio telescope so that it could operate at wavelengths as small as 3 millimetres, the National Research Council of Canada decided instead to close the Algonquin Observatory in 1987 and purchase a 25% share in the new James-Clerk-Maxwell Observatory, which would include a radio telescope that could operate at 0.3 to 2 millimetres.
In 1990, the work of collecting data on the Sun’s radio flux moved to the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in Penticton, British Columbia.
In 1991, the Algonquin Radio Observatory was finally closed, but the 46-metre antenna is nonetheless still active as part of a continental network of antennas that precisely measures movements of the North American tectonic plate.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory The largest radio astronomy observatory in Canada The Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory was inaugurated in 1960 at White Lake near Penticton, British Columbia.
The creation of the observatory was primarily the work of Carlyle Smith Beals, an astronomer who wanted to advance the field of astrophysics in Canada.
The first parabolic antenna, measuring 25.6 metres, began operating in 1960.
It was mainly designed to operate at a wavelength of 21 centimetres, which corresponds to one of the spectral lines of hydrogen.
Radio astronomers at Penticton have been striving towards this goal since the first days of the observatory.
In 1962, a second radio telescope was put in place.
Fully operational in 1964, it consisted of 1,700 cedar posts that extended for 1.3 kilometres in the shape of a "T" to cover a surface area of 65,000 square metres.
The posts supported a network of several thousand metres of metallic wires formed the antenna of the radio telescope.
This radio telescope was primarily used between 1965 and 1969 during a period when solar spots were at a minimum.
In fact, it is only during these periods of low solar activity that very long radio waves from space can pass through the atmosphere to reach Earth’s surface.
The main goal of the T-shaped radio telescope at Penticton was to produce a map of radio sources in our galaxy.
It was also used to observe several hundred specific radio sources, such as quasars and distant galaxies.
In 1965, a 1.8-metre parabolic antenna was installed to collect data on solar radiation.
In 1968, the 25.6-metre radio telescope at Penticton was used in conjunction with the 46-metre telescope at the Algonquin Radio Observatory to simulate the resolution of a giant radio telescope measuring 3,074 kilometres (the physical distance between the two instruments).
The antennas would operate at a wavelength of 21 centimetres, which corresponds to one of the spectral lines of hydrogen.
Today, the synthesis array radio telescope consists of seven 8.5-metre parabolic antennas that can operate continuously, 24 hours a day, at two wavelengths (21 and 74 centimetres).
From 1995 to 2005, the radio telescope was mainly used in the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey, the goal of which is to map a large portion of the Milky Way.
In 1990, following the closure of the Algonquin Radio Observatory, the task of gathering data on the Sun’s radio flux (the variations in its energy output at radio wavelengths) was transferred to the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory at Penticton.
The observatory is now under the responsibility of the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Rothney Astrophysical Observatory An example of a successful partnership The Rothney Astrophysical Observatory was inaugurated in 1972 at Priddis, a small locality 75 kilometres southwest of Calgary, Alberta.
Belonging to the University of Calgary, the facility was operated by the astronomy and physics departments.
The objectives the observatory were the advanced education of university students and the pursuit of astronomical research.
In 1970, Alexander Rothney Cross, a wealthy rancher, donated land to the University of Calgary for the purpose of constructing the observatory.
Work commenced in 1971 and the university took the opportunity to simultaneously start an undergraduate degree in astronomy.
The observatory opened its doors in 1972 to display a dome housing a 41-centimetre telescope, and an adjacent lecture room.
The first research activities were mostly on photometry.
The year of 1981 was particularly fruitful for the observatory.
The National Research Council of Canada decided to finance the construction of a new facility that would house a 1.5-metre telescope capable of operating in the infrared range.
Alexander Rothney Cross signed on to the project by making another donation.
The Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake also provided a gift: a Baker-Nunn camera that the Armed Forces had used to track satellites in the sky.
The new facility was constructed by the physics department of the University of Calgary.
Construction continued for several years and by 1987 the 1.5-metre telescope was operational.
The physics department changed its name to the Department of Physics and Astronomy.
Most of the research work focused on the study of stars, X-ray sources, possible black holes and planetary nebulas.
The telescope was still equipped with a metal mirror (not glass), and its optical qualities were considered less than optimal by that time.
The decision was made at the end of the 1980’s to replace it with a new 1.8-metre mirror.
The new mirror was delivered to the observatory in 1993, and once again, Alexander Rothney Cross contributed to the project.
Construction was completed by the workshop of the Department of Physics and Astronomy, and the telescope became operational in 1996.
The following year, it was baptized as the Alexander Rothney Cross Telescope in honour of the generous benefactor.
The new telescope is used to observe (among other things) gravitational lenses, asteroids, comets and variable stars, and is also used in the search for planets outside our solar system.
Recent developments include a new Visitor’s Centre that was inaugurated in 2003.
The 41-centimetre telescope continues to be operational and is used to track asteroids that orbit near Earth and represent a possible danger.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Mont-Mégantic Observatory The largest astronomical observatory in eastern North America The Mont-Mégantic Observatory was opened in 1978 near Sherbrooke, Quebec.
It was created to promote university-level astronomy education in Quebec, to provide qualified astronomers with state of the art research equipment, and to promote astronomy among French Canadian citizens.
The telescope is equipped with a 1.6-metre mirror that weights one metric ton; the entire structure weighs 24 tonnes.
The Mont-Mégantic Observatory houses the largest telescope in eastern North America, and the fourth largest in Canada after those of the David Dunlap Observatory in Toronto (1.88 metres), the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria (1.83 metres), and the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory (1.8 metres).
Although not the biggest, the state of the art instruments attached to the Mont-Mégantic telescope make it the most powerful telescope in Canada.
The project to construct a large observatory in Quebec was launched in 1971 by professors Gilles Beaudet and George Michaud of the University of Montreal.
Laval University in Quebec City joined the venture in 1974 and a partnership agreement was signed in 1975.
The federal and provincial governments approved the project in 1976, and construction started the same year.
The service building was completed in 1977, and the observatory several months later in 1978.
René Racine joined the project in 1973 and became Director in 1976, the same year he left the University of Toronto to work at the University of Montreal.
A dynamic instrument program also accounts for a large part of Mégantic’s productivity.
In 1991, for example, the observatory became the first in Canada to use an infrared camera.
Named MONICA (for MONtreal Infrared Camera), it was designed by Daniel Nadeau and René Doyon of the University of Montreal.
The site at Mont-Mégantic is particularly favourable for infrared astronomy because interference radiation levels are very low during the long cold nights in winter (sometimes even lower than the levels at Mauna Kea in Hawaii).
In 1996, the Mont-Mégantic ASTROLab, an astronomy activity centre, opened its doors to the general public.
The centre hosts interactive displays, a high definition movie, multimedia presentations and access to two public observatories during open house astronomy evenings.
Visitors can also tour the observatory and its 1.6-metre telescope during the day.
In 1999, a major 3-year renovation program was started.
First, the dome of the 1.6-metre telescope was repaired and equipped with a ventilation system.
Then, in 2000, the observatory was linked to universities by fibre optics.
A year later, the telescope controls became fully computerized and a new bonnet (the interface that allows instruments to be coupled to the telescope) was installed.
Following this, a number of new state of the art instruments were also added to the telescope.
Asteroid 4843 is named in honour of the observatory.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Canada-France-Hawaii Observatory One of the most powerful and productive observatories in the world The Canada-France-Hawaii Observatory began operating in 1979 atop the Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii.
Canada’s participation meant valuable access to a world-class telescope for Canadian astronomers.
At the time of its inauguration, the 3.6-metre telescope was the sixth largest in the world and operated in the range of visible light and infrared.
France launched the project in 1970 with the purchase of a 14-tonne glass disk.
The state of Hawaii joined the project in 1971, followed by Canada in 1973.
The three partners signed an agreement in 1974 and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Corporation was born.
Canada was in charge of polishing the mirror, putting into place a control system for the telescope, and constructing the observatory building.
France was responsible for constructing specific mechanical parts for the telescope (tube, frame, etc.), and Hawaii provided the site, a road to the site, and several instruments.
The telescope’s mobile component weighed 250 tonnes and the total structure weighed 325 tonnes.
In 1977, the headquarters and a library were set up at Waimea near the observatory.
Canada was granted access to 42.5% of the available observation time, France 42.5%, and the United States 15%.
In 1996, an adaptive optics system was installed on the telescope that would once again rival the Hubble Space Telescope in the production of the highest resolution astronomical images.
These new improvements quickly bore fruit for the Canada-France-Hawaii Observatory as it was involved in discovering – or confirming the discovery of – many new moons, gravitational lenses, and so on.
For example, astronomers Brett J. Gladman and John J. Kavelaars discovered three new satellites around the planet Uranus in 1999 (Prospero, Setebos, and Stephano) and eight around Saturn in 2000 (Siarnaq, Tarvos, Ijrak, Thrymr, Skathi, Mundilfari, Erriapo and Suttungr).
The discoveries of other moons around Uranus and Neptune were announced in 2001 and 2002, but have not yet been confirmed.
In 2003, a new imaging system known as MegaPrime was installed.
MegaPrime uses the French-designed MegaCam camera that is able to take 340-million pixel images (about 18,400 x 18,400 pixels), making it the most powerful camera of its type in the world.
These days, the observatory is involved in the study of the solar system, the birth and evolution of stars, the interstellar medium, the structure and content of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and large-scale structures of the Universe.
The Canadian participation in the observatory is managed by the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The James-Clerk-Maxwell Observatory The largest submillimetre radio telescope in the world The James-Clerk-Maxwell Observatory was inaugurated in 1987 near the summit of Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii.
The observatory is named after James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish physicist who was famous for his groundbreaking work in electricity and magnetism.
At the time of the observatory’s construction, the National Research Council of Canada was planning to resurface its 46-metre radio telescope at the Algonquin Radio Astronomy Observatory.
The goal of the resurfacing program was to increase the resolution of the telescope so that it could observe wavelengths as small as three millimetres.
Upon learning of the capabilities of the new British-Dutch radio telescope, the Council decided instead to close the Algonquin Observatory in 1987and to purchase a 25% share in the James-Clerk-Maxwell Telescope.
The JCMT would suit the needs of Canadian astronomers because it was to operate at wavelengths in the submillimetre to lower microwave range (between 0.3 to 2 millimetres).
Canada currently has access to 22.5% of observation time, the United Kingdom 49.5%, the Netherlands 18%, and the international community 10%.
A piece of Gore-TexTM (the largest in the world) is permanently attached to the building’s opening, which protects the telescope from wind and dust but still allows it to "see" the sky.
Gore-Tex allows 97% of submillimetre waves to pass through and does not interfere with the operation of the radio telescope.
The number one enemy of a radio telescope is water vapour in the Earth’s atmosphere because it easily absorbs submillimetre waves.
To minimize this effect, the observatory is located at an elevation of 4,092 metres: 97% of atmospheric water vapour exists below this elevation and thus below the observatory.
The main use of radio telescopes is to study our solar system (the Sun, planets and comets), interstellar matter, distant galaxies, quasars, and cosmic background radiation.
The government organization responsible for Canadian participation in the radio telescope is the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The University of British-Columbia Liquid-Mirror Observatory Perfecting the next generation of super telescopes The University of British-Columbia Liquid-Mirror Observatory was established in 1995 at Maple Ridge, approximately 60 kilometres east of Vancouver.
The goal of the observatory is to develop and test new liquid mirror telescopes.
Liquid mirror telescopes are part of the next generation of super telescopes.
A liquid mirror is made of a strongly reflective liquid (like mercury, for example) that rotates so that its surface curves and takes the shape of a paraboloid, which will direct and concentrate light to the focal point of a telescope.
This type of mirror has a major advantage over conventional mirrors in that it is much cheaper to build (up to 100 times less expensive).
In 1982, Ermanno Franco Borra, a professor in the Physics Department at Laval University in Quebec, revived the historical proposal of creating liquid mirror telescopes and sought to demonstrate the feasibility of such a project.
Several liquid mirrors were subsequently developed at Laval University in the 1980’s.
In 1994, Paul Hickson of the University of British-Columbia completed the construction of the first liquid mirror telescope in collaboration with Borra.
The mirror measured 2.64 metres in diameter.
The following year, Hickson installed his telescope in the newly inaugurated University of British-Columbia Liquid-Mirror Observatory.
The efforts of Hickson and his collaborators culminated in 2004 when the 6-metre liquid mirror Large Zenith Telescope went into operation.
The Large Zenith Telescope is the third largest optical telescope in North America and the largest liquid mirror telescope in the world.
Despite its enormous size, the mirror components weigh only 3 tonnes.
At the present time, the observatory is involved in two large-scale projects.
The first is the construction of the ALPACA telescope (Advanced Liquid-mirror Probe for Astrophysics, Cosmology and Asteroids), which consists of a liquid mirror measuring 8 metres in diameter.
The array will simulate a telescope measuring 50 metres in diameter.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Gemini North and South Observatory A pair of giant observatories – one in each hemisphere – to provide full sky coverage As the name would suggest, Gemini (which means "twins" in Latin) is the name given to two astronomical observatories.
The locations of these two observatories provide complete access to the sky from both hemispheres.
The idea to construct the two observatories arose in the mid-1980’s.
The venture really got going in 1990 when an agreement was signed between the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.
Observation time is distributed in these same proportions.
Gemini North saw first light in 1999, whereas Gemini South opened a year later in 2000.
The instruments on each telescope, however, are not necessarily the same (cameras, spectrometers, etc.). One of the main contributions made by Canada was to provide an adaptive optics system: a system that corrects image distortion due to turbulence in Earth’s atmosphere.
The construction of the dome, the support, the subterranean facilities and the system that controls the rotating part of each telescope was also Canada’s responsibility.
The system consists of 120 hydraulic jacks under the mirror that provide constant adjustments to restore it to a perfect shape.
The adjustments are typically on the order of one thousandth the width of a human hair.
The observatories were specifically designed to observe visible light, but also infrared light.
Clouds of gas and dust hide large sectors of space, like the regions where stars and planets are forming, or the cores of galaxies that contain quasars and black holes.
Infrared light is of great interest to astronomers because it is able to penetrate these clouds and reveal details that would otherwise be invisible.
The reflecting surface of the Gemini mirrors is made of a thin film of silver that reflects infrared rays better than aluminum, and the domes of the observatories are a metallic grey colour instead of the traditional white to keep the temperature of the telescopes constant.
Moving hatches allow the observing slits to open across the entire dome.
All these finishing touches make the Gemini telescopes expensive instruments to operate.
It currently costs about $50,000 for a single night of observation at one of the telescopes.
Astronomers, however, do not have to spend this amount themselves: user fees for a Gemini telescope are paid by the national agencies that finance the observatory.
Canadian participation in the Gemini telescopes is currently the responsibility of the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics   Video sequence   Jean-René Roy talks about the Gemini telescopes.
The satellite, which weighs 1,360 kilograms, was designed to last three years.
It was the result of a collaborative effort between the United States, Canada and France.
John Hutchings, an astronomer from the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, is Canada’s project scientist.
As the name would suggest, FUSE is an observatory with a mission to study distant sources of ultraviolet radiation, specifically in the range of 9 to 12 millionths of a centimetre.
This portion of the electromagnetic spectrum has been little studied up to this point, mainly because the ozone layer in Earth’s atmosphere absorbs most of the ultraviolet rays that arrive from space.
Ultraviolet light is also particularly difficult to collect.
It becomes increasingly difficult for a mirror to reflect light at very short wavelengths because the waves tend to "slide" between the atoms of the reflecting surface.
X-rays, which are found immediately after ultraviolet rays in the electromagnetic spectrum, have such short wavelengths that they pass right through objects (of course this is also the very property that makes them so useful in medicine).
The FUSE Space Telescope consists of four mirrors specially designed for reflecting ultraviolet light.
Two mirrors are coated with silicon carbide, whereas the other two are coated with lithium fluoride over aluminum.
The FUSE Observatory is 10,000 times more sensitive than the Copernicus satellite (1972-1981), which was the last satellite to observe the sky in ultraviolet light.
The Canadian contribution consists of two fine guidance sensors that allow the space observatory to be aimed at its targets with a very high degree of precision.
This contribution guarantees Canada at least 5% of the available observation time.
The primary mission for FUSE is to analyse the amount of deuterium ("heavy" hydrogen) in the Universe in order to better understand the activity of stars since the Big Bang.
The amount of deuterium has been continually decreasing since the formation of the Universe as the nuclear processes in stars destroy it.
The observatory is also used for other research projects.
In 2000, for example, the telescope was used to discover an explosion involving thousands of stars has left a colossal halo of burning gas the shape of a football extending up to 5,000 to 10,000 light-years above and below the Milky Way.
The observatory is still functioning today, despite numerous setbacks that can be expected given its advanced age.
Video sequence   John Barrie Hutchings explains what FUSE is.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory The only underground Canadian observatory The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory began operating in 1999 at a depth of 2,070 metres below the surface in the Creighton mine near Sudbury, Ontario.
The goal of the observatory is to detect and study neutrinos emitted by the Sun and other celestial objects.
It is the product of a collaborative effort between Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
Neutrinos are small elementary particles that are electrically neutral (that is, they have no electrical charge).
So little, in fact, that matter is virtually transparent to them, and therein lies the difficulty in detecting neutrinos.
Stars produce large amounts of neutrinos.
The Sun, for example, emits 200 trillion trillion trillion neutrinos each second.
Billions of neutrinos pass through the Sun, the Earth and your body every instant without being hindered.
In fact, during your entire lifetime, only one or two neutrinos will ever come into contact with one of the atoms in your body.
One of the major unresolved problems about our Sun is related to its production of neutrinos.
In the early 1980’s, it was realized that the number of solar neutrinos detected by various laboratories were less than predicted by theoretical calculations.
Two hypotheses were proposed: either that our knowledge of the Sun is insufficient, or that some of the neutrinos change their form during their voyage to the Earth (this phenomenon is known to affect other elementary particles), which would mean that the number of neutrinos reaching Earth is less than the amount originally emitted by the Sun.
In 1983, Canadian researchers proposed the construction of an underground neutrino detector in an Ontario nickel mine belonging to the company Inco.
The underground site would shield the detector from microwaves in the background cosmic radiation, which would normally impede the detection of solar neutrinos.
One year later, in 1984, an American researcher published a study that demonstrated the advantages of using heavy water (water in which the hydrogen atoms each have an extra neutron) as a neutrino detector.
Since Canada has an abundant reserve of heavy water, it was decided that the facility would operate as a heavy water detector.
The United States joined the project, follow by the United Kingdom in 1989.
Work began in 1990 and was completed in 1999.
The detector consists of 1,000 tonnes of ultra pure heavy water enclosed in a transparent plastic vessel measuring 12 metres across.
The vessel is itself enclosed in 7,000 tonnes of ultra pure normal water, lodged in an immense cavity measuring 22 metres wide and 34 metres high (the equivalent of a 10-storey building).
It is the largest underground opening ever excavated at two kilometres depth.
The acrylic vessel is surrounded by a 17-metre geodesic dome equipped with 9,600 detectors that sense the presence of neutrinos.
The frequency of neutrino detection is one per hour.
The results from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory have demonstrated that neutrinos do indeed change their form during their trip from the Sun to the Earth, thus putting an end to the debate.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Cosmic Background Imager An observatory for studying the oldest light ever emitted The Cosmic Background Imager was put into service in 2000 at Llano de Chajnantor, a high plateau in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile.
It was the result of collaboration between the United States, Canada and Chile.
The Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics is responsible for Canada’s participation in the observatory.
The goal of the Imager is to make a map of the distribution of cosmic background radiation, microwave radiation that represents the aftermath of the Big Bang, the great explosion that gave birth to the Universe.
The Imager is thus studying the oldest light energy ever emitted.
Mapping the distribution of this ancient light – this ancient radiation – effectively allows researchers to "see" what the Universe looked like very shortly after its birth.
This information is extremely important because it helps them better understand the creation, organization and evolution of large structures in the cosmos, such as galaxy clusters.
The observatory’s telescope operates at wavelengths between 0.83 and 1.15 centimetres, which corresponds to the field of microwaves.
It consists of 13 parabolic antennas mounted on a platform measuring six metres in diameter that can be pointed anywhere in the sky.
Each antenna is 90 centimetres across and is lodged in a protective cylinder sealed with a Teflon cover that can transmit microwaves.
In 2002, the telescope detected a pattern in the distribution of background cosmic radiation that revealed structures much smaller than any observed to date.
Researchers also detected a second pattern that could provide new information about the movement of matter shortly after the Big Bang.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Odin Space Observatory An observatory that specializes in research about water and oxygen The Odin Space Observatory was launched into orbit in 2001.
It is a Swedish satellite that was developed in collaboration with Canada, Finland and France; Canada’s contribution is 20%.
It is the first international satellite in which Canada played a major role in design, construction and operation.
The observatory is named after the Norwegian and Germanic god Odin.
Its mission is twofold: the first objective focuses on aeronomy (the study of the atmosphere), and the second on astronomy.
The aeronomic goal is to study certain molecules that are found in Earth’s atmosphere – such as water, chlorine compounds and ozone – which can help us better understand the processes that cause thinning of the ozone layer.
The goal in terms of astronomy is to detect specific molecules in comets, planets, stars, interstellar clouds and galaxies.
The molecules of greatest interest are water and oxygen, because these cannot be studied from Earth’s surface: our atmosphere blocks any radiation emitted by these molecules in space.
All together the satellite weighs 250 kilograms.
Canada’s role in the project began in 1991 when informal discussions began with Sweden about a possible collaboration between the two countries.
An agreement was signed in 1994 that defined Canada’s role and the venture was launched.
Canada provided several instruments, including OSIRIS, which are used to study specific gases and aerosols in Earth’s atmosphere for the aeronomic part of the mission.
The launch was initially planned for 1997, but after several delays and postponements, it finally took place in 2001.
The predicted life expectancy for the observatory was two years (that is, until 2003), but the satellite is still functioning today.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The MOST Space Telescope The first space telescope entirely of Canadian designed and construction The MOST Space Telescope (which stands for Microvariability and Oscillation of Stars) was launched into space in 2003.
There is a great interest for studying stellar vibrations because they allow scientists to obtain information about the internal structure of a star, and thus about its size, mass and composition.
In 1997, the Canadian Space Agency agreed to finance the project and Jaymie Matthews was named Principal Investigator and Mission Scientist.
About the size and shape of a large suitcase, the satellite weighs only 54 kilograms and is equipped with an ultra high precision telescope that measures only 15 centimetres in diameter.
Despite its diminutive size, it is ten times more sensitive than the Hubble Space Telescope in detecting the minuscule variations in a star’s luminosity caused by vibrations that shake its surface.
The telescope will complete one orbit around the Earth every 101 minutes by passing over each of Earth’s poles.
It will spend 60 days on each star studied.
Its predicted life expectancy is 5 to 10 years.
The first major discovery made by the telescope occurred as soon as it became operational.
The discovery was that Procyon, one of the most studied stars, shows no pulsations at all, which contradicts 20 years of ideas and observations, and forced astronomers to rethink their models for stars.
In 2005, MOST was responsible for another surprising discovery: it observed a giant planet that orbits so close to its host star that the star was forced to synchronize its rotation with that of the planet.
Normally, it is the other way around: a planet synchronizes its orbit with that of its host star.
Video sequence  Jaymie Mark Matthews explains what MOST is.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Atacama Large Millimeter Array What will be the largest submillimetre radio telescope in the world The Atacama Large Millimeter Array will be inaugurated in 2011 at Llano de Chajnantor, a high plateau in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile.
The array should be usable for scientific purposes before its completion, starting in 2007.
The creation of the array is the result of collaboration between Canada, the United States, Europe, Japan and Chile.
The National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics is responsible for Canada’s participation in the radio telescope.
The array consists of 62 parabolic antennas measuring 12 metres across and spread out over 14 kilometres in the desert.
They will operate together to simulate a single radio telescope with a diameter of 14 kilometres.
The antennas will operate at wavelengths between 0.00035 and 10 millimetres: that is, from submillimetre wavelengths to the beginning of the microwave range.
Canada will provide 64 ultra-sensitive receptors for the 3-millimetre wavelength range, as well as the image processing software for the radio telescope.
The Atacama Large Millimeter Array will be used to study the formation of planets, stars, distant galaxies, galaxy clusters and interstellar matter.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The James Webb Space Telescope The successor to the Hubble Space Telescope The James Webb Space Telescope will be launched into space at the beginning of the next decade.
However, it is too far to be repaired and maintained by astronauts, so its life span will only be 5 to 10 years.
The observatory bears the name of James Edwin Webb, director of NASA from 1961 to 1968.
It is the product of a collaborative effort between the United States, Canada and Europe.
John Hutchings, an astronomer with the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, is Canada’s Project Scientist.
At 6.5 metres in diameter, the mirror of the telescope will have a surface seven times greater than that of its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope (2.4-metre mirror).
The mirror will consist of 18 small hexagonal mirrors that will deploy and fit together once the telescope is in orbit.
The entire observatory will weigh 6,600 kilograms.
The telescope will operate at wavelengths between 28 thousandths to 6 millionths of a centimetre: that is, from the mid-range of the infrared to almost the beginning of visible red light (Hubble, in contrast, observes at ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared wavelengths).
This range of wavelengths will make it possible to detect extrasolar planets, to conduct detailed studies into the formation of planets and stars, and to study the oldest galaxies lying at the edges of the Universe.
Canadian researchers are also part of the American and European teams in charge of designing other instruments for the space telescope.

The next generation
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers William Frederick King (1854-1916) He raised Canadian astronomy to international stature William Frederick King was born in 1854 at Stowmarket (Suffolk) in England.
His family immigrated to Canada in 1862 and settled down at Port Hope, Ontario.
In 1875, he obtained his bachelor’s degree with high distinctions from the University of Toronto, and he also earned the university’s gold medal in mathematics.
He spent his free time at the university performing complex mathematical calculations for personal amusement.
Later during his career, the University of Toronto awarded him an honorary doctoral degree for his work in astronomy in 1904.
King published many scientific articles on astronomy.
Without doubt, the most significant was his classic article The Geometry of Orbits in which he described a new method for calculating the orbits of binary stars.
The relative obscurity of his scientific career is more than compensated by his famous achievements as astronomer and administrator for the Canadian Government.
It was under his guidance that astronomy really took off in Canada, developing first at the national scale and then rising to international stature.
King entered the Canadian Government as a land surveyor and topographer in 1872 at the age of 18.
He worked on federal lands in western Canada where his knowledge of astronomy was an asset during mapping as it allowed him to determine the longitudes and latitudes of many locations.
He rose step by step through the government echelons until his nomination as Chief Inspector of Surveys for the Department of the Interior in 1886.
In 1887, King began to pressure the government into creating a federal astronomical observatory.
In 1890, he founded the Astronomy Division of the Department of the Interior with the help of Edward Gaston Daniel Deville and Otto Julius Klotz.
He became its first director that same year and built a small wooden observatory on Cliff Street.
King was nominated seven times as Commissioner of the International Boundary Commission between 1892 and 1908, and he thus helped establish the Canadian-American border.
The world longitude network across the Pacific Ocean was also completed under his direction.
In 1908, he was named Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George for his work.
In 1900, he became founding president of the Ottawa Centre for the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, a position he maintained until his death in 1916.
His efforts to create a large and permanent astronomical observatory bore fruit in 1905 with the inauguration of the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa.
The observatory was equipped with 38-centimetre astronomical telescope and King became its first director.
In 1909, he succeeded where many before him had tried and failed: he founded the Geodetic Survey Division of Canada and became its first director.
Using a variety of methods, including astronomical measurements, the Division managed to precisely determine the position and elevation of many reference points throughout the country, which greatly assisted in the making of geographic maps.
In 1910, only five years after the creation of the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa, King was in charge of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory near Victoria, British Columbia, but died before its inauguration.
In 1911, King was elected President of the Royal Society of Canada, the highest scientific distinction in Canada at the time.
He passed away in Ottawa in 1916 at 62 years old.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers John Stanley Plaskett (1865-1941) He laid the basic foundation for astrophysical research in Canada John Stanley Plaskett was born in 1865 on a farm in Hickson, Ontario.
He began working at the Edison Company (which later become General Electric) in 1886 where he gained experience in mechanics and electricity.
Determined to obtain a university education, he enrolled in the bachelor’s program in 1895 and earned his diploma four years later in 1899 at the age of 33.
Plaskett received four honorary doctoral degrees from Canadian and American universities during his career.
After obtaining his bachelor’s degree, Plaskett taught as a lecturer in the physics department at the University of Toronto.
In 1903, William Frederick King hired him as part of the Astronomy Division of the Department of the Interior to help design and construct instruments for the new Dominion Observatory in Ottawa.
Plaskett became an invaluable addition to the team thanks to his experience in electricity, mechanics and photography.
Plaskett made his first real foray into astronomy in 1905 at the age of 39.
William Frederick King assigned him the responsibility of astrophysical work at the Dominion Observatory.
During his first research project, he was responsible for studying a total eclipse of the Sun that would be visible from Labrador.
In 1907, after working for two years on a new spectroscope of his own design, Plaskett attached it to the telescope of the Dominion Observatory.
He mainly used it to measure the radial velocities of stars (the speed at which the star is moving away or toward the observer), and managed to collect several thousand spectrograms over the following years.
It quickly became evident, however, that the observatory’s 38-centimetre telescope was not efficient enough for the purpose.
In 1910, Plaskett proposed to William Frederick King that a new giant telescope be constructed.
King was enthusiastic about the idea and the two astronomers began pressuring the Canadian Government to make it a reality.
In 1913, Parliament freed up funds and Plaskett worked for the next five years on the design of a 1.83-metre telescope – the biggest in the world – for the new Dominion Astrophysical Observatory to be built in Victoria, British Columbia.
The new observatory was inaugurated in 1918.
Plaskett continued his work on the radial velocities of stars.
In 1922, he discovered a binary star and the larger of the two still holds the record as the most massive known binary star; it is known today as "Plaskett’s Star".
Between 1928 and 1935, Plaskett published a series of articles with Joseph Algernon Pearce on the radial velocities of stars and confirmed that our galaxy, the Milky Way, rotates.
In fact, he was the first to measure the size, mass and rotational speed of the Milky Way.
He also established that the Sun is located at 2/3 of the distance from the centre of our galaxy, and that our solar system takes approximately 220 million years to complete one galaxial rotation.
He took his retirement in 1935 and died in 1941 in Esquimalt, British Columbia at the age of 75.
In 1988, the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada and the Canadian Astronomical Society created the Plaskett Medal, awarded each year to the author of the best doctoral thesis in astronomy or astrophysics at a Canadian university.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Clarence Augustus Chant (1865-1956) The Father  of Canadian astronomy Clarence Augustus Chant was born in 1865 at Hagerman’s Corners, Ontario.
He finished high school in 1884 and taught for three years at a school.
He enrolled at the University of Toronto in 1887 and received his bachelor’s degree in 1890.
He secured a job with the Department of Finance in Ottawa, but only stayed for two years.
Chant was determined to obtain a university post, and in 1892, he was hired as a lecturer for the physics department at the University of Toronto.
In 1898, he spent the summer in Germany to study the theory of light, and in 1900 he received his Master’s degree while continuing his role as lecturer.
He left Toronto for Harvard University in the United States and returned the following year, doctoral degree in hand.
His interest for astronomy began in 1892 when he was hired by the physics department of the University of Toronto.
He joined the Physics and Astronomy Society of Toronto, which changed its name to the Astronomical Society of Toronto in 1900, and again to the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in 1902.
Chant acted as President from 1904 to 1907.
In 1904, Chant suggested that the University of Toronto increase the number of astronomy courses offered by the physics department.
His proposal was well received and six courses were added to the program in 1905.
Until a second professor was hired in 1926, Chant was the sole Canadian professor to train professional astronomers.
It was his role of having taught virtually all the original Canadian astronomers that earned Chant his reputation as the "Father  of Canadian astronomy".
No less than five of his former students went on to become directors of astronomical observatories.
In 1906, the lack of a large telescope in the Toronto region prompted Chant to campaign for an astronomical observatory that would be the property of the University of Toronto or the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
Meanwhile, in the absence of a suitable telescope, he focused his research on total solar eclipses.
The astronomy department of the University of Toronto was officially established in 1920 and Chant became its first chairman.
The physics department consequently ceased to offer astronomy courses.
In 1921, Chant met David Dunlap, a lawyer and mining entrepreneur, and got him interested in the idea of building a large telescope observatory for the Toronto region.
Unfortunately, Dunlap died in 1924 and seemingly with him any chance of realizing Chant’s goal.
Chant led an expedition to Australia in 1922 to observe a total eclipse of the sun and to verify Einstein’s theory of relativity concerning the deflection of light by a body as massive as a star.
It proved to be one of the first verifications of Einstein’s theory.
In 1928, Chant published Our Wonderful Universe with enormous success, and the book was translated into five languages.
In 1935, the David Dunlap Observatory of the University of Toronto was inaugurated on the same day that Chant celebrated his 70th birthday, received an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Toronto, and took his retirement.
At the time of its inauguration, the observatory housed the second largest telescope in the world, measuring 1.88 metres across.
Chant died in 1956 in Richmond Hill, Ontario, at the age of 91.
He published many scientific books and articles, and received numerous awards.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Carlyle Smith Beals (1899-1979) He expanded and developed astrophysics and geophysics in Canada Carlyle Smith Beals was born in 1899 at Canso, Nova Scotia.
He enrolled instead at the University of Toronto and obtained his Master’s degree in 1923.
Beals then returned to the University of Acadia where he was hired as assistant professor in physics.
He only stayed for one year before accepting a job in 1927 at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia.
He stayed at the observatory considerably longer: 20 years, in fact.
Shortly after his arrival, he began to perfect or invent new instruments for the observatory’s telescope.
He established a reliable temperature scale for very hot stars and was the first to demonstrate that their emission spectra are proof that they are surrounded by large gaseous envelopes.
He wrote a thesis on the subject and received a second doctoral degree from the University of London in 1934.
Beals also discovered that the wide emission lines from Wolf-Rayet and P Cygni-type stars are the result of gaseous material ejecting from their surfaces.
He was also the first to recognize that the gas in interstellar space is not uniformly distributed and that it is locally concentrated into clouds that move at high speeds.
In 1940, he became Adjoint Director of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory of Victoria.
Beals attracted many young researchers to Ottawa, improved the institution’s seismological, gravimetric, magnetic and solar facilities, modernized its official time distribution service, installed new telescopes in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, installed cameras to observe meteors in Alberta, and established the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in Penticton, British Columbia.
In 1956, he began publishing geophysical studies on terrestrial and lunar impact craters, and in so doing demonstrated that meteorite bombardment played a major role in the formation of the planets, including Earth.
Beals retired in 1964 and died in 1979 in Ottawa at the age of 80.
He received many awards for his work in astronomy, geophysics and administration, including the Order of Canada.
Asteroid 3314 and a lunar crater were named in his honour.
In 1981, the Astronomical Society of Canada created the Carlyle S. Beals Award, given every two years to a Canadian astronomer, or an astronomer working in Canada, in recognition of their outstanding achievement in research.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Gerhard Herzberg (1904-1999) He helped make the National Research Council of Canada a world-renowned centre of excellence Gerhard Herzberg was born in 1904 at Hamburg, Germany.
During the early 1920’s, he decided to follow a career in astronomy but was quickly dissuaded by the scarcity of jobs in the field.
He enrolled at the Darmstadt Institute of Technology in 1924 where he obtained a bachelor’s degree in 1927 and a doctoral degree in physical engineering in 1928.
Specializing in atomic and molecular physics, he completed his first postdoctoral position at the University of Göttingen in 1928 and a second postdoctoral assignment at the University of Bristol in 1929.
In 1930, he was hired as a lecturer and assistant to the head of the physics department at the Darmstadt Institute of Technology.
He built a large spectroscopic laboratory and supervised the research of several students and guest researchers.
The German authorities would only allow him to leave with about $2.50, and he sought refuge in Canada where he was offered a guest professorship at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon.
Three months later, he became professor in the physics department, a position he occupied for the next six years.
His work focused mainly on molecular spectroscopy; that is, on the analysis of molecular structure.
More specifically, Herzberg concentrated on the detection and the nature of free radicals.
Free radicals are intermediary molecules in chemical reactions that only exist for several millionths of a second in the laboratory, but much longer in space.
One of his first accomplishments at Saskatoon was to identify the CH+ molecule in interstellar clouds (clouds of gas found between stars).
At the time, only two other molecules had been identified in such an environment.
In addition to the numerous scientific articles that he wrote, he also published three books (1936, 1939 and 1945) that quickly became classics in atomic and molecular spectroscopy.
In 1945, the Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago offered Herzberg a position as professor of spectroscopy at their extensive state-of-the-art facilities.
He studied comets and planetary atmospheres by perfecting methods that would go on to become standard techniques used around the world.
In 1948, he returned to Canada and was named Principal Research Officer at the National Research Council, and Director of the Division of Physics shortly afterwards.
He soon began to assemble a group of talented spectroscopists with specialities in various portions of the electromagnetic spectrum (microwaves, infrared, visible light and ultraviolet light), and created research teams in the fields of theoretical and solid state physics.
Herzberg continued to add to his major scientific discoveries: he was the first to detect the hydrogen molecule in planetary atmospheres, the first to uncover the presence of water in comets, and the first to identify dozens of free radicals (including methylene CH2 and methyl CH3) in the laboratory and interstellar clouds.
He also established the National Research Council of Canada as a world leader in molecular spectroscopy.
In 1966, 1971 and 1979, he published three other books that each became a classic in molecular spectroscopy.
In 1969, the National Research Council of Canada created the post of Distinguished Research Scientist for him, which he occupied until his retirement.
In 1974, the Council combined its astronomy and spectroscopy units and created the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, where he worked until his retirement in 1995.
Herzberg died in Ottawa in 1999 at 94 years old.
He had received numerous distinctions, including the 1971 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
Asteroid 3316 was named in his honour.
In 2004, the National Research Council of Canada created its highest honour, the Herzberg Medal, to bestow upon a scientist whose research contributions are characterized by both excellence and influence.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Helen Sawyer Hogg (1905-1993) A world expert in galaxy clusters and variable stars, she inspired many women to enter science and helped popularize astronomy in Canada Helen Sawyer was born in 1905 at Lowell, Massachusetts.
In 1922, she enrolled at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, and obtained her bachelor’s degree in 1926.
She then received her master’s degree in 1928 and her doctoral degree in 1931, both from Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Her research topic was the study of variable starts in globular clusters, and she would work on this type of star for the rest of her life.
In 1930, she married Frank Hogg, a young Canadian and fellow astronomy student.
In 1931, they moved to Canada where Frank accepted a post at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia.
Unfortunately, the depression had hit and Helen was unable to find work.
She nonetheless obtained permission to use the observatory’s telescope and was able to pursue her study of globular masses on a volunteer basis.
In 1935, Helen and Frank relocated to Ontario where Frank took a professorship with the astronomy department at the University of Toronto.
Helen pursued her observations of globular clusters at the David Dunlap Observatory, and she was hired as a research officer in the astronomy department in 1936.
Two years later, in 1941, she started teaching at the astronomy department of the University of Toronto.
In 1946, Helen’s husband Frank became Director of the David Dunlap Observatory, a position he would occupy until his death in 1951.
In 1957, Hogg became adjunct full professor in the astronomy department of the University of Toronto.
She continued her work on variable stars, which numbered more than 2,000 by the end of her career.
The parameters she measured during her research provided a basis for estimating the age of our galaxy and for improving our understanding of its evolution.
In 1970, Hogg hosted her own television show on astronomy.
In 1971, she founded the Astronomical Society of Canada and became its first president.
She retired in 1976, was named Professor Emeritus, and wrote a popular guide to astronomy titled The Stars Belong to Everyone.
Helen Sawyer Hogg died in Toronto at the age of 92.
She had received numerous distinctions for her work in astronomy and for her efforts to popularize the science, including the Order of Canada.
Asteroid 2917 was named in her honour.
In 1985, the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada and the Astronomical Society of Canada created the Helen Sawyer Hogg Public Lecture.
The lecture, given each year by an invited speaker during the annual meeting of the two societies, commemorates her contributions to public appreciation of the universe.
The Canadian National Museum of Science and Technology's observatory in Ottawa is named for her.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Andrew McKellar (1910-1960) Known around the world as one of Canada’s best astronomers, he was the first to measure the temperature of the Universe Andrew McKellar was born in 1910 in Vancouver, British Columbia.
In 1930, he received his bachelor’s degree from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and then enrolled at the University of California in Berkeley where he obtained his master’s degree in 1932 and his doctoral degree in 1933.
He specialized in molecular spectroscopy; that is, in the detection and analysis of molecular structure.
In 1933, he became a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.
It was there that he made his first forays into astronomy by studying the Sun.
In 1935, he accepted a position at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia.
He began measuring the orbits of binary stars and pursued his own research into molecular spectroscopy.
World War II erupted in 1939 and McKellar became a research officer for the Royal Canadian Navy.
He attained the rank of lieutenant commander, all the while pursuing his astronomy work and publishing several significant scientific articles.
In 1940, he began using spectroscopy to determine the composition of comets and demonstrated that solar rays modify their spectra.
Also in 1940, he was the first to detect the presence of matter in interstellar space when he identified the spectrum of the organic compounds cyanogen ("CN") and methyne ("CH").
In 1978, with McKellar having passed away almost twenty years earlier, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Penzias and Wilson for their part in the discovery that launched the Big Bang hypothesis to the forefront of cosmological theories.
When World War II ended in 1945, McKellar reclaimed his position as researcher at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria and remained there until his death in 1960.
In 1948, he was the first to provide proof of the existence of the carbon-nitrogen cycle ("CN cycle") within cold carbon stars.
The CN cycle, which had been predicted 10 years earlier, is a chain of thermonuclear reactions in which carbon and nitrogen combine to release enormous amounts of energy.
According to the theory, it is this energy that sustains cold carbon stars.
During the 1950’s, McKellar became increasingly interested in giant cold stars (those with surface temperatures as low as 2,000° C) and broadened our knowledge about their size and chemical composition.
Among other contributions, he demonstrated that large turbulent movements could agitate their atmospheres.
Succumbing to an incurable disease, he died in 1960 in Victoria, British Columbia, at the young age of 50.
He had completed a full day of work at the observatory just four days before he passed away.
McKellar received many awards for his work in astronomy, including being elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
In 1962, the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria named their 1.2-metre telescope in his honour.
The telescope is used to measure the speed of stars and to determine their chemical compositions.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Arthur Edwin Covington (1913-2001) As Canada’s first radio astronomer, he collected data on solar activity every day for more than thirty years; his work constitutes the world’s best database in the field Arthur Edwin Covington was born in 1913 in Regina, Saskatchewan.
In 1938, he received his bachelor’s degree from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and obtained his master’s degree from the same institution in 1940.
That same year, he enrolled at the University of California in Berkeley where, two years later in 1942, he received his doctoral degree in nuclear physics.
At that point, he moved to Ottawa, Ontario, and participated in the war effort by helping develop new radar systems at the National Research Council of Canada.
After the war, Covington proposed a research project that would convert surplus radar equipment into instruments that could study cosmic radiation.
His proposal was accepted in 1946 and he began constructing the first Canadian radio telescope.
Once the equipment had been calibrated, he decided to measure the radiation emanating from the Sun, or more specifically, it’s "radio flux": the variations in its energy output at radio wavelengths.
He began collecting data in July of 1946 and quickly realized that the flux changed from day to day.
Unable to determine whether these daily variations were related to problems with the instruments or to the presence of dark spots ("sunspots") found on the Sun’s surface, he decided to use a partial solar eclipse on November 23, 1946, to his advantage: he would monitor any variations in the radio flux as sunspots became covered by the Moon.
Much to his surprise, he determined that the dimmer regions of the Sun – those marked by sunspots – emit much stronger radiation than the more luminous unmarked areas.
He thus provided the first direct evidence that sunspots are associated with radiation "hot spots".
Encouraged by this discovery, Covington began collecting daily data on the Sun’s radio flux in 1947, and succeeded in demonstrating that the number of sunspots is related to the Sun’s radiation flux.
He collected data on a continuous basis from that point forward and his measurements were used around the world.
In 1951, he constructed a device that would detect the radiation emitted by specific regions on the Sun’s surface.
He thus managed to measure the brilliance of the Sun’s corona (the uppermost level of the Sun’s atmosphere) and the temperature of the regions above sunspots (about 1,500,000 °C).
His work would greatly contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that create sunspots.
Covington succeeded in demonstrating that the intensity of solar radiation is related to the magnetic activity of the Sun, which has crucial implications for numerous human activities, such as communications systems, power lines, climate predictions, agriculture, fishing, space exploration, manmade satellites, geophysics, etc.
In 1959, the Algonquin Radio Observatory was established in Ontario and Covington became its director.
He took his retirement in 1978 and died in 2001 in Kingston, Ontario, at 88 years old.
One of the buildings at the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics in Penticton was named in his honour in 2003.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Anne Barbara Underhill (1920-2003) A pioneer in the field of hot blue stars, she perfected sophisticated calculation techniques to better understand their atmospheres Anne Barbara Underhill was born in 1920 in Vancouver, British Columbia.
She obtained her bachelor’s degree in 1942 and her master’s degree in 1944 from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
In 1948, Underhill completed postdoctoral work at the Copenhagen Observatory in Denmark, and then joined the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia, where she stayed until 1962.
Underhill specialized in the study of "early-type stars" or "OB stars"; that is, very hot blue stars.
Newly discovered and poorly understood at the time, these stars were surrounded by very thick atmospheres.
Underhill collected a lot of data on OB stars at Victoria but quickly realized that no existing mathematical model could interpret her data.
Not one to give up, Underhill took it upon herself to develop and perfect the mathematical equations required to model the atmospheres of OB stars.
She began in the 1950’s, an era in which the only available computers were mechanical devices that had to be manually operated; it was an arduous task due to the enormous amount of time required to complete each calculation.
In 1962, Underhill became a professor of stellar astrophysics at Utrecht University in the Netherlands where she pursued her work on OB stars.
In 1966, she wrote The Early Type Stars, a book that quickly became a standard reference for OB stars.
In 1970, Underhill became the director of the new optical astronomy laboratory at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center at Greenbelt, Maryland.
She contributed to the development of the International Ultraviolet Explorer Satellite until 1977, at which point she returned to her work on OB stars.
It was in the 1970’s that Underhill became convinced that Wolf-Rayet type stars are young, not old (an idea that we now know to be incorrect), and she retained this conviction for the rest of her life.
Wolf-Rayet stars release colossal quantities of matter into space.
She retired in 1985 and returned to Canada as Professor Emeritus at the University of British Columbia in Victoria.
She died in Vancouver at the age of 83.
She received numerous awards for her work in astronomy and was elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Sidney van den Bergh (1929- ) A world expert in galaxy classification and the measurement of cosmic distances, he made several estimates of the size and age of the Universe Sidney van den Berg was born in 1929 in Wassenaar, Netherlands.
He spent one year at the University of Leiden and then went to Princeton University in the United States on a scholarship.
He received his bachelor’s degree from Princeton in 1950, and his master’s from Ohio State University in 1952.
He finished his studies in 1956 with a doctoral degree from the University of Göttingen in Germany.
He was hired as a professor at Ohio State University the same year he graduated, and he stayed there until 1958 when he accepted a professorship at the David Dunlap Observatory of the University of Toronto in Ontario.
He became involved in expanding the observatory’s facilities, perfecting computerized calculation techniques, and developing the field of polychrome photometry.
Van den Bergh’s main specialty was the study of meteors, but his interests quickly diversified and by 1960 he had already published numerous articles on globular clusters, interstellar clouds, galaxies and supernovae.
Four years later, he became President and Chairman of the Board of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Corporation.
He retired in 1986, but retained a researcher position at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria.
Today, van den Bergh focuses his research on the classification and the evolution of galaxies using images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.
He retains an interest in a number of diverse subjects: among others, he published an article in 1992 that refuted the idea of an astronomical significance for the Nazca lines of Peru, and one in 1994 demonstrating that it is unlikely supernova explosions caused mass extinctions on Earth.
Van den Bergh has published more than 500 scientific articles.
He received numerous awards for his work and was named an Officer of the Order of Canada.
Asteroid 4230 bears his name in his honour.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Hubert Reeves (1932- ) A specialist in the origin of light elements and a highly talented popularizer of astronomy, he is often called "the poet of the stars" Hubert Reeves was born in 1932 in Montreal, Quebec.
He received his bachelor’s degree from the University of Montreal in 1953, his master’s from McGill University in Montreal in 1955, and his doctoral degree from Cornell University in New York in 1960.
In 1965, he became the Director of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique ("National Science Research Centre") in Paris and a scientific consultant for the Commissariat à l’énergie atomique ("Nuclear Energy Commission") in Saclay, France.
A specialist in astrophysics, Reeves studies the thermonuclear reactions that occur in stars; that is, the reactions that create the chemical elements that make up matter.
Since 1962, his work has focused on nuclear reactions involving carbon and oxygen.
He also focuses part of his research on neutrinos, a type of subatomic particle that we still know very little about.
In 1967, he became increasingly interested in the origin of the light elements lithium, beryllium and boron.
The very high temperatures that occur inside stars would destroy these three elements, so they must form elsewhere, namely out in space.
In 1968, he published Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis, and in 1972 he wrote Nuclear Reactions in Stellar Surfaces and their Relations with Stellar Evolution.
These were the only two publications, among his many books, that were written for specialists in the field.
In 1971, Reeves helped demonstrate, along with other colleagues, that a process known as "spallation" creates lithium, beryllium and boron.
During this process, the atomic nuclei of relatively heavy elements, like oxygen, "break" under the impact of cosmic rays (particles that travel at high speed through space).
Some of the "pieces" created by these collisions are lithium, beryllium or boron atoms.
In 1972, Reeves collaborated with Johannes Geiss to explain the origin of two other light elements: deuterium and helium-3.
The test for their hypothesis was made possible by experiments conducted during the Apollo moon missions, and the results also allowed them to estimate the density of normal matter in the Universe.
In 1977, Reeves published Soleil ("Sun"), his first popular science book.
Four years later, in 1981, he wrote another, Patience dans l’azur ("Patience in the Sky"), about the different steps in the formation of the Universe that gained immediate international acclaim.
Another 15 or so popular astronomy books were published in the years to follow, some with co-authors.
The beginning of the 1980’s marked a time of increasing popularity for Reeves as he gave many public lectures and appeared on television shows and in films, speaking not just on the topic of astronomy, but also the environment.
Reeves received many awards and distinctions for his work in astronomy and public communications.
In 2001, he and Johannes Geiss received the Einstein prize for their work on the density of the Universe.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers René Racine (1939- ) As an inventor of exceptional astronomical instruments, he played a key role in the creation of the Mont-Mégantic Observatory René Racine was born in 1939 in Quebec City.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree from Laval University in Quebec City in 1963, and went on to the University of Toronto where he received his master’s degree in 1965 and his doctoral degree in 1967.
He then obtained a research scholarship at the Carnegie Institute and spent the next two years (1967-1969) at the Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories near Pasadena, California.
Racine specializes in the study of globular clusters.
Globular clusters are collections of stars that form a spherical shape containing anywhere from 10,000 to millions of stars.
Racine studies them using photometry, a technique that measures the intensity of light emitted from an object, which can be used to extract information about its size, temperature, etc.
In 1969, he became a professor in the astronomy and astrophysics department of the University of Toronto.
Upon his arrival, Racine teamed up with colleagues Sidney van den Bergh and Robert F. Garrison to propose that the new observatory for the university be built at Las Campanas in Chile.
The 60-centimetre telescope saw first light in 1971, and Racine equipped it with a new photometer of his own design.
In 1976, he became astronomy professor for the physics department at the University of Montreal.
Racine played a key role in the creation of the new Mont-Mégantic Observatory and was its director from 1976 to 1980.
In 1980, he was named Executive Director of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Corporation (CFWT).
He worked on improving the image quality of the telescope and succeeded in producing the highest resolution images in the world, all the while pursuing his work in astronomical research.
In 1984, he left his post as Director of the CFWT and returned as Director of the Mont-Mégantic Observatory.
In 1997, he retired from his positions as Adjunct Full Professor and Director of the Mont-Mégantic Observatory, and became Professor Emeritus at the University of Montreal.
Racine was elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada in 1989 and the Order of Canada in 1999.
In 2005, he was made an Officer of the Ordre national du Québec (National Order of Quebec).
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers John Barrie Hutchings (1941- ) He was the first to discover a black hole outside our galaxy John Barrie Hutchings was born in 1941 in Johannesburg, South Africa.
He received his bachelor’s degree in 1962, his bachelor’s with Honours in 1963, and his master’s in 1964 from the Rand University of South Africa.
He then obtained his doctoral degree from the University of Cambridge in England in 1967.
From 1967 to 1969, he took a position as a postdoctoral researcher at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia, and he remains there as a researcher to this day.
Hutchings specializes in the atmospheres of OB stars (very hot blue stars).
In 1968, he discovered that these stars, which have very thick atmospheres, generate hot stellar winds.
In 1983, after ten years of research on binary stars, he made a major discovery:
Hutchings, along with coworkers Anne Cowley and David Crampton, identified the first black hole located outside our galaxy.
Not even one year later, in 1984, he made a second remarkable discovery by proving, along with David Crampton and Bruce Campbell, that quasars are the centres of active galaxies.
Active galaxies are those with centres marked by enormous energy outputs.
Over the years, the study of quasars became one of Hutchings specialties.
In 1987, he became part of the FUSE satellite science team as Canada’s Project Scientist (FUSE stands for "Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer").
In 1994, Hutchings became Chairman of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
In 1997, thanks to a newly installed spectrograph on the HST, he and some of his collaborators were the first to observe plumes of matter emitted from the centres of active galaxies.
In 1998, he was named Canadian Principal Investigator for the proposed CUVIT space mission (Canadian UV Imaging Telescope).
In 2000, Hutchings became Canada’s Principal Investigator for ASTROSAT, a satellite launched by the Indian Space Research Organization to study galactic objects and distant extra-galactic objects.
Hutchings has published more than 400 scientific articles to date.
He received numerous distinctions for his work, including his election as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Charles Thomas Bolton (1943- ) He was the first to discover a black hole Charles Thomas Bolton was born in 1943 at Camp Forrest, a World War II military base in Tennessee, United States.
He received his bachelor’s degree in 1966 from the University of Illinois and his master’s (1968) and doctoral degrees (1970) from the University of Michigan.
From 1970 to 1972, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the David Dunlap Observatory of the University of Toronto astronomy department.
He also taught at the David Dunlap Observatory from 1970 to 1972, at Scarborough College from 1971 to 1972, and at Erindale College from 1972 to 1973.
He then became a professor in the astronomy department at the University of Toronto in 1973, and has remained there ever since.
In 1970, Bolton was the first to develop a computer model for stellar atmospheres that was able to generate large regions of the modeled spectrum with enough precision to allow comparison with the spectra from real stars.
In 1972, Bolton made a discovery in astronomy that was so important it guaranteed him a place in the history books: he was the first astronomer to present irrefutable evidence of the existence of a black hole.
The black hole in question was Cygnus X-1, which lies at the centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way.
Bolton detected its presence by observing star HDE 226868 wobble as if it was orbiting around an invisible but massive companion.
His calculations demonstrated that the companion could be nothing less than a black hole.
A black hole is a celestial body that is so massive and dense that nothing can escape its gravitational pull (its attractive force), not even light.
The name arises from the fact that it cannot emit light and thus appears black, and it traps all that falls into it, like a hole in space.
In 1978, Bolton demonstrated that the nitrogen anomalies observed in the spectra of OBN stars are due to the transfer of material to a nearby neighbouring star.
OB stars are very hot blue stars with thick atmospheres.
OBN stars are a subclass of OB stars that are characterized by nitrogen anomalies in their spectra.
In 1981, he suggested that the ejections of material from Be-type stars – a subclass of B stars – are caused by non-radial pulsations (vibrations that shake Be stars in an irregular manner).
Bolton established a Canadian first in the 1990’s when he wrote a bylaw to regulate light pollution that was adopted by the town of Richmond Hill, Ontario, in 1994.
Bolton has received many awards for his work, including being elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Jean-René Roy (1943- ) Astrophysicist and current Director of the Gemini Astronomical Observatory, which owns two of the biggest telescopes in the world Jean-René Roy was born in 1943 in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec.
He received his bachelor’s degree from the University of Montreal in Quebec in 1969 before moving to the University of Western Ontario in London where he obtained his master’s and doctoral degrees in 1971 and 1973.
In 1977, he organized a workshop on the causes of the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction that marked the disappearance of the dinosaurs.
That same year, Roy became an astronomy professor in the physics department at Laval University in Quebec City and later contributed to the creation of the Mont-Mégantic Observatory, which was inaugurated in 1978.
In 1982, Roy published his first book, L’astronomie et son histoire ("Astronomy and its History").
That same year, he and his colleagues, Yvon Georgelin and Jacques Boulesteix, designed a new Fabry-Perot interferometer for the Mont-Mégantic Observatory.
Other instruments were to follow.
In 1997, he became a member of the board of directors for the Gemini Project, a proposal to construct the two largest telescopes in the world.
One of the telescopes would be located in the northern hemisphere (Hawaii) and the other in the southern hemisphere (Chile).
In 2000, he left Laval University to become the scientific director for the Gemini North Observatory in Hawaii.
His current research interests are spiral galaxies, the processes of massive star formation, and the chemical enrichment in galaxies.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Peter Gordon Martin (1947- ) A specialist in the study of interstellar matter, he was involved in numerous international research projects Peter Gordon Martin was born in 1947 at Owen Sound  in Ontario.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree from the University of Toronto in 1968 and his master’s degree in 1969.
Three years later, in 1972, he received his doctoral degree from the University of Cambridge in England, and then returned to the University of Toronto to take a post as professor.
He strives to understand its origin and its relationship to stars.
To do this, he analyzes and interprets data gathered by telescopes on Earth and in space, and integrates these data into theoretical computer simulations.
During the first 15 years of his career, Martin concentrated mainly on interstellar dust.
Subjected to the magnetic fields produced by various celestial objects, interstellar dust tends to align itself in space like a magnet.
Any light passing through these particles likewise become aligned (the light becomes "polarized"), and by studying this light, it becomes possible to extract information about the composition and shape of the interstellar grains.
In 1984, Martin became the first person from the astronomy department at the University of Toronto to become a member of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.
Not long after, in 1987, he became interested in the collisions affecting hydrogen molecules of interstellar gas clouds where stars are born.
His contributions in this field have repercussions for our understanding of how the first stars of the Universe came to be.
Martin used the Orion nebula as a case study in 1991 to examine the conditions within nebulas and other regions where interstellar matter is concentrated.
The results of these studies have improved our understanding of the evolution of galaxies in the Universe.
In 1995, he became a permanent member of the science committee that manages the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey, a project that aims to map a large portion (60 degrees) of our galaxial plane at several different wavelengths using a common resolution.
Martin uses the collected data to study the formation of massive stars and the evolution of interstellar dust, as well as its influence on the ecology of our galaxy.
In 1999, Martin was named Director of the University of Toronto’s David Dunlap Observatory.
He is currently involved in a number of international research projects, including the James Webb Space Telescope (the successor of the Hubble Space Telescope), the Herschel Space Observatory, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Planck space mission.
Martin received the Carlyle S. Beals Award in 1994 from the Astronomical Society of Canada in recognition of his research contributions.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Gilles Fontaine (1948- ) An asteroseismologist and world specialist in white dwarf stars Gilles Fontaine was born in 1948 at Lévis, near Quebec City.
In 1969, he obtained his bachelor’s degree from Laval University in Quebec City, and his doctoral degree in 1974 from the University of Rochester in the state of New York.
He then took a postdoctoral position at the University of Western Ontario in London, and in 1977 he became a professor at the University of Montreal.
Fontaine has specialized in the study of white dwarf stars since he first started his doctoral studies.
A white dwarf forms when a star depletes its nuclear fuel.
Asteroseismologists – scientist who study the vibrations of stars – can measure these changes in intensity with an instrument known as a photometer.
There is a great interest for studying stellar vibrations because they allow scientists to obtain information about the internal structure of a star, and thus about its size, mass and composition.
It is analogous to seismology, in which geophysicists study earthquakes as a means to probe the internal structure of the Earth.
In 1982, only one year after forming, the team used mathematical models to predict the existence of a new type of pulsating star: the DB-type white dwarf.
That same year, their prediction was confirmed by telescopic observations of a DB white dwarf.
It was a first in astrophysics because, up to that point, new star types were discovered before being theoretically predicted.
In 1987, Fontaine and his collaborators had the idea to determine the age of the Universe using white dwarfs.
Since white dwarfs are very old stars nearing the end of their life, to determine their age would effectively estimate the age of the galaxy and – in the bigger picture – that of the Universe.
In order to accomplish this goal, Fontaine designed numerical simulation models that weighted several parameters for a given star – such as mass, temperature and luminosity – and calculated the time that it would take for the white dwarf to cool.
In 1990, Fontaine published the first results within the framework of the Montréal-Cambridge-Tololo Project, which he helped develop.
The main goal of the project was the systematic exploration of white dwarfs in the southern hemisphere.
In 1996, Fontaine and his team once again theoretically predicted the existence of a new type of star, a B-type white subdwarf, and astronomers once again confirmed its existence, this time at the South African Astronomical Observatory in 1997.
In the years since, Fontaine and his collaborators have continued to predict other types of stars.
Fontaine received numerous distinctions for his work, including being elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Asteroid 4230 is named in his honour.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers John Richard Bond (1950- ) World expert in theoretical astrophysics and cosmology, he made Canada a leader in cosmology John Richard Bond was born in 1950 in Toronto.
In 1973, he obtained his bachelor’s degree from the University of Toronto and enrolled at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1974.
He became a member of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and helped establish the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.
Bond specializes in the study of the structure of the Universe.
During the 1980’s, very few researchers believed that it would be possible to detect variations in the cosmic background radiation due to its incredibly old age of 14 billion years.
However, in 1991, the COBE satellite (COsmic Background Explorer) did indeed reveal slight variations.
Encouraged by these results, Bond continued to develop many sophisticated mathematical tools during the 1990’s in order to study these variations.
He published many significant articles that established new rigorous standards in various disciplines or created entirely new research domains.
Bond’s studies were so numerous between 1981 and 1997 that he was the most cited Canadian astronomer in specialized journals during that time (more than 3,000 citations).
In 1996, he was named Director of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.
In 1998, the first Boomerang mission was launched above the Antarctic.
It consisted of a balloon that carried a 1.20-metre telescope (named Boomerang) to an altitude of 35 kilometres to avoid the terrestrial atmosphere that would interfere with its instruments.
In 2000, Bond and several colleagues used the Boomerang results to demonstrate that the Universe has a planar geometry and to confirm that it is expanding.
In 2001, Bond became director of research programs at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.
Today, he tries to understand the cause of the accelerated expansion of the Universe, which is to understand the very nature of dark energy that Einstein first introduced in his theories as "the cosmological constant".
It is proposed that dark energy is a repulsive force that counterbalances and may exceed the braking force of gravity; it is the force that attempts to push the expansion of the Universe to infinity.
According to Bond, it is possible that some small trace – some evidence – of the existence of dark energy could be found in the cosmic background radiation.
Bond received (and continues to receive) numerous national and international awards for his work, including being elected as a member to the Royal Society of Canada.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Scott Duncan Tremaine (1950- ) As a world expert in cosmic dynamics, he made several predictions that were subsequently confirmed by observation Scott Duncan Tremaine was born in 1950 in Toronto.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree from McMaster’s University in 1971, and his master’s and doctoral degrees in 1973 and 1975 respectively from the University of Princeton in the United States.
Upon obtaining his doctoral degree, he was hired as a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
He stayed for two years and then moved to England in 1977 to become a research agent in the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge.
One year later, he returned to the United States to be a researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University in New Jersey.
Tremaine is an expert in cosmic dynamics; that is, the study of the effects of forces that move celestial objects.
In simple terms, he is trying to determine the changes in speeds and directions that affect various bodies.
He has applied this type of study to planetary rings, comets, planets, black holes, galaxies and galaxy clusters.
In 1979, he and Peter Goldreich predicted that the rings of Uranus (discovered in 1977) are kept in place by small moons that have not yet been detected.
The proposal met with scepticism from many astronomers, until the Voyager 2 spacecraft flew past the planet in 1986 and confirmed the prediction.
It was quite a triumph.
Thanks to his energy, the institute eventually carved itself an enviable position in the international scene.
In 1987, Tremaine wrote the book Galactic Dynamics with James Binney, which quickly became a reference work in the field.
In 1988, he and other collaborators demonstrated that comets with short periods (comets that visit us every 200 years or less) originate in the Kuiper belt and not the Oort cloud.
This revelation proved to be another high point in his career.
In 1991, Tremaine and Michel Fich determined the mass of our galaxy, the Milky Way, by using information about satellite galaxies (those that orbit our own).
In 1996, he left his position as Director of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics to head the Cosmology and Gravity Program at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Studies.
One year later, in 1997, he left the University of Toronto to become a professor at Princeton University in the United States where he remains today.
Tremaine has received many awards, including being elected as member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Jaymie Mark Matthews (1958- ) Asteroseismologist, outstanding popularizer of astronomy, and mission scientist for MOST: the first Canadian space telescope Jaymie Mark Matthews was born in 1958 in Chatham, Ontario.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree in 1979 from the University of Toronto and his master’s and doctoral degrees in 1982 and 1987 from the University of Western Ontario in London.
In 1988, he undertook postdoctoral research at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
In 1991, he was hired as a research agent at the University of Montreal.
He then became a professor at the University of British Columbia.
Matthews is an asteroseismologist; that is, he specializes in the study of the vibrations (pulsations) that shake stars.
All stars, like the Sun, vibrate at some time during their lifespan.
The study of such vibrations holds great interest for researchers as it provides information on the internal structure of a star, and thus on its size, mass, composition and even age.
In addition to asteroseismology, Matthews has other interests.
In 1987, he began studying Wolf-Rayet stars, which are stars that liberate colossal amounts of matter into space.
In 1992, he tackled the job of mapping solar spots on stars using Doppler imaging.
In 1994, he used open star clusters and groups of open star clusters to calibrate a scale for cosmological distances.
The year 1997 was a particularly significant year for Matthews.
In 2003, after six years of preparation, the MOST satellite was launched.
The satellite is the size and shape of a large suitcase, and is equipped with an ultra sensitive telescope that measures only 15 centimetres across.
Despite its small size, it is ten times more sensitive than the Hubble Space Telescope in detecting tiny variations in the luminosity of stars caused by pulsations that shake their surface.
Since 2004, the discoveries made by Matthews and the MOST satellite regularly make the headlines in the media around the world.
In addition to his research activities, Matthews is constantly involved in all sorts of activities related to popularizing science: newspaper interviews, radio and television appearances, public conferences, telescope tours, supervising students in high school, evening courses, summer camps, work sponsorships, etc.
Particularly popular with young people, he received awards for excellence in teaching in 1999 and 2002.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Jack Newton (1942- ) Known for his world famous photographs Jack Newton was born in 1942 in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
He obtained a diploma in business administration during the 1970’s from Red River Community College and became manager for the stores Sears and Marks & Spencer.
His interest in astronomy began in 1954 at the age of 12.
Four years later, in 1958, he joined the Winnipeg Centre of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
In 1969, he constructed a 32-centimetre telescope and installed it under a dome in his backyard.
He then started up an astrophotography section with the Winnipeg Centre and became the president from 1970 to 1972.
In 1973, Newton’s work required him to move to Toronto.
He began to test different film types for his photography work and one year later, in 1974, he published Astro Photography:
In 1975, he was elected president of the Toronto Centre of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
Still passionate about photography, he published An Introduction to CCD Astronomy and Deep Sky Objects:
A Photographic Guide for the Amateur in 1977.
In 1979, Newton moved again for work-related reasons, this time to Victoria in British Columbia.
He continued to pursue his astrophotography activities and became the president of the Victoria Centre from 1980 to 1981.
He wrote two books with Philip Teece:
Cambridge Deep-Sky Album in 1983, and The Guide to Amateur Astronomy in 1988.
From 1990 to 1991, he again became president of the Victoria Centre and, in 1995, he and Philip Teece wrote a second edition to their book The Guide to Amateur Astronomy.
In 1997, he joined forces with Terence Dickinson and published Splendors of the Universe:
Throughout his career as an amateur astronomer, Newton regularly contributed to the magazines Astronomy, Sky & Telescope and SkyNews, and his photographs could be found in many popular media magazines like Newsweek and Canadian Geographic, or in books like The Audubon Society Field Guide to the Night Sky.
One of his more ambitious trips was in 1986 when he headed a contingent of more than 300 people to see Halley’s comet over Peruvian skies!
Newton received the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977, the Ken Chilton Prize from the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in 1978, the Amateur Achievement Award from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 1988, and the Chant Medal from the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in 1989.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Damien Lemay (1943- ) An extraordinary amateur observer, he works at all levels to popularize amateur astronomy in Canada Damien Lemay was born in 1943 at Saint-Édouard de Lotbinière in Quebec.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree in physics in 1966 from Laval University in Quebec, and became a telecommunications engineer for Québec-Téléphone (now TELUS-Québec).
Lemay made his first forays into astronomy around 1954 at the age of 11.
In 1962, he bought his first telescope, a 11.4-centimetre Tasco reflector that he still has today.
From 1971 to 1972, he used 7x50 binoculars to observe all the stars in the Norton Star Atlas, from the North Pole to -35° South.
In 1973, he took his first long-exposure photos during a guided tour over the night of May 26.
Astrophotography quickly became one of Lemay’s passions and he equipped himself, by the end of that same year, with a 20.3-centimetre Schmidt Cassegrain telescope.
Lemay was probably the first North American observer to see Nova Cygni in the sky in 1975.
A nova is a star that absorbs matter from a neighbouring star, which causes the new host to heat up and suddenly brighten.
It is a rare and spectacular event.
In 1977, he became the French editor of the National Newsletter of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada; he would keep this position until 1989.
In 1978, Lemay began the daunting task of assembling a photographic atlas of the sky using his 14-centimetre Schmidt camera.
He completed the work in 1985 after taking 1,182 photographs.
In 1981, he founded the Astronomy Club of Rimouski in Quebec.
The club was very active and they twice organized the annual conference of the Amateur Astronomy Federation of Quebec in 1990 and 1997.
In 1983, Lemay initiated the first joint meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, the Amateur Astronomy Federation of Quebec, and the American Association of Variable Star Observers.
The conference took place in Quebec City, and with over 200 participants it was deemed an unequivocal success.
From 1990 to 1992, he was the National President of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
From 1992 to 2000, he was Codirector, with R. Hawkes, of the Canadian Fireball Reporting Centre.
The centre operates from Mount Allison University in New Brunswick, and collects statistical data about falling stars that appear over Canadian skies.
The primary goal is to help recover meteorites in the short and long term.
In 2001, the centre moved to the University of Calgary where it falls under the responsibility of Alan Hildebrand.
In 1996, he was one of the founding members of the virtual group ASTRO & CCD of the Amateur Astronomy Federation of Quebec.
The group works solely through the Internet and its members share their digital photos with each other.
From 1997 to 2000, he was Chairman of the Meteorite and Impacts Advisory Committee of the Canadian Space Agency.
Throughout his years as an amateur astronomer, Lemay has helped newcomers in choosing equipment and learning how to observe the sky, and he gives dozens of lectures and presentations each year at schools, scout camps, parks, etc.
He received several provincial and national distinctions in honour of his contributions in astronomy, including the Trophée Méritas ("Méritas Trophy") from the Amateur Astronomy Federation of Quebec in 1982, and the Chant Medal from the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Paul Boltwood (1943- ) Renowned for his attention to detail, he took the best image of the deep sky ever obtained using amateur equipment Paul Boltwood was born in 1943 at Vancouver, British Columbia.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree in mathematics in 1966 from the University of British Columbia in Victoria, and went on to occupy various jobs before becoming President of his own company, Boltwood Systems Corporation, in 1980.
He became interested in astronomy around 1955 and constructed his first telescope around 1958.
After training himself in many techniques, he had completed everything by 1992.
In 1993, he constructed his first telescope with the intent of selling it.
Boltwood also began his own survey of blazars OJ 287 and 3C 66A.
Blazars are galaxies that are tilted such that the jets of radiation emanating from their core are aimed straight at Earth.
The observations and data that he gathered with his amateur equipment were of such good quality that he was able to collaborate with professional astronomers.
In 1997, Boltwood produced fantastic footage of the Hyakutake comet nucleus using his own equipment.
Boltwood was deemed to have taken the best image of the deep sky ever obtained using amateur equipment.
Using his 40-centimetre telescope (that he built himself), his CCD camera, an exposure time of 20 hours in his backyard near Ottawa, and digital processing of the image using software that he developed, Boltwood attained a magnitude of 24.1, even better than the Mount Palomar telescope!
He even managed to improve the image later to a magnitude of 24.5.

Levy’s interest in astronomy began during a partial eclipse of the Sun in 1959 at the age of 11.
In 1965, he began to search for novae and comets in the sky.
By the end of the 1980’s, he was the most prolific observer in the American Association of Variable Star Observers with more than 10,000 observations per year for meteors, variable stars and Messier objects.
Always looking for a better climate and a darker sky, he moved to Arizona in 1980 where he still lives today.
In 1984, after 19 years of fruitless searching, he discovered his first comet.
Today, he is the discoverer or co-discoverer of 21 comets and more than 225 asteroids, including the famous Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet that crashed into Jupiter in 1994.
Author or editor of more than thirty books, numerous articles and more than 1,000 lectures and interviews, Levy is also involved with a number of magazines: he is Science Editor of Parade (USA), Associate Editor of Sky & Telescope (USA), and a regular contributor to SkyNews (Canada).
Over the years, he has developed numerous educational programs in astronomy for young people and the general public.

Astronomers « Return to the instruments The human eye An extraordinary organ The eye is the organ that allows us to see.
Light enters through the cornea and is projected onto the retina, which consists of cells that are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation.
From there, the light signals are converted into electrical impulses that are transmitted to the brain along the optic nerve.
Once the brain has received the pulses, it transforms the information into an image.
The human eye is spherical and its internal parts are transparent so that the maximum amount of light can reach the retina.
The cornea surrounds and protects the eye.
It is made of transparent gel-like material that helps converge light rays onto the retina.
The role of the iris is to control the quantity of light that passes through the cornea, keeping it at a fairly constant level.
Too much light can damage the retina, whereas not enough will prevent a person from seeing properly.
Its centre, the pupil, allows just the right amount of light to pass through so that we can see.
This is why the pupil contracts when there is too much light (like when the Sun blinds us) to prevent excess light rays from reaching the retina, and contracts when there is not enough light (like when we walk into a darkened room) to allow in the most light possible.
Immediately behind the iris is the lens.
It is a true lens in that it converges light rays passing through the eye onto the retina.
The lens of the eye is also flexible and can deform itself to improve the convergence of light.
On the other hand, they are not very sensitive to light rays and need a lot of light to work.
The rods are very sensitive to light and enable us to see when it is dark.
They are not, however, capable of distinguishing different colours and details, and this causes the poor colour contrast between objects that we observe when the lighting is dim.
In all, hundreds of millions of cells must work together in our eyes and brain in order for us to see.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments The first instruments The transit and the sextant
Many different astronomical instruments have been used throughout the ages.
Two stand out as having played particularly important historical roles: the transit and the sextant.
Such diverse fields as stellar cartography (mapping), navigation and the determination of time have all progressed significantly thanks to these instruments.
The transit is used to measure the precise moment that a celestial object passes through its highest point in the sky (also know as the meridian).
Used since ancient Egyptian time, the modern form of this instrument consists of a telescope that only moves vertically.
A dial on one side, graduated from 0 to 90 degrees, is used to measure the inclination of the telescope.
When the celestial object in question passes through the meridian, the observer notes its angle above the horizon at the precise moment of its passing.
These two measurements provide the coordinates (the position) of the object in the celestial sphere.
A map of the sky can be thus be assembled bit by bit and used to create tables that give the positions of stars, planets, the Moon and so on for the purposes of navigation or determining the exact time.
The sextant is an instrument that can be used to determine the angle between a celestial object and the horizon.
Used in conjunction with the transit tables, it is a simple matter to calculate the latitude of one’s position.
The predecessors of the sextant included the astrolab and the octant, both of which operated on the same principle.
The modern version of the sextant was independently invented in the 1730’s by John Hadley in England and Thomas Godfrey in the United States.

Astronomers « Return to the instruments Refracting telescopes Concentrating light by refraction through lenses The Assyrians (people who lived in a region that is known today as Iraq) were perhaps the first to have used lenses to magnify objects, possibly around 1,500 BC.
The evidence is a rock crystal discovered by the English archaeologist John Layard in 1850 during the excavation of the ancient city of Nimrud.
The crystal was cut and polished into the shape of a lens, however it is not entirely certain that it was used as a magnifying lens and not as jewellery or for some other purpose.
Evidence that lenses were in use during the first century BC can be found in the records of the Roman authors Pliny and Senecio who reported that an engraver at Pompeii used a lens to help him in his work.
Other historical evidence reveals that the Arabs were using lenses by the year 600 AD, as were the Vikings around the year 900.
It is difficult to determine when a refracting telescope was first assembled using lenses.
The first person to do so with certainty, and thus the person to be credited with its invention, was the English mathematician Leonard Digges who constructed a refracting telescope sometime between 1540 and 1553 to assist with his topographic surveys.
Leonard Digges – or perhaps his son, the English astronomer Thomas Digges – was also the first to turn a refractor towards the sky to study celestial objects.
The instrument did not become widely known to the public until 1608 when Hans Lippershey (or Lipperhey), a Dutch optician of German origin, began to make and sell telescopes.
Lippershey applied for a patent for what he claimed was his own invention, but was refused on the grounds that the device was already in existence.
The English mathematician Thomas Harriot was the first to study the Moon in detail using an astronomical telescope in 1609, and it is known with certainty that this occurred several months before Galileo Galilei, the famous Italian physicist, did the same.
Galilei, however, was the first to have published his observations in a book entitled "The Starry Messenger" (translated from Latin).
His book revolutionized our concept of the Universe.
The first refracting telescopes consisted of two lenses separated by some distance within a closed tube.
The larger of the two is the objective, or primary lens, and the second is the ocular.
The role of the lenses is to concentrate light rays into a single point – the focal point – so as to obtain a sharper magnified image.
It is the glass of the lens that allows light to be concentrated.
This phenomenon is known as "refraction".
Lenses, to be effective in a telescope, must be shaped so that all the refracted light rays converge in a single point.
Unfortunately, we now know today that it is impossible to focus light from an object into a single point using only one lens.
There are several types of aberrations, the main ones being chromatic and spherical.
All types of aberration cause deformation of the image transmitted by the telescope.
Chromatic aberration occurs because light rays of different colours are not all bent by the same amount as they pass through a lens.
Consequently, it is impossible to concentrate the rays into a single point.
Chromatic aberration causes coloured fringes to appear around the image.
Spherical aberration is due to the shape of the lens.
A lens is nothing more than a piece of glass with each surface shaped like a portion of a sphere.
Unfortunately, a sphere is not the best shape for concentrating light rays into a single point, but is the easiest shape to make when grinding and polishing glass.
Spherical aberration causes images to be blurred.
These days, refracting telescopes are made using several lenses that are designed and put together in ways that minimize the problems caused by aberrations.

Astronomers « Return to the instruments Reflecting telescopes Concentrating light using mirrors In contrast to a refracting telescope, which uses lenses to enlarge images, reflecting telescopes (also known as reflectors) use mirrors to accomplish the same goal.
The advantages are numerous: manufacturing mirrors is simpler and less costly than lenses, there are less aberration-related problems, and the main mirror can be supported from below.
Today, the reflecting telescope is considered as one of the most powerful scientific instruments ever invented.
Sometime between 1540 and 1553, the English mathematician Leonard Digges constructed the first reflecting telescope using a mirror and a lens.
In 1576, his son Thomas, an astronomer, used it to defend the idea that the Universe is infinite, which was a revolutionary concept at the time.
Nevertheless, it would be another 100 years before the reflecting telescope was widely used.
In 1663, the Scottish mathematician and astronomer James Gregory published his book Optima Promota in which he included the design for a new type of compact reflecting telescope.
The English physicist Robert Hooke built the actual instrument several years later, only a short time before Isaac Newton developed his own telescope in 1668.
The principle behind Newton’s telescope was so simple that we still use it today.
It consists of two mirrors: the primary and the secondary.
The primary mirror has a parabolic shape and serves to collect light from the object of interest.
The secondary mirror, smaller than the primary, is flat and inclined in such a way as to reflect light from the primary mirror towards the ocular and the observer.
In 1672, the Catholic priest and French teacher Laurent Cassegrain invented a new type of reflecting telescope that he described in an unpublished manuscript.
The Cassegrain telescope consisted of a primary parabolic mirror, which collected light from the celestial object, and a secondary mirror, which faced the primary mirror and concentrated the reflected light towards the observer by directing it through a hole in the centre of the primary mirror.
The image could therefore be viewed from behind the telescope, and not from the side, as with Newton’s design.
The big advantage to the Cassegrain design is its compact size, which makes it portable.
Moreover, heavy instruments can be installed at its based.
Today, the Cassegrain reflector is the most commonly used type of telescope.

Astronomers « Return to the instruments Invisible light collectors Seeing the invisible Refracting and reflecting telescopes are used to collect and study visible light.
Although visible light provides valuable information, it only represents a tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
To see the rest of the spectrum, which consists of invisible colours, researchers need to use collectors that are capable of detecting wavelengths that correspond to the type of light they wish to study.
For the infrared domain, the parabolic mirror of a reflecting telescope remains the ideal means by which to collect and concentrate the light rays.
Because the light being collected is invisible, the human observer is replaced by an infrared detector at the mirror’s focal point.
Its purpose is to measure the intensity of the infrared rays.
Unfortunately, the situation is considerably more complex for the mid- and far-infrared domains.
One of the complications for detecting infrared sources in space is that the reflecting telescope collects a lot of background infrared light from the atmosphere, from any human observers present in the room, and from the telescope itself.
In addition, atmospheric water vapour absorbs a large part of the infrared rays coming from space, which makes data collection difficult – or even impossible – at some wavelengths.
To overcome these problems, detectors are cooled to very low temperatures (sometimes down to -269 °C) and the telescopes are placed at the highest elevations possible where the air is drier.
Another solution is to put them directly into space, orbiting Earth.
The great interest for astronomers in observing the infrared light of the Universe is due to its powers of penetration.
Infrared waves are capable of passing through dust, allowing us to see regions that are otherwise impenetrable to visible light, such as the interiors of nebulas.
At longer wavelengths in the microwave domain, absorption by water is a persistent problem and the best solutions are to collect data from high elevations or satellites.
In order for light rays to be concentrated at the focal point of a reflecting telescope, the size of the irregularities in the curve of the parabolic collector must be smaller than the wavelength of the light being collected.
Consequently, it is not necessary to use a highly polished reflecting surface like a mirror for light with very long wavelengths, like microwaves; instead, a simple metal dish will suffice.
Microwaves are of immense interest to astronomers.
Cosmic background radiation – that amazing "first light" emitted when the Universe was only a few hundred thousand years old – exists mainly in the form of microwaves.
Radio waves, which have even longer and less energetic wavelengths than microwaves, are typically collected using large metal dishes.
Radio waves are produced by supernova remnants and by electrons passing through the magnetic fields of distant radio galaxies.
For light with wavelengths that are shorter than those of visible light, like ultraviolet rays, it is possible to use optical telescopes.
Unfortunately for astronomers (but fortunately for human beings), most ultraviolet light is absorbed by the ozone layer before reaching Earth’s surface.
It is therefore necessary to use satellites for ultraviolet studies.
Ultraviolet light is the most abundant type of energy generated by very hot stars.
Satellites must also be used to study X-rays and gamma rays, which have wavelengths that are even shorter and more energetic than those of ultraviolet rays.
These light rays are so energetic, however, that they can easily pass through mirrors; special collectors must be used to detect them.
Most X-rays are emitted by pockets of hot gases found between galaxies and near black holes.
Gamma rays are mainly found in the vicinity of supernova explosions.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Photographic plates Memorizing light In the early days of astronomy, astronomers had to draw their observations on paper.
The method was, of course, imperfect and prone not only to errors in reproduction, but also to the unintentional omission of important details.
The invention of photography, which could accurately transfer images to paper, was quickly adopted as a convenient solution.
In fact, astronomers began using photography almost as soon as it was invented.
The principle behind photography is the use of light-sensitive chemicals, like silver salts.
These are dispersed in a gel to create a mixture known as emulsion.
Once the emulsion is exposed to light, the light-sensitive chemicals react and become opaque to varying degrees depending on the amount of exposure.
The result is a photographic image.
It was in 1793 that the French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce first began thinking of a method to record light.
He started experimenting in 1814 and succeeded in setting images on paper in 1816.
In 1822, he made the first permanent photo by using a sheet of polished tin coated with a petroleum derivative called bitumen of Judea (a type of tar).
Unaware of the progress made by Niépce, the British scientist William Henry Fox Talbot began his own set of experiments in 1834 and recorded images on paper in 1835.
His process became known in 1839 and he obtained a patent in 1841.
The French inventor Hippolyte Bayard began his experiments before 1836, but it was only in 1839 that he is known, with certainty, to have successfully recorded an image.
His process was publicized in 1840, and of all the other methods developed before 1841, it was Bayard’s that produced the best and most detailed images.
In 1838, after continuing the work of his associate, Niépce, the French painter and inventor Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre took an image of the Moon at the request of the French astronomer Dominique François Jean Arago.
Daguerre’s technique, which used copper plates coated with silver, was made known to the public in 1839 and the images were called "daguerreotypes".
It would become the most widely used method after 1840.
The German astronomer Johann Heinrich von Mädler came up with term "photography" in 1839 by combining "photo" (from the Greek word for light) and "graphy" (to write).
The word was quickly popularized by the British astronomer John Frederick William Herschel, who is often mistakenly given credit for inventing the word.
In 1840, the American doctor and chemist John William Draper produced a daguerreotype of the Moon: the first astronomical photograph ever created in North America.
The French optician Noël Marie Paymal Lerebours photographed the Sun for the first time in 1842, but no details were visible.
In 1850, two Americans – astronomer William Cranch Bond and photographer John Adams Whipple – produced the first photograph of a star when they made a daguerreotype of Vega (also known as Alpha Lyrae).
Also in 1850, the English inventor Frederick Scott Archer came up with the wet collodion process.
Collodion is a viscous (thick) liquid that Archer used to coat glass plates.
By producing a photographic negative on glass rather than on paper, the resulting images were much sharper and could be made much larger, hence the great interest for astronomers.
Archer published his technique in 1851 and astronomers rapidly adopted the use of photographic plates.
In 1857, using this method, George Phillips Bond of the United States was the first to photograph a double star (Mizar and Alcor).
In 1879, the American inventor George Eastman (who would go on to found the Eastman-Kodak company in 1892) built a machine for coating photographic plates with emulsion that allowed photographs to be produced in great quantity.
During the first few decades of the 1900’s, the Eastman Company worked in collaboration with several astronomical observatories to develop emulsions that were increasingly sensitive to light.
The photographic plate thus became the imaging medium par excellence in the 20th century.
Astrophotography experienced its golden age between the 1960’s and 1980.
Thanks to colour filters, images produced from photographic plates could also be presented in colours, which greatly increased the public’s interest in astronomy.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Filters Blocking some light to reveal more details In 1861, the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell created the first colour photograph.
He made the photo by first placing a black and white photographic plate behind a plate of red glass.
He then repeated the procedure with a green plate, and then blue.
He projected the three "negatives" on a screen using glass plates in the corresponding colours and thus obtained a colour image.
Today, we call Maxwell’s red, green and blue glass plates "filters".
A filter allows some colours to be blocked, which emphasizes the remaining colours that pass through.
By carefully choosing filters, it is possible to reveal details that would otherwise be difficult to see.
In 1878, Frederick Charles Luther Wratten of England founded one of the first companies to supply photographic material.
In 1909, he developed a system of number-coded colour filters that quickly became the standard in the photography industry.
The Eastman-Kodak Company bought Wratten’s company in 1912 and continued to use his filter system.
After acquiring Wratten’s company, Eastman-Kodak began to manufacture filters specifically designed for astronomy work.
The company continues to make them today and, surprisingly, still uses Wratten’s original numbering system.
The market is shared by other companies – like Lumicon, Meade and Orion – who also design filters for professional and amateur astronomers.
Some filters are designed to block out the artificial light of fluorescent and incandescent lighting; this serves to increase the contrast of many celestial objects.
Video sequence   Marie-Maude de Denus-Baillargeon explains what an optic filter is.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Photometers Measuring the brightness of celestial objects A photometer is an instrument that measures and quantifies the brightness of a celestial body (a galaxy, star, comet or planet, for example).
The brightness depends on the luminosity of the object and on the distance that separates the object from the photometer, as well as the amount of matter between the two that can obscure the object.
A very luminous star could appear dim if it is far enough away or is partly obscured by gaseous clouds and interstellar dust.
A photometer has several applications in astronomy.
In the case of a star, for example, a photometer can be used to determine its temperature, its distance and even its age.
Photometers can also be used to determine if planets are orbiting about certain stars.
Let’s take a look at the case of temperature.
A hot star will emit a lot of light in the blue portion of the spectrum (relatively energetic wavelengths), whereas a cold star will mainly emit red light (less energetic wavelengths).
By using a photometer to measure the amount of light emitted at blue and red wavelengths (that is, the "colour" of the star), temperature can be estimated.
The brightness of a celestial object is a measure of its luminous flux: the amount of incoming light.
The luminous flux of a star is dependent on a combination of temperature, the size of its surface, and its distance from Earth.
If we know its temperature (by its colour) and its distance (by other methods), we can calculate its surface area and thus its size.
Astronomers can use photometers to precisely measure the amount of light emitted at specific wavelengths that correspond to the emission lines produced by heated chemical elements.
This information is used to establish the chemical composition of a star.
Many different methods have been developed for estimating the brightness of celestial bodies.
All the initial attempts, however, had a major drawback: the estimate had to be made visually and could vary greatly from one observer to another.
In 1836, the British astronomer John Frederick William Herschel changed all that.
Herschel invented a photometer ("astrometer" as he called it) that allowed the observer to visually compare the brightness of stars using a scale based on the reduced telescopic image of the Moon.
It was the first true photometer.
In 1839, the French astronomer Dominique François Jean Arago proposed the design of a new photometer using photographic principles.
His goal was to eliminate the role played by the observer in determining the brightness of an object by rendering the technique completely objective.
In 1844, the French physicists Jean Bernard Léon Foucault and Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau conducted a series of experiments for Arago in which a photometer was coupled with a daguerreotype.
It took until 1885 for photographic plates to be systematically used in photometry.
It was in that year that the Dutch astronomer Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn began to measure the brightness of 454,875 stars from the Southern Hemisphere.
The technique typically used at the time to determine an object’s brightness consisted of measuring its diameter on a photographic plate.
The more intense the brightness, the more the plate would react and the greater the diameter of the image.
The problem with this method is that if the light is too intense, the emulsion becomes saturated and stops reacting.
In 1910, the American astronomer Charles Edward Pickering found a solution to the problem of saturation: he proposed to measure the amount of light passing through the object’s image on the plate, rather than its diameter.
Many improvements have been made to photographic photometers during the 20th century.
Some of the most notable include the addition of an adjustable iris around a star’s image (1934), the complete automation of the procedure (1969), and the addition of a laser to increase the precision of the data (1971).
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Infrared cameras Photographing the invisible using infrared light In 1800, the German astronomer William Herschel was the first to discover that light is not always visible to the naked eye.
During an optical experiment, Herschel passed sunlight through a prism to separate the white light into its coloured components.
Using a thermometer, he measured the temperature of each of the coloured rays and determined that the temperature increased from blue to red.
Pushing his experiment a little bit further, Herschel placed the thermometer beyond the red light rays where no light was visible.
To his great surprise, he measured a temperature even higher than that within any of the visible rays.
He proved, for the first time ever, that invisible light – the infrared – exists beyond the red portion of the light spectrum.
In 1856, the Scottish astronomer Charles Piazzi Smyth detected infrared light emanating from the Moon.
He conducted his observations at different elevations and realized that the best data had been collected at the highest elevations.
He was thus the first to understand that the terrestrial atmosphere absorbs some part of the infrared light coming from space.
Unfortunately, the composition of the collodion was not revealed and, for the next twenty years, all attempts to produce another infrared photograph failed.
The first publicly known infrared-sensitive chemical compound, dicyanine, was discovered in 1903.
One year later, the American physicist Robert Williams Wood recognized the possibility of improving the sensitivity of infrared photographic film using kryptocyanine emulsion, the chemical cousin of dicyanine.
He conducted experiments and, in 1910, became the first to publish photographs taken in the infrared (the photos were of scenery).
Knowing that the terrestrial atmosphere absorbs some of the infrared rays coming from space, astronomers (both amateurs and professionals) began to collect airborne data beginning in the 1930’s.
It was during one of these expeditions that the American Albert William Stevens used an infrared filter in 1932 to photograph a total eclipse of the Sun from an airplane at an altitude of 8,200 metres.
In 1933, an American, Auguste Piccard, used an infrared camera to photograph the Earth’s ozone layer from onboard the hot air balloon Century of Progress.  In 1942, the Eastman Kodak Company patented the first infrared-sensitive film that could produce photos using "false colours".
  Telescopes borne on rockets were first used to photograph the infrared sky in 1970.
The project, called Hi Star, was active until 1976 and managed to accumulate a total of 30 minutes of observation time.
In all, 2,363 infrared sources were detected.
The first infrared space observatory – IRAS (Infrared Astronomical Satellite) – was launched in 1983 and operated for 10 months.
It mapped more than 96% of the sky and discovered about 500,000 infrared sources.
The ability of infrared light to pass through dust allowed the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way, to be revealed for the first time.
A few years later, in 2003, the Spitzer space telescope was launched.
Spitzer is the "Rolls-Royce" of infrared telescopes and is used to study specific astronomical targets.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments CCD cameras Recording higher quality images without photographic film or plates A digital camera records images using a photosensitive cell called a charge-couple device (CCD).
A CCD is a thin layer of silicon divided into a multitude of small squares known as "picture elements", usually referred to in the shortened form of "pixels".
Each pixel is separated from the next by thin insulators.
To take a photo, the CCD is exposed to light: the same principle as taking a photo using a photographic film or plate.
When light strikes a pixel, however, the silicon produces an electric charge, and the greater the amount of light, the greater the charge.
When the exposure is finished, the camera’s microprocessor reads the charge on the pixels, row by row, and transforms the information into a digital image.
Exposing a CCD for two minutes can therefore reveal more details than is possible during a one-hour exposure using a conventional photographic plate.
Other than photography, CCDs are used in photocopiers, facsimile (fax) machines, scanners and barcode readers.
In 1969, two researchers at Bell Laboratories – the Americans Willard Boyle and George Smith – designed the basic structure of a CCD and defined its operating principles.
Several months later, they developed the first video camera to function with a CCD.
In 1973, the American company Fairchild Imaging developed their first commercial CCD.
Consisting of 100 x 100 pixels, it was used in 1974 to produce the first astronomical photo ever taken by a digital camera.
It consisted of an image of the Moon captured using a 20-centimetre telescope.
In 1976, Fairchild Imaging sold the first commercial CCD camera: the Fairchild MV-101.
In 1979, CCD cameras made their way into professional astronomy.
In 1983, the use of CCD cameras became much more widespread among professional observatories.
For the first time ever, it was possible to study celestial objects thousands of time paler than anything recorded on even the most sensitive photographic plates, putting a whole new face on the Universe.
Today, digital cameras are an integral part of the standard equipment in a professional observatory.
The largest, MegaCam (mounted on the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in 2006) uses a mosaic of 40 CCDs for a total of 340 million pixels.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Spectrometers Pulling light apart to extract information A spectrometer is an instrument that measures the properties of light over a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
There are two types of spectrometers: spectroscopes and spectrographs.
A spectroscope transforms light into a spectrum using a prim that can be observed through a small telescope.
The positions of the lines reveal the chemical composition of the material in question.
In 1860, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Donati had the idea to combine a spectroscope with his telescope.
He studied the spectra of fifteen stars and published his results in 1863.
He was soon followed by the American astronomer Lewis Morris Rutherfurd, the Italian astronomer Angelo Secchi, and the amateur British astronomer William Huggins, all of whom worked independently on the Sun, planets, Moon and stars.
Rutherfurd and Secchi were the first to classify stars into groups according to their spectral characteristics.
In 1864, Donati was the first to clearly observe the spectrum of a comet (Comet 1864b).
That same year, Huggins and Miller succeeded in using spectroscopy to demonstrate that nebulas are clouds of gas, not stars.
As a result of these spectacular discoveries, spectroscopes were the focus of much developmental work and were continuously improved during the 1900’s.
Today, they are entirely automated and controlled by a computer, and the measurement of spectral lines is done using a photodetector.
A spectrograph operates like a spectroscope except that the small telescope is replaced by a detector that can record the spectrum of the material being studied.
The first spectrographs used a photographic camera as a detector.
It was the first photograph of our Sun’s spectrum.
The experiment was repeated in 1843 by the American doctor and chemist John William Draper.
In 1863, Huggins and Miller photographed the spectra of the Sirius and Capella stars using a wet collodion plate.
They thus obtained the first spectrogram (that is, the first spectral image) of a star other than the Sun.
Absorption lines were not visible, however, and the spectrum appeared continuous.
It was several years later, in 1872, that John William Draper would be the first to record the absorption lines of a star, in this case Vega.
The world of astronomy was revolutionized and astronomers applied themselves to spectroscopy in great numbers.
Today, 90% of our knowledge about stars has been possible thanks to spectroscopy.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Polarimeters Determining the direction of light waves to better understand stars and planets In 1669, the Danish physicist Rasmus Bartholin was the first to publish an article on the splitting of light rays by Icelandic spar, a very pure form of the mineral calcite (calcium carbonate).
Without knowing it, he had discovered polarization – a very important property of light.
Unfortunately, without the benefit of a theory that could adequately explain the nature and behaviour of light, Bartholin was unable to deduce the origins of the phenomenon.
In 1678, the Danish physicist and astronomer Christiaan Huygens also observed the splitting of light by Icelandic spar calcite.
He presented an explanation in 1690 that was based on the presence of "ether" – a hypothetical substance that filled space – but it was quickly disputed.
Using this theory, physicists quickly understood that when a natural light source emits light, it generates a myriad of waves that oscillate in planes oriented in many different directions (see illustration).
Consequently, if we project light onto a screen pierced with numerous parallel slits, only the light waves with the same orientation as the slits will be able to pass through.
Only two years later, in 1811, the French astronomer Dominique François Jean Arago invented the polariscope, an instrument that can determine whether or not light is polarized.
Among other things, he discovered that lunar light is polarized.
The study of planet surfaces using polarimetry was significantly advanced by the French astronomer Bernard Ferdinand Lyot.
Working since 1920 at the Meudon Observatory near Paris, he submitted a doctoral thesis in 1929 on the polarization of light reflected from the surface of several planets.
Among his hypotheses was the suggestion that Mars experienced gigantic sandstorms – a prediction that would be confirmed by the Viking 1 probe in 1976.
Lyot died in 1952, but the astronomer Audouin-Charles Dollfus continued his worked at Meudon.
Dollfuss was the first to determine that the surface of Mars consists of iron oxides.
Today, Lyot and Dollfus are considered as the pioneers of planetary polarimetry.
In 1922, he revealed the polarized nature of the solar spectrum emitted by the Sun’s surface away from sunspots.
In 1946, the American astronomer Horace W. Babcock used polarimetry to identify, for the first time, a star other than the Sun that produces a magnetic field (the star was 78 Virginis).
In 1949, the American astronomers John Scoville Hall and William Albert Hiltner independently discovered that 1--3% of the light emitted by many stars is polarized.
In addition, a map of polarized light across the sky revealed large-scale structures of our galaxy.
At the time, the phenomenon and pattern of widespread polarization could not be explained.
The answer was not long in coming, however.
In 1950, the American astronomers Jesse Leonard Greenstein and Leverett Davis Jr. proposed that polarization of interstellar light is due to the presence of dust particles that are naturally aligned with the magnetic field of the galaxy.
The two researchers even developed models that used polarimetric data to detect interstellar magnetic fields produced by individual stars.
Today, polarimeters are used to detect magnetic fields and to study the atmosphere of the Sun and other stars, the surface and atmosphere of planets, the interstellar medium, and nebulas.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Interferometers Combining light rays to increase telescopic resolution In 1801, the British physicist Thomas Young demonstrated that light propagates as waves, like waves on the surface of water.
For example, if the crests (or troughs) of two light waves are coincident, they combine together to create an amplified wave in what is known as constructive interference.
This is destructive interference.
Between these two extremes lie an infinite number of variations in which crests and troughs combine together to intensify or dim the light.
In 1867, the French physicist Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau proposed that the resolution of telescopes could be improved if the collected light signals were allowed to combine with each other via constructive interference.
Unfortunately, the technology of the day did not permit him to construct an instrument capable of combining light waves as they emerged from a telescope.
During the next sixty years, most studies in interferometry centred on the same type of work, such as measuring the diameter of a particular star, or determining the distance between the two suns in a double-star system.
In 1946, the British radio astronomer Martin Ryle, with the help of the physicist Derek D. Vonberg, constructed the first interferometer that could operate in the domain of radio waves.
This breakthrough allowed the two scientists to discover many new celestial objects.
In 1956, the British physicists and astronomers Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Quintin Twiss perfected their first interferometer using separate telescopes.
Operating in the visible light domain, their instrument was tested on several types of stars and the resolution of the images were unequalled by any other imaging method in existence.
The sharpness of the visible details in a normal image is limited by the diffraction of light waves as they pass through the telescope’s objective.
During the late 1960’s and early 1970’s, the arrival of more powerful computers made interferometry increasingly accessible to researchers.
In 1967, a group of nine Canadian researchers – led by the astronomer J. L. (Allen) Yen of the University of Toronto – jointly used the 46-metre radio telescope of the Algonquin Radio Observatory in Ontario, and the 26-metre radio telescope of the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in British Columbia, to simulate a giant radio telescope measuring 3,074 kilometres in diameter (the distance separating the two observatories).
It was the first successful long-distance interferometry experiment ever conducted.
In 1974, under the guidance of the American physicist (and future Nobel Laureate) Charles Hard Townes at the University Columbia in New York City, students Michael Allan Johnson, Albert L. Betz and Edmund Charles Sutton constructed the first infrared interferometer.
  That same year, the French astronomer Antoine Émile Henry Labeyrie developed the first interferometer that could operate in real time.
Prior to Labeyrie’s breakthrough, radiometric data was recorded on magnetic ribbon and sent to a laboratory to be processed.
Today, images with very high resolution are obtained using interferometers.
Local celestial objects have the greatest scientific potential and represent the best targets.
Laminar air currents can also be blown across the surface of the mirror to minimize turbulence.
The Earth’s atmosphere consists of layers of air at different temperatures that interact and cause large-scale movements of air masses (referred to as turbulence by scientists).
For astronomers, turbulence is detrimental to their work as it disrupts the trajectory of light rays.
This causes stars in the sky to twinkle and telescope images to be distorted.
A simple means to minimize the effects of this inconvenient phenomenon is to build astronomical observatories at high elevations so that the telescopes only peer through the upper levels of the terrestrial atmosphere.
The first research into resolving the problem of image distortion related to atmospheric turbulence was conducted in 1902 by the German physician Karl Strehl, who proposed a method of evaluating the image quality produced by optical systems.
In 1941, the Soviet mathematician Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov made several breakthroughs into the study of turbulence.
His work would later be integrated into atmospheric models used to correct distortions affecting astronomical images.
In 1953, the American astronomer Horace Welcome Babcock invented adaptive optics, a process that corrects image distortions caused by the terrestrial atmosphere.
The technique consists of taking a sample of the light received by the telescope and calculating its degree of distortion.
Deformable mirrors are then used to redirect the light rays and produce a corrected image.
The proposal was promising, but Babcock was not able to construct his system for technical reasons.
In 1957, the American physician Robert B. Leighton of the California Institute of Technology succeeded in reducing atmosphere-induced image distortions using the 1.5-metre telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California.
His technique consisted of inclining the telescope’s secondary mirror several times per second.
In so doing, he managed to obtain the best images ever recorded of Jupiter and Saturn.
In that same year, the Soviet physicist Vladimir Pavlovich Linnik published an article in which he proposed that an artificial "guide star" could be created by pointing a laser at the sky and targeting its focal point in the upper atmosphere to agitate gas molecules.
If an adaptive optics system uses a natural "guide star", it must be bright enough compared to the celestial object of interest to provide adequate light for the telescope’s detector.
The guide star and the study object must also appear sufficiently close in the sky.
It is not always easy to find a star that fulfills these criteria, hence the idea of creating an artificial guide star.
In 1970, the American engineer W. Thomas Cathey and his collaborators were the first to experimentally demonstrate an adaptive optics system that operated in real time.
Three years later, in 1973, another American engineer, John W. Hardy, built the first adaptive optics system intended for astronomy.
Originally designed to detect Soviet military satellites, the system used a deformable mirror.
Astronomers took advantage of the technique and new adaptive optics systems began to appear.
In 1977, the American physicist Andrew Buffington developed the first system to use a segmented mirror.
Each of the six segments is controlled by a piston that could adjust the inclination.
In 1981, the American physicist Robert Q. Fugate and his team began to work on a system that would use a laser to generate a guide star – the idea originally proposed by Linnik in 1957.
The first tests were performed in 1983 and 1984.
Since then, several adaptive optics systems have been equipped with a laser that operates on this principle.
In 1991, the American army been declassifying their confidential work on adaptive optics.
Upon accessing the documents, the astronomy community realized that they had already designed and constructed more powerful and less costly systems than those of the military.
As of 2005, 18 observatories and 26 large telescopes are equipped with image correction systems.
These systems are now considered as standard equipment for big observatories

Astronomers Light: a form of energy For us, light is an extraordinary phenomenon that illuminates our world and makes it visible.
What would we do without it?
Since we first opened our eyes, humans have worshipped the Sun as a god of light and a source of life and security.
The emergence of rational thought brought with it a need to question the nature of this phenomenon.
So what exactly is light?
Light is a form of energy produced by matter.
To understand how light is created, we must first take a look at atoms, the building blocks of matter.
In the world of atomic particles, the adage holds true that opposites attract and thus the nucleus and electrons are mutually attracted to each other within the atom.
Although an electron cannot randomly occupy positions within an atom, it can nonetheless change its distance from the nucleus by changing its energy level.
To do this, its energy content must be modified to match the energy level of the new orbit that it will enter.
For example, to move from a distant orbit into a closer orbit, the electron must eliminate some of its energy.
The energy released is partly electrical in nature and – as with all negatively charged bodies – partly magnetic.
This excess energy is released by the electron in the form of an energy packet known as a "photon".
A photon is an energy particle that has no mass and moves at high speed.
When a moving photon interacts with matter, it does so as a wave, like a wave moving across the surface of water.
These waves are known as "electromagnetic waves" because they display both electrical and magnetic components.
In fact, a photon can be thought of as a "particle of light" and an electromagnetic wave as a "lightwave".

Astronomers White light: a mix of colours In 1665, Francesco Maria Grimaldi, an Italian Jesuit priest, conducted a simple experiment the results of which went on to occupy the minds of several generations of physicists, including Newton and Einstein.
To his great surprise, Grimaldi found that the beam of light illuminating the screen was larger than expected.
Strangest of all, however, was that the light was no longer white, but became two or three rays of different colours.
Without knowing it, Grimaldi had conducted the first experiment into the splitting of light.
He assigned the term "diffraction" to the phenomenon, a term that survives to this day.
Grimaldi later realized that diffraction is a phenomenon that does not only occur when light is projected through a slit; instead, it occurs each time light strikes the edges of any object.
Several scientists were interested in the effect but none could explain it.
The answer was not long in coming, however, and it was Isaac Newton himself who would provide the explanation.
In 1662, Newton began his own optical experiments.
One of his first projects was to construct a refracting telescope.
He polished lenses and attempted to improve the instrument by getting rid of the coloured fringes that would appear on the margins of his images (he did not succeed and decided instead to develop a mirror-based reflecting telescope).
In 1666, during one of his optical experiments, Newton passed sunlight through a prism and split the light beam into different colours, like what he observed along the edges of his optical lenses.
Others before him had conducted similar experiments, but Newton was the first to understand that white light consists of a mix of light rays, each with a different colour.
Newton also understood that white light can be separated into its components because each ray of colour is deviated by the glass of the prism by a different amount.
He realized, for example, that red light is consistently less deviated than violet light.
This ordered separation of coloured rays is known as the "spectrum".
The spectrum of white light consists of six basic colours arranged in a specific order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet.
Although Newton understood that a beam of light of a particular colour is always deviated by the same amount, he did not appear to understand why this is so.
More than a century would pass before another British scientist by the name of Thomas Young would provide part of the answer.

Astronomers …or the birth of spectroscopy In 1801, the physicist Thomas Young clearly demonstrated that light travels as a wave, much like the succession of crests and troughs along the surface of water.
One of Young’s most astonishing feats was that he succeeded in measuring the wavelengths of red and violet light; that is, the distance between two crests or troughs of successive waves.
His results revealed a wavelength of 7 thousandths of a millimetre for red light and 4 thousandths of a millimetre for violet.
Combining these measurements with the basic concepts of Newton’s work, he concluded that light with a longer wavelength is less deflected than light with a shorter wavelength.
During the same historic period, around 1802, the British chemist William Hyde Wollaston uncovered a surprising fact: the spectrum of sunlight is not continuous.
In fact, numerous black lines are superimposed on the colours of its spectrum.
Unfortunately, this revelation did not attract much attention and no ideas were advanced to explain their presence.
Several years later, in 1814, the German optician Josef von Fraunhofer noticed the same black lines in the spectrum of sunlight.
Although he did not understand their significance, he nonetheless measured their positions and catalogued a total of 324.
In 1859, the German chemist Robert Wilhelm Bunsen (who improved and popularized the burner that bears his name) devised an original analytical technique: he inserted mineral salts into the flame of his burner and observed the colours produced by the gas emitted.
He was thus able to determine whether a particular substance was present in a mineral by observing a colour that, according to him, characterized that substance.
Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, a German physician and friend of Bunsen, proposed the additional step of dispersing the light emitted by the gas by using a prism.
The two researchers thus made a major discovery: each chemical element generates a series of spectral rays that uniquely characterize the substance, much like a fingerprint identifies a person.
The invention of tTheir new analytical technique, spectroscopy, led to the discovery of many new chemical elements in the years ahead.
Kirchhoff was interested in the spectrum of sunlight and realized that Fraunhofer’s black lines corresponded exactly to the bright rays emitted by specific chemical elements.
He deduced that the white light produced by the hot surface of the Sun was in part absorbed by certain chemical elements present in its cooler atmosphere, which produces black lines in the spectrum.
Kirchhoff’s discoveries opened the doors to spectroscopic studies in astronomy.
To their great satisfaction, astronomers were now equipped with a method for determining the chemical composition of stars and nebulas, and even their temperature, distance, speed and age by measuring the intensity of the different spectral rays and applying basic principles of physics.
It was through spectroscopy that light allowed us to "touch the stars", something long believed impossible due to the great distances involved.
One problem remained unanswered for Kirchhoff: he could not explain how matter could emit or absorb light.
Other researchers would help resolve this enigma 50 years later.
Astronomers A map of visible and invisible light Our understanding of the nature of light took a giant leap forward in the second half of the 1800’s with the help of the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell.
Maxwell was interested in a multitude of scientific problems that included electricity and magnetism.
He first published articles on these subjects in 1855, then compiled his work in 1873 into a book entitled Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, which is now considered a classic in the field of matter.
In 1863, Maxwell discovered that by manipulating equations for electricity and magnetism, it was possible to extract a value that corresponded to the speed of light.
Surprised by this result, he began to suspect that light, electricity and magnetism were one and the same.
To follow up on this idea, he developed new equations for electricity and magnetism and concluded that not only is light a wave – as demonstrated by Thomas Young more than 50 years earlier – but an electromagnetic wave.
The discovery that light possesses both electric and magnetic components proved to be of paramount importance.
Maxwell went on to reason that invisible electromagnetic waves exist beyond the visible and ultraviolet light spectra, but sadly he did not live long enough to test his idea.
Hertz labelled these new waves "radio waves", and their discovery was put to beneficial use in the development of the telegraph and the radio.
Today, the electromagnetic spectrum is known to extend far beyond the colours of the rainbow, as shown in the diagram below.
The portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we can see with our eyes is tiny with respect to its full extent.
If the electromagnetic spectrum was a window 30 million kilometres long, we would only have to open it three centimetres to let in all the visible light.
The electromagnetic spectrum is continuous but scientists have divided it in an artificial manner for practical reasons.
The divisions were mainly established by the limitations of the various techniques used to detect wavelengths.
For example, the limits of the visible light range is defined by what our eyes can detect.
Although other electromagnetic waves – radio waves, infrared light, ultraviolet light, X-rays and gamma rays – represent "colours" that are invisible to us, they are nonetheless forms of light.

Astronomers When matter produces light All material, when hot, will emit light.
Everyday examples abound: the stove element in the kitchen, the metal filament in a lightbulb, and even the Sun.
By the end of the 1800’s, scientists were observing this phenomenon in their laboratories but could not explain it.
Despite this lack of understanding, they nonetheless knew how to separate the light emitted by a gas into a spectrum that was diagnostic of the chemical elements contained in the gas.
In 1859, the German physicist Gustav Robert Kirchhoff called this type of spectrum an "emission spectrum".
Many researchers attempted to explain how matter could generate an emission spectrum but without success.
It was only in 1900 that the German physicist Max Planck would provide part of the answer.
Planck noted that it was impossible to solve the problem using existing principles of physics and proceeded to develop a revolutionary theory that marked nothing less than the beginning of modern physics.
In his theory, Planck maintained that light could only be emitted as small packets of energy that he named "quanta" (later known as "photons").
This proposal ran contrary to all contemporary knowledge about light at that time.
In fact, light was considered to be a continuous form of energy that propagated as an electromagnetic wave and not – as Planck proposed – as a form of discontinous energy in the form of particles, like photons.
The debate finally came to a head – and to a resolution – when the German physicist Albert Einstein entered the scene in 1905.
Einstein not only supported Planck’s idea, he went one step further: he proposed that light behaved as a particle (a photon) but also retained its wave character and must therefore be considered as both a particle and a wave.
Furthermore, Einstein established that the energy of a photon is related to the wavelength of the radiation.
He concluded that waves with long wavelengths, like red light, transport small amounts of energy, whereas those with short wavelengths, like violet light, transport more energy.
In 1913, the Danish physicist Niels Henrik David Bohr integrated the advances of Planck and Einstein into his new model of the atom to explain how matter could emit light in the form of particles.
According to Bohr, the atom consists of negatively charged electrons that orbit around a positively charged nucleus.
The model further specified that electrons orbit the nucleus at well defined distances from the nucleus.
An electron orbiting near the nucleus has relatively little energy because it is held in its orbital by the strong attractive force exerted by the nucleus.
Energy must be added to this electron for it to "jump" to a higher orbital, and the further away it jumps, the more energy it would need.
An electron in a starting position that is farther from the nucleus already has more energy because it must compensate for the great distance that separates it from the nucleus.
Less energy would thus be needed to make this electron jump to a higher level compared to an electron that started closer to the nucleus.
According to Bohr, when a material is heated, some of the electrons in orbitals near the nucleus will absorb enough energy to allow them to jump to new orbital levels at great distance from the nucleus.
The electrons, however, will eventually return to their original orbitals; when they do so, they must release enough energy so that their energy content again matches the energy level of the original orbital.
Given the basic principle that the atomic nucleus of each chemical element has a positive charge different from that of any other element, its electron orbitals must also have distinctive energy contents since the electrons must balance the charge of the nucleus.
The energy given off by an electron when dropping from a distant orbital to a closer orbital will thus be a photon with a characterisitc amount of energy and a corresponding wavelength in the emission spectrum.
If the atoms of a given element have a combination of possible orbital jumps that is different from the combinations possible for the atoms of other elements, then every element will display its own unique emission spectrum.
The following diagram shows the emission spectra for various elements.
Notice how the emission lines are diagnostic, much like a bar code or a fingerprint.
Emission spectra of hydrogen.
Emission spectra of iron.
In astronomy, this phenomenon is often observed when white light, no matter what its source (the surface of the Sun or another star, for example) passes through a thin cloud of gas or dust.
In this case, instead of seeing a continuous spectrum from red to violet, astronomers will observe a spectrum in which several rays of colour are missing and dark lines take their place.
It was around 1802 that the British chemist William Hyde Wollaston noticed for the first time that the spectrum from the Sun displays just this type of effect.
The solar spectrum is discontinuous with numerous dark lines occuring among the coloured bands.
At the time, Wollaston did not understand why this is so.
In 1814, the German optician Josef von Fraunhofer also noticed these same dark lines in the spectrum of sunlight.
Although he also failed to understand their significance, he nonetheless measured and documented the positions of 324 lines.
It was only in 1859 that the German physicist Gustav Robert Kirchhoff understood that Fraunhofer’s dark lines corresponded exactly to the bright lines emitted by certain known elements.
According to him, the dark lines represented specific chemical elements that are present within the Sun’s atmosphere but are absorbing certain spectral rays emitted by the Sun’s surface.
Kirchhoff named this type of spectrum an "absorption spectrum".
Unfortunately, he did not understand at the time how matter could absorb spectral rays.
In 1860, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Donati had the idea of attaching a spectroscope to his telescope.
He studied the spectrum of fifteen or so stars and published his results in 1863.
He was followed in 1862 by the amateur British astronomer William Huggins, the American astronomer Lewis Morris Rutherfurd, and the Italian astronomer Angelo Secchi, all of whom independantly worked on the Sun, the planets, the Moon and the stars.
These researchers began a scientific revolution by being the first to extract information from the light emitted by stars.
They were quickly followed by other astronomers, and the study of emission spectra became the main field of study in astronomy.
Despite considerable progress, the explanation of how light could be absorbed by matter still eluded the scientists of the time.
The Danish physicist Niels Henrik David Bohr finally provided the answer in 1913.
Bohr developed a new model of the atom consisting of negatively charged electrons that occupy specific orbitals around a positive nucleus.
According to Bohr, the farther the electron orbital is positioned from the nucleus, the higher its energy content in order to compensate for the great distance to the nucleus and its attractive force.
When a cool material is heated, some of the electrons will jump from low energy orbitals near the nucleus to more distant and higher energy orbitals.
To do this, each electron must increase its energy content to exactly match the energy level of the new orbital it will occupy.
Bohr proposed that electrons absorb this extra energy in the form of "energy packets" as described by Planck and Einstein.
The same type of phenomenon occurs in space when the light emitted from the surface of a star (like the Sun) shines through the cooler gases in the atmosphere surrounding it.
The atmosphere absorbs part of the white light emitted from the star, which produces a colour spectrum marked by dark lines (absorption lines) that are characteristic of the elements present in the gas.
The study of a star’s spectrum thus gives us information about the chemical composition of its atmosphere.
Astronomers The astronomer’s unit for measuring distance In astronomy, distances between celestial objects – like stars and galaxies – are very large.
For example, the distance that separates us from out closest neighbour, the Moon, is on average 385,000 kilometres.
The Sun, on the otherhand, is on average 150 million kilometres away, and the next closest star is Proxima Centauri at 40,000 billion kilometres.
To avoid manipulating such long numbers on a regular basis, a unit of distance better adapted to the scale of the Universe quickly became a necessity.
One unit of distance commonly used in astronomy is the light-year.
A light-year is the distance travelled by light in one year, which is 9 trillion, 460 billion, 730 million, 472 thousand and 581 kilometres.
It was first necessary to determine the speed of light in order to know the distance that it will travel in one year.
Before 1676, most scientists thought that light moved instantaneously from one point to another.
In that year, however, the Danish physicist Ole Christensen Rømer was the first to demonstrate that light had a finite speed.
In 1671, Rømer began to observe the satellites of Jupiter and decided to measure the time it took for one of the moons (particularly Io) to disappear behind the giant planet and reappear on the other side.
By accumulating data for many years, he determined that the time separating the eclipses was shorter when the Earth was closer to Jupiter and longer when it was at a greater distance.
In 1675, the French astronomer Jean-Dominique Cassini, for whom Rømer was an assistant, proposed that the difference was due to the time it took light to travel from Jupiter to Earth.
However, he quickly changed his mind and abandoned the hypothesis.
Rømer, on the other hand, continued to pursue the idea and estimated that light takes 22 minutes to travel a distance equal to the diameter of the Earth’s orbit (we know today that the true value is closer to 16 minutes and 40 seconds).
If Rømer had calculated the speed of light using his data, he would have come up with an answer of 135,000 kilometres per second, which is about half the accepted value today of 299,792 kilometres per second.
The main source of error would have been the diameter of Earth’s orbit, which was not well known at the time.
It was only in 1729 that the majority of the astronomical community were finally convinced that light had finite speed.
The British astronomer James Bradley published a study demonstrating that the annual variation observed in the position of the stars is related to the speed of light.
He estimated that light travels at 301,000 kilometres per second, which is very close to the accepted value.
In 1838, the German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (and not the Scottish astronomer Thomas Henderson, as is often mentioned) was the first to use the light-year as a unit of measurement in astronomy.
He measured the distance separating us from the binary star 61 Cygni as 10.3 light-years.
The advantage of the light-year as a unit of measurement is not only that it quantifies distance, but that it also provides the time it takes for light to reach Earth.
For example, if 61 Cygni is 10.3 light-years from Earth (97,445,523,867,584 kilometres), then it takes it’s light 10.3 years to reach us.
We are therefore always seeing 61 Cygni as it was more than 10 years ago.
This is how light allows us to "see into the past" and why a telescope is really a type of "time travel machine".
This concept applies equally to very distant galaxies that are measured at distances of 10 to 12 billion light-years: they appear to us now the way they existed 10 to 12 billion years ago, only a short time after the Big Bang.

Astronomers When stars disappear… One of the negative effects of industrialization on human activity and the environment is the production of excessive light.
It may seem strange, but excess light is a form of pollution, particularly at night.
The negative effects of light pollution impact many fields of study, including economics, ecology and, of course, astronomy.
Most people do not consider the surplus of artificial light as a form of pollution because it is not permanent; all we must do is collectively turn out our lights to make it disappear.
In reality, however, such a solution is unrealistic because our society needs artificial light to function.
Light pollution is mainly caused by lighting systems that are misdirected, excessive, inefficient or unnecessary.
Most light pollution is found in urban settings where artificial light sources are numerous.
In these areas, light sources may be partly directed towards the sky, or downward directed light may be reflected upward.
Light is then dispersed by layers in the atmosphere and produces a glow that diminishes the darkness of the night sky.
In large Canadian cities, more than 95% of stars that can normally be seen with the naked eye are no longer visible.
Unexpected negative effects From bacteria to the stars The negative effects of light pollution on human activity are numerous.
From an economic point of view, for example, the use of excessive lighting or unnecessary lighting constitutes a waste of energy that is costly to both the individual and to industries.
In Quebec, the cost of "lighting the sky" is estimated at 45 million dollars per year.
On a larger scale, excessive lighting can have an impact on global climate change if the required electricity was generated by burning fossil fuels.
Wildlife and plants are also affected.
For example, nighttime lighting can confuse animals that migrate (like moths and migratory birds), can modify predator-prey relationships, and can even alter competitiveness within the same species.
In the case of moths, for example, it was discovered that numerous flowering plants declined in numbers when the flight paths of pollinating moth species were affected by light pollution.
It is even possible for entire ecosystems to be affected.
In lakes, for example, zooplankton may stop feeding on algae if nighttime lighting is too strong.
This leads to oxygen depletion in the lake, and many species of invertebrates and fish then die by asphyxiation.
In astronomy, light pollution is a real and pressing problem.
It diminishes the contrast between the dark sky and celestial sources of light, which makes it harder to see the stars.
For the amateur astronomer, it is a major problem because access to a truly dark sky is increasingly difficult to find.
The increasing inaccessibility of the starry sky is unfortunate because it has become evident that amateur astronomy plays an important role in the development of scientific interest among young people.
In 2003, the British government even acknowledged the link between a reduced interest in the sciences and an increase in light pollution!
For professional astronomers, artificial light is undesirable because it interferes with the collection of data.
This is why new observatories are built in isolated regions.
A number of amateur astronomy associations are also involved in protecting our endangered legacy, the starry night sky.
The focus of light pollution abatement programs is to change the habits of the general population, companies and urban planners so that less artificial light will be wasted or misdirected.
The plans typically revolve around three lines of action.
The first consists of using lighting equipment that properly directs light where it is required, and not to the sides or towards the sky.
The third is to use an appropriate level of lighting and to only light when necessary.
Your turn to get involved!

Astronomers The Amerindians The Inuit The Amerindians Stars were an integral part of their lives Before the arrival of Europeans, the Amerindians of Canada saw the starry sky as a place full of characters and stories.
Many of the peoples believed that everything found in nature was a living entity, even celestial objects like the Moon, the Sun and the stars.
In the Amerindian belief system, the Earth is flat and the celestial objects revolve around it.
The planets in the solar system are not thought of as planets, but rather as large stars that are simply brighter than the rest.
The Sun and other stars are seen as lights that move across a solid celestial canopy.
For the majority of Amerindian societies, each star is a spirit – a powerful and sacred being.
The Iroquois even oriented their long houses according to the four cardinal directions so that the Sun would shine onto the entrance at dawn, and set in the direction of the exit.
The Amerindians grouped many of the stars into constellations, and most of these are associated with stories that serve as a lesson to youngsters.
Some of the constellations, like Pleiades or the Great Bear, were also used to mark the seasons.
This is the case for one of the Mi’kmaq legends of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
One spring day, Mother Bear woke up after hibernating through the winter.
Being very hungry, she immediately began to look for food.
Chickadee, who was also very hungry, decided to hunt Mother Bear.
Too little to hunt on his own, he got six of his friends to help.
After hunting all spring and all summer, the slowest and heaviest hunters beginning with the two owls flew lower and lower until they eventually lost the trail of Mother Bear.
Blue Jay and Pigeon were the next to abandon the chase.
Completely covered in blood, he shook himself near the trees of the forest, colouring them red.
That is why, since then, the leaves of the trees turn a vivid red colour in autumn.
As much as he tried, Robin was never able to remove all the blood that stained his chest, and he still wears his red marks today.
The three friends ate Mother Bear and left her skeleton there.
During the winter, the spirit of Mother Bear left the sky and came to rest within another sleeping bear.
The bear awoke the next spring and Chickadee and his friends hunted her too until they killed her in autumn.
The story has repeated itself every year since then.
This legend reveals how the change in position of the Great Bear constellation in the sky serves to mark the beginning of autumn.
The Amerindian societies in Canada used a lunar calendar of 10 months with 30 days in each month.
Amerindian legends Dreamlike celestial stories The North Star, which remains in a fixed position in the sky, was well known to Amerindian peoples.
The following legend describes its origin according to the Blackfoot of Alberta:
Two sisters sleeping outside woke before dawn and looked up at the sky.
One of them pointed towards the Morning Star (Venus) and said, "That star is so beautiful, I will take it as a husband."
Several days later, the same young woman came across a handsome stranger in the forest while she was carrying wood.
He was observing her, so she asked him, "What do you want from me?"
The young man replied, "I am Morning Star.
You wanted me as your husband, so here I am."
He placed a feather in her hair and asked her to close her eyes.
He flew her up to the sky, into Sky Country.
"You may use this tool to harvest vegetables in our garden, but you must never touch the sacred turnip.
If you do, it will bring misfortune."
Time passed by and the woman gave birth to a baby.
To her surprise, she found that she could see her tribe and old home through the hole left by the turnip.
Be careful, for he must not touch the ground for 14 days or he will return to me and become a star."
Unfortunately, what should not have happened did, and the child was forced to return to the Sky Country.
But as he tried to pass through the hole left by the sacred turnip, the child became stuck.
And that is why, to this day, there is a star that does not move across the sky.
In some cases, the same celestial constellation is the subject of legends in more than one Amerindian society.
For example, two tribes in Canada have stories about the constellation Pleiades.
This one is from the Iroquois of Ontario.
Many years ago, an Iroquois tribe began the trek toward their winter hunting grounds near a large lake in southeastern Canada.
Upon their arrival, tribe members hurried to set up camp and tackle their chores.
Eight children, tired of helping their parents, would gather together each day away from the tribe to dance for several hours.
He was covered from head to toe with a coat of shiny white feathers and said to them, "If you do not stop, misfortune will come your way."
The children did not listen and continued to take longer and longer breaks during which they never stopped dancing.
Day after day, the old man came to warn them until one evening, the children suddenly found themselves rising up into the air.
The old man shook his head and thought, "If only they would have listened to me."
Not long after, the people of the village saw the children floating high in the sky.
One of the children recognized his Father’s voice and stopped dancing, but quickly fell like a shooting star to the ground.
Seven brothers living alone in the Northern Plains passed their time looking for their parents.
Always on the move, they were looking for food and a new shelter to sleep in.
Tired of such a miserable life, the youngest among them, who was playing with a spider’s web, said, "Why not transform ourselves into something else?
"Don’t be stupid," another replied.
"Rocks can be broken."
"What about trees?
Trees don’t break – they bend with the wind," said one of the brothers.
"Even the greatest trees can be uprooted by wind and storms," argued another.
"Why not take on the form of Night?
Night is never destroyed!" exclaimed one of the brothers.
"Night is scared of light, and runs away when Day arrives," replied another.
"Then why not change into stars?" asked the wisest of the brothers.
"They live in the sky and never die."
The seven brothers thought that was the best idea.
The youngest helped each of his brothers climb into the sky using the spider’s web.
He put three of them to his left, and three to his right.
He then took his place in the middle, and there they remain to this day.
Astronomers The Amerindians The Inuit The Inuit Their knowledge of the stars helped them navigate in a hostile environment where reference points are few and far between The Inuit peoples living in the Canadian Far North can view the dark night sky continuously for long periods of time.
At the North Pole, for example, the Sun rises and sets only once each year.
Contrary to popular belief, however, the polar night does not last for six months each year; instead, it lasts for four and a half months.
The difference is due to the tilt of the Earth, which causes dawn and twilight to last for several weeks at the poles, thus shortening the duration of the true polar night by six weeks each year.
Nonetheless, four and a half months is still a remarkably long night, and one might think that the peoples of the Arctic would have built up an extensive astronomical knowledge base.
This, however, does not appear to have been the case.
The time during which the northern peoples have access to the starry night sky is actually much shorter than four and a half months, even for the Inuit who live closest to the North Pole.
Clouds and aurora borealis also mask the stars.
Finally, the intense nighttime cold makes observation physically difficult.
As such, the Inuit have only two and a half months per year to observe the starry sky if we take into account the presence of the Moon, and only two months per year if we take into account the other factors.
All in all, the peoples of the North have difficult conditions to deal with and only a short period of time for studying the stars.
The ancient Inuit believed the Earth (Nunarjuaq in the Inuktitut language) to be a flat and stationary body around which celestial objects revolved.
It occupied the centre of their universe.
The Moon (Taqqiq) was seen as a flat disk of ice, and the Sun (Siqniq) as a ball of fire.
The disappearance of the Sun below the horizon for several months was taken as a sign that the cold and frost of winter had weighed it down so much that it could no longer lift itself into the sky.
The planets of the solar system were seen as large stars, and the distant stars as holes in the celestial dome.
Interestingly, the existence of the North Star – the polar star that remains in a fixed position in the sky and around which all the other stars appear to revolve – appears to have been unknown to the peoples of the North.
Only 33 stars were familiar to the ancient Inuit and only six or seven of them were given names.
Among them were several that were used for navigation during their travels.
As for the other stars, they were grouped into 16 constellations, most of which were associated with myths in which humans and animals played central roles.
Four men were hunting a bear.
The bear escaped by climbing into the sky and the hunters decided to follow it.
As they climbed higher and higher, one of the Inuit lost a mitten and decided to return to Earth to fetch it.
The other hunters continued their hunt in the sky and we can still see them today climbing after the bear in single file.
The Inuit measure the passage of time by using the arrival of the full moon, and their lunar calendar thus has 13 months.
The year begins at different times for each Inuit society depending on their latitude, although the signal that marks the New Year is the same for each tribe: it is the moment when the Sun reappears above the horizon after the long polar night.
This, of course, explains why the timing varies according the tribe’s northern location.
One such story from the Inuit of the Canadian Central Arctic tells how light first appeared on Earth:
In the beginning, darkness was everywhere.
There was no light on Earth, and it was not possible to see the ground, the animals or humans.
Strangely enough, however, an animal could transform into a human, and a human into an animal.
There were several different animals, like bears, hares and foxes, but when these animals became human, they all became the same: they spoke the same language, lived in the same style of home, and hunted the same way.
It was during this time that magic words were created.
A word mentioned casually during a conversation could suddenly acquire magical powers, and nobody could explain how or why.
One day, a fox and a hare were having an argument.
The fox kept repeating "Darkness!" because he liked the way he could use the dark to steal the hunting catches of the humans.
The hare, on the other hand, kept repeating "Daylight!" because he needed light to help him find food.
Since then, night and day take turns shining over Earth, and the fox and the hare take turns finding food as well.
For the Inuit, the Sun is generally seen as a woman, and the Moon as a man.
A long time ago, after the World was created, a great shaman acquired such strong powers that he went to live in the sky.
The brother and sister lived in harmony for a long time until a great disagreement arose between them and the brother hit the sister, marking her face with a disfiguring burn.
The young woman left her brother to take refuge elsewhere in the sky where she became the Moon.
Since then, the brother and his fire have followed her, trying to reach her, but never succeeding.
The following is one example from the Inuit of Canada’s Eastern Arctic:
A powerful angakoq (shaman) decided to visit the Moon.
At his request, his hands were tied with a leather cord and the lamps in his home were extinguished.
The shaman then prayed to his tormaq (spirit guide) to transport him to the Moon, and the spirit complied.
Once he arrived, he realized that the Moon was a house.
He entered and saw a beautiful woman, the Sun, to his left who asked him to put out the lamp in front of her.
It is important that you do not laugh, or misfortune will come your way."
The couple began to dance before the shaman.
To his great surprise, he saw that the Sun-Woman had no back, no spine and no entrails; only a heart and lungs occupied her chest.
The dance was very strange and the faces made by the couple so peculiar that the shaman ran away lest he should laugh.
Soon after, the shaman decided to return to the house, determined not to laugh.
Once the dance had ended, the Moon-Man graciously welcomed him and invited him to visit his home.
In one room, the shaman saw large herds of deer that roamed over vast plains.
In another room, he saw many pods of seals swimming in the ocean.
The Moon-Man let the shaman choose one of each as a gift.
The shaman told them his story of what he had seen on the Moon.
The Moon-Man is often seen as a strong and fair spirit.
This legend from the Inuit of Labrador is one such example:
A young orphan lived with a family that treated him badly.
He slept in the entrance tunnel with the dogs and ate only leftovers.
Only the youngest of the Girls in the home treated him well.
One night, while he lay on the ground staring up at the Moon, he thought of ways to escape.
The more he stared at the Moon, the more convinced he became the he was staring at a human face.
He was so certain the face was real that he pleaded to the Moon-Man to help him escape.
The Moon-Man heard him and descended to Earth.
He took the young orphan with him onto the beach where he flogged him with a whip.
With each crack of the whip across his body, the boy became stronger and bigger.
In the morning, the boy returned to the house and struck down all those who had been cruel to him, with the exception of the kind young Girl.
She became his wife, and he became the leader of the village.
After all, it is only natural for humans to wonder how far our planet lies from the Moon, the Sun and other celestial bodies.
The ancients believed that this distance was not very far at all: they saw the stars as being fixed upon a nearby celestial dome.
Over the course of time, however, astronomers began to realize that the size of the Universe is much greater than anyone had ever imagined.
Today we know it is so big its limits remain unknown.
In the 3rd century B.C., the Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos calculated the Earth–Moon and Earth–Sun distances using the angle between the Moon and the Sun at the first quarter moon.
His method—based on imprecise data available at the time—estimated that the distance to the Sun is about 20 times the distance to the Moon.
Although we now know that the Sun is really about 400 times the distance to the Moon, Aristarchus’ estimate was nonetheless revolutionary because it suggested that the Sun was much more distant than previously believed.
Several decades later, another Greek astronomer, Hipparcus of Nicea, performed an amazing scientific feat by calculating the Earth–Moon distance with an error of less than 10%.
He did this using the time it takes for the Moon to pass through the shadow of the Earth during a lunar eclipse, and by applying his own ingenious geometric calculations.
Hipparcus also relied on the work of Eratosthenes of Cyrene who had fairly accurately estimated the diameter of the Earth to be 42,000 km (the real diameter is about 40,000 km).
Even more precise parallax measurements would have to wait until the development and improvement of astronomical instruments.
In fact, it was almost two millennia later in 1672 when Jean-Dominique Cassini, a French astronomer of Italian origin, and Jean Richer, a French astronomer, used more modern equipment to precisely measure the average Earth–Sun distance (also known as an "astronomical unit").
Their method relied on simultaneous observations of Mars from Paris and French Guyana.
The honour of being the first to measure the distance to a star other than the Sun must be given to the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel.
In 1838, he calculated the distance to 61 Cygni as 11 light-years from Earth.
These days, astronomers have several methods for measuring distances.
For objects within the Milky Way, most methods employ the method of parallax.
Another method for measuring galactic distances uses Type 1a supernovae: stars that generate constant amounts of energy after their supernova explosion.
They can be thought of as a "bomb standard": an explosion of known strength and luminosity.
Their apparent brightness in the sky is thus a measure of how far away they are from Earth.
Although these types of methods for measuring astronomical distances have allowed scientists to estimate the extent of the Universe, the sheer scale of it is mind-boggling.
It is somewhat easier to visualize such vast distances if we begin by imagining something smaller, like our own solar system.
The solar system consists of the Sun, planets that revolve around the Sun, and millions of smaller bodies.
The Oort Cloud, a vast reservoir of comets that circle the Sun, marks the outer limit of the solar system.
The distance to this boundary is about 1.6 light-years (recall that each light-year is almost 10,000 billion kilometres).
If you can imagine Pluto—the smallest and farthest of our solar system’s planets—as the same size as the head of a pin measuring 1 millimetre across, then the Sun would be as big as two 30-centimetre beach balls lying side by side 2.6 kilometres away from the head of the pin.
Our solar system lies in the Milky Way spiral galaxy.
At this scale, the size of our own solar system is quite insignificant.
In fact, if our entire 1.6-light-year solar system could sit on the head of a pin, the rest of our galaxy would be the size of a hockey rink!
The Milky Way is bunched together with more than 35 other galaxies to form a galaxy cluster known as the Local Group.
The largest member, the Andromeda galaxy, is visible in a moonless night sky without light pollution.
The other galaxies in the group, like the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud, are typically smaller than the Milky Way.
The Local Group occupies an area with a diameter of about 10 million light-years and a centre lying somewhere between the Milky Way and Andromeda.
If you can once again imagine the solar system as a head of a pin and our galaxy as a hockey rink, then the entire Local Group would measure 6.25 kilometres across.
The giant Virgo galaxy cluster marks the centre of the Local Supercluster at a distance of 50 million light-years.
The Virgo Cluster contains a "cannibal" galaxy at its centre—M87—that draws in and absorbs neighbouring galaxies.
Galaxy superclusters appear to be grouped together along long filaments that stretch out for hundreds of millions of light-years.
They are separated by immense voids that contain very few galaxies.
The size of these virtually empty spaces is truly incredible—on the order of 100 million light-years.
This grand-scale pattern defines the Universe across a distance of about 13 billion light-years.
As much as we try, we cannot directly observe what lies beyond that distance.
Astronomers Space Time The arrangement of matter Time The Universe existed in a highly compressed state more than 13 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since For a long time, scientists thought that the Universe was immutable—that it was unchanging over time and stars were the very essence of eternity.
It was only during the 20th century that scientists realized that this belief is false, and that the cosmos changes even on human time scales.
In other words, the Universe did not always display the same structure it does today.
It evolved over time, and thus it has a history.
This fascinating history began just over 13 billion years ago with a great explosion known as the Big Bang.
The Big Bang theory was first presented in 1927 by the Belgian astronomer and priest George Henri Lemaître.
Using Einstein’s theory of relativity combined with astronomical observations, Lemaître demonstrated that the Universe is expanding.
Although the Big Bang theory was not well received by Einstein and his colleagues, it is now widely accepted in scientific circles.
The turning point came in 1929 when American astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble published a short article in which he demonstrated that galaxies are moving away from each other: it was an idea that supported the expanding Universe theory of Lemaître.
Another source of support for Lemaître’s theory came almost 20 years later in 1948 when an American physicist of Ukrainian origin, George Gamow, began to publish alone, and then with colleagues, a series of articles describing the events that took place during the first few moments after the Big Bang explosion.
According to Gamow, the Universe was like an extremely hot "energy soup" that rapidly cooled enough to allow the first atomic nuclei of hydrogen and helium to form.
Gamow’s work thus explained the long-standing mystery of why the Universe contains 99% hydrogen and helium.
Gamow and his colleagues proposed that a glow permeated the early Universe when those first atoms were created, and that even today—13 billion years later—we should be able to detect this residual glow as radio waves from across the Universe.
The world of astronomy was in for a remarkable revelation in 1965 when American physicists Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson somewhat serendipitously detected a weak radio signal coming from all directions of the cosmos at once: the famous cosmic background radiation predicted by Gamow.
Penzias and Wilson went on to receive the 1978 Nobel Prize for Physics for their discovery that helped prove the Big Bang theory.
The dramatic early moments of the Universe can be summed up as follows:
In the beginning, the Universe we observe today was concentrated into a single minuscule point.
It was only once it exploded simultaneously in all directions during a tiny fraction of a second that space was created and time began to flow.
Our current understanding of the beginning of the Universe starts 10 millionths of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a second (10-43 seconds) after the Big Bang.
The Universe expanded somewhat slowly at this point, but its temperature was extraordinarily high: at least 100,000 billion billion billion (1032) degrees.
The cooling rate was extremely rapid, however, and only 100 billionth of a second later, its temperature had already dropped to 100 billion (1011) degrees!
A spectacular event then occurred: the size of the Universe abruptly multiplied by 1050 times (that’s 100 billion trillion trillion, or a 1 followed by 50 zeroes).
The Universe was still extremely hot so the particles were much too agitated to combine with each other and form atoms.
All this would change 300,000 years after the Big Bang when the temperature of the Universe had fallen to a mere 3,000 degrees.
At this temperature, the movements of subatomic particles were sufficiently slow that the first atoms could finally form.
Electrons—which up to this point had been spending their existence capturing and releasing photons—were now tied up with atomic nuclei (protons and neutrons) to create these first atoms.
Finally freed from their struggle with the electrons, photons began to move throughout space to create the earliest light energy: cosmic background radiation.
Video sequence   Hubert Reeves explains that the Universe has a history.
Astronomers Space Time The arrangement of matter The arrangement of matter As the Universe cooled, matter became more complex After the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe continually dropped as matter organized itself into increasingly complex forms.
At the grand scale, the cosmos was initially filled with a homogenous gas consisting mainly of light chemical elements.
At long last, the Universe ceased to be dark as it began to fill with stars that would eventually combine to form galaxies.
It was in the core of these first stars (and all stars since then) that heavier chemical elements—like carbon, oxygen, silicon and iron—began to form via nuclear reactions.
At the end of each star’s life cycle, these "new" chemical elements were released into space where they enriched the clouds of interstellar gas.
Gravitational forces eventually regrouped the matter in these clouds to create a new generation of stars.
The life cycle of stars is responsible for adding all kinds of chemical elements to the Universe.
Under very special conditions, it is even possible for atoms in the space between stars to combine with other atoms and form simple molecules, or even complex molecules like amino acids.
Some stars gain planets after being born.
Planets can be terrestrial (that is, made mainly of metal and rock like the Earth and Mars), whereas others are made mostly of gases, like Jupiter and Saturn, or ice, which is probably the case for Pluto.
The Earth is a peculiar case because water can exist in liquid form.
Thanks to this simple fact, it was possible for organic molecules (those consisting of carbon atoms) to arrange in complex enough patterns to allow life to form.
Although we are fairly certain that life began on Earth at least 3 billion 800 years ago, we still know very little about the conditions that allowed life to originate.
Astronomers Equipment and preparation How does a star finder work?
Equipment and preparation Astronomy is both a science and a pastime that can be practiced using only basic equipment and without being an expert The rewards of astronomy were never more accessible than they are today.
The recent profusion of spectacular images, the explosion of knowledge and technical possibilities, the ubiquitous presence of the Internet, and the widespread accessibility to equipment have catapulted popular astronomy into a new era.
Astronomy can be practiced during the day or night.
In the daytime, it is possible to observe the Moon, several planets, and our own star, the Sun.
It is dangerous to view the Sun directly.
Instead, you should project its image onto a cardboard screen using binoculars or a telescope, or install special filters onto a telescope before looking through it.
Solar spots, which are dark regions on the Sun’s surface, are easily seen when viewing the Sun using these methods.
Bring a notebook and pencil to take notes.
A flashlight with a red filter will help you see your way in the dark without blinding your friends or yourself.
Now that you are all set up, familiarize yourself with the constellations using only your eyes: constellations help guide us to the celestial objects we wish to observe.
Once you have learned to orient yourself, binoculars will be very helpful – even professional astronomers commonly use them.
Mounted on a tripod, binoculars provide magnificent celestial vistas, revealing the topography of the Moon, the moons of Jupiter, a good number of nebulas, and even some galaxies.
At some point, you will want to add a refracting or reflecting telescope to push your observations to the next level.
The most important feature of a telescope is its optical precision of its optical components.
Look for well-known brands that have established and reliable reputations.
Newtonian-type telescopes are generally more affordable due to their simple design.
At the other end of the spectrum are amateur telescopes that are as powerful as those used by professionals thanks to computers and CCD cameras.
In some cases, the telescope can be left outside while you make your observations from inside, comfortably seated in front of your computer.
Luckily for those who do not own a telescope, there are many astronomy clubs with members who share a passion for space and are more than happy to let others look through their telescopes.
Do not hesitate to contact an astronomy club: the people are invariably a very welcoming bunch.
How does a star finder work?
An indispensable sky map A star finder (also known as a planisphere) is a circular map with an overlay that turns to show – through an opening in the overlay – the region of the sky that is visible for a specified time, date and location.
It is an incredibly useful tool for orienting yourself in the night sky, for identifying constellations, and for planning your stargazing night.
For southern Canada, a star finder designed for 45E north is sufficient.
The way a star finder works is simple.
The days and months of the year are shown around the edge of a circular base, and the hours of the day are displayed around the overlay.
By turning the overlay to line up the time of your observations with the date, the portion o the sky that is visible will appear through the opening in the overlay.
All that remains is to hold the star finder over your head and orient it with respect to North.
Instructions The activity simulates a real star search.
Simply click the hour you want and then drag the mouse over the circle in the middle and indicate the date and precise hour that you intend to search the sky overhead.
A precise representation of the sky at that precise moment may be viewed onscreen.
Use the star searcher to pinpoint stars, constellations and planets precisely.
Then wait for a starry night to use your star searcher to locate the constellations and stars that fill our sky.
The ASTROLab thanks the National Research Council of Canada for permission to use their electronic planisphere and to allow us to develop an interactive version of it.

Verbatim Image 1 (At school) Narration  This summer, I had the most amazing vacation camping with my family.
I know what you’re thinking:
"Sound  s boring!"
But let me tell you more about it… Sound  School area Image 2 (In the car) Narration   We left the city and were driving to some unknown destination.
In fact, I was beginning to think we were lost.
Bubble Are we almost there?
Bubble I’m hungry.
Sound  Car Image 3 Mother  Stop pestering your Father  !
We’re almost there… aren’t we?
Girl  Why are we going to spend our vacation in the woods near a river?
There’s nothing to do!
Boy  Yeah!
No stores, no video games… Nothing to see for miles around.
Sound  Car Image 4 Narration  My parents had decided to bring us fishing even though they knew my brother and I didn’t want to spend our vacation in the country.
They told us that the decision had been during a family meeting.
Bubble Meeting?
Sound  Car Image 5 (In the forest) Narration  When we arrived at our destination, we were not on a river.
Instead, we parked in a clearing in the mountains.
I was sure we were lost.
Girl  But there’s nothing here.
No friends… No music… Mother  You mean noise… Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 6 Boy  Dad, are you sure you wouldn’t rather be in a hotel in the city?
Father  I guarantee that what I am about to show you cannot be found in the city!
On the other hand, I could think of a really long list of things that can be found in the city but not in the forest!
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 7 Narration  When nighttime came, my Father  showed us something really amazing.
Father  Look!
Boy  Oops!
Bubble Wow!
Narration  There were thousands of stars in the sky.
It was fantastic!
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 9 Boy  I never realized there were so many.
It’s hard to believe!
Girl  Do you know what that white band across the sky is?
Father  That’s the Milky Way.
Our galaxy.
Narration  It was incredible!
There were so many more stars out there compared to in the city.
I’d never seen anything so beautiful.
Narration  My dad was right.
It was our galaxy.
He explained that the Milky Way contains at least 100 billion stars!
And beyond it, there are billions of other galaxies, each of which contains billions more stars!
I’m telling you, it made me dizzy just thinking about it… Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 11 Boy  I don’t understand why there are more stars here than in the city.
Girl  It’s the same sky after all!
Mother  The reason is light pollution.
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 12 Girl  What’s light pollution?
Boy  It’s light that blinds us.
Mother  Your brother is right.
Light pollution is the artificial light we shine towards the sky that hides the stars.
It’s caused by light aimed in the wrong direction, or too much light, or lights that don’t even need to be on.
And it doesn’t just make stars disappear… it creates a bunch of other problems too.
Narration  My dad told us that in cities like Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver, more than 95% of the stars have disappeared from the sky.
That’s a lot!
There’s almost none left!
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 13 Boy  You’re exaggerating… Girl  Yeah… light isn’t like greenhouse gases.
We can turn off lights.
Light isn’t permanent.
Narration  But my parents weren’t exaggerating.
And it’s not just disappearing stars that are the problem.
Light pollution also has negative effects on animals, plants and even our health.
Not to mention that it’s a big waste of money and energy.
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 14 Mother  Even though the effects of light pollution aren’t as serious as climate change, they’re still significant.
Mother  The starry sky has inspired humanity for thousands of years, yet today it’s disappearing.
Narration  When my Mother  <br /> said that, it made me sad.
I realized that most kids in our country have never even seen the Milky Way.
Sound  Countryside, animals, fire, strange noise Image 15 Narration  Suddenly, a strange thing happened!
A man came out of nowhere and joined in our conversation about light pollution.
Amerindian  Your parents are right.
Girl  Who are you?
Mother  Where did you come from?
Amerindian  I’m from around here and my name is Magella.
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 16 Narration  Magella explained to us that the stars are our link to the Universe.
Without them, mankind is like a family living in a house without windows.
The starry sky is our window onto the cosmos… it’s our view into that fantastic place that gave birth to the Earth.
Light pollution closes that window.
Amerindian  Light pollution upsets many types of animals.
For example, some birds fly into buildings because the lights disorient them.
Even people are affected.
There are some important chemical substances inside us that our bodies can only make when it gets dark.
Life on Earth needs the night.
Amerindian  Would you like a marshmallow?
Sound  School area Image 18 (In the forest) Narration  I asked Magella what we can do to help.
His answer was a bit surprising… Amerindian  Discussing it is enough for now.
You will figure out on your own how you can help.
Girl  Stop talking nonsense!
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 22 Narration  It was amateur astronomers coming to watch the sky. astronomer Good evening everyone!
Beautiful place, isn’t it?
He might have a telescope and computer, but without his gizmos he wouldn’t even know how to find Cassiopeia.
Narration  The man talking to us was the Technician  of the Mont Mégantic Observatory.
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 24 Boy  But his stuff is so cool!
Technician  It sure is.
A telescope is a very powerful piece of equipment!
Don’t forget, though… you can still admire the stars without one.
Girl  True!
Technician  Yup!
All you need are your eyes in a place like this where the sky is really black.
There’s no point in using fancy equipment if you’ve lost our sense of wonder!
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 25 Boy  Sure, but you have to admit, this telescope is really cool!
Technician  You’re absolutely right.
Telescopes have changed our view of the world.
Looking through a telescope is like magic.
It shows us the Universe!
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 26 Technician  Look up at the sky.
Using only your eyes, you can see stars planets constellations Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 27 Technician  And you can use a star finder to help you find the main stars and constellations in the sky.
Girl  Neat!
Father  Did you come here because this is one of the best places for stargazing?
Technician  Absolutely!
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 29 Girl  And there’s nothing we can do about it!
Technician  Come with me… I want to show you something.
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 30 Narration  The Technician  walked us through the woods for a few minutes.
Boy  Where are we going?
Mother  I didn’t realize we were so close to the observatory.
Boy and Girl  Wow!
Sound  Countryside, animals and fire Image 31 (At the observatory of the Mont-Mégantic) Technician  I want to tell you about the program we put into place to curb light pollution.
Father  Certainly. But everyone must make an effort.
This is my best vacation ever!
Technician  Play the interactive game to reduce light pollution.
Technician  Now you can see through the telescope.
Narration  Imagine!
I got to look through one of the biggest telescopes in Canada.
There’s just one word I can think of to describe it:
WOW!
The astronomer knows what he wants to see, and the Technician  knows how to see it using the telescope.
Girl  Hey, it’s pretty cold here!
Father  The nights are chilly in the mountains, even in summertime.
Technician  And the telescope room is never heated.
Even in the winter!
If we heated it, the heat would leave through the dome and blur our vision of the stars.
But the control room is warm!
That’s where we keep our screens, computers and some hot chocolate to keep us awake!
Boy  Wow!
That’s Saturn!
Narration  These days, astronomers don’t look through telescopes with their eyes… instead they use instruments.
Luckily for us, they had just installed an ocular the night we were there because they were getting ready for the public astronomy festival taking place the following day.
Father  It’s hard to imagine, isn’t it?
Technician  In fact, stars are so far away that the light they emit takes several hundred years to reach us!
Their light carries a picture of how the stars looked several hundred years ago… It’s basically an image of the past!
They date back to when the Universe was very young.
That’s why we say that telescopes are like time travel machines!
Girl  Is it true that astronomers are a bit like explorers of the history of the Universe?
Technician  Yes, that’s true.
By exploring the stars, we have discovered that our existence here on Earth is part of 15 billion years of cosmic evolution.
The history of the Universe is our history too… Mother  Fascinating!
Technician  I don’t know if we are alone or not, or why we are here, but one thing is for certain: it’s all infinitely spectacular and mysterious… Never knowing the answer doesn’t really matter.
The most important thing is not to lose our sense of wonder.
Image 36 (In the forest) Boy  I can hardly wait for nighttime so we can start stargazing again!
Mother  But we’re leaving today.
Boy and Girl  Oh no!
We want to stay for the astronomy festival!
Sound  Countryside and fire Image 37 Father  Okay!
Boy and Girl  Yay!
Sound  Countryside and fire Image 38 Girl  Yay!
Thanks, Dad!
Boy  Thanks, Mom!
Boy  I bet I can find Cassiopeia before you!
Girl  You’re on!
And now I’m starting up a project to help us see stars from where we live.
Other Girls  Cool!
I’ll sign it!
All the Girls  Me too!
Boy  In the end, I won.
I found Cassiopeia before my sister!

Canada and Astronomy During the era when the New World was discovered and Canada was taking form, mankind believed that the earth was the centre of the universe.
About the same time that Québec was founded, a revolutionary event was taking place in Europe that would shake the very foundations of man’s view of the world: the invention of the telescope.
Ancient theories were shattered, the earth was but an insignificant heavenly body in the cosmos and humanity had lost its traditional points of reference.
The telescope marked the end of the geocentric universe and the passage toward a Universe of unconceivable dimensions.
Since then, astronomers have continued to perfect this fabulous instrument and explore awe-inspiring cosmic landscapes.
Thanks to telescopes, we have discovered a new world.
Canada was in the throes of nationhood at the same time as new astronomy was emerging and participated in its development and discoveries.
Did you know that at one time, two of the four largest telescopes in the world were in Canada?
Were you aware that our first observatories served to determine time with precision?
Did you know that today Canada is involved in some highly sophisticated projects, and that Canadian astronomers are renowned for being the most efficient in the world?
Indeed, few Canadians are aware that between 1994 and 2004, work carried out by Canadian astronomers resulted in the best "citation rate" in the world.
And what does this mean?
It means that on average, each paper published by a Canadian astronomer has been quoted 16 times by other astronomers around the world , and that this average is the best recorded for all countries.
The citation rate by peers represents a means of measuring the usefulness and quality of research carried out.
Based on the "Canada under the Stars" virtual exhibit highlights aspects of the legacy left to us by the impassioned stargazers of our country.
It is thanks to this legacy that modern Canadian astronomers have garnered a world-class reputation in the field of astronomy.

• Two class periods of approximately 45 minutes each are recommended to complete the exercise.
Parts 1 and 2 could be completed in the first session, Part 3 in the second session.
Part 3 requires student access to the Internet.
Part 4 is not accounted for in this timeline.
Materials Required Access to the Internet (Part 1 – teachers only, Part 3 – student access required) Land Cover Poster-map – Canada’s Land Cover (Part 2)
Main Objective Students will use the online Atlas of Canada and promotional poster-map to successfully interpret maps that use satellite imagery and other thematic information.
They will identify the dominant types of land cover in Canada and will compare two different classifications using information from the interactive Terrestrial Ecozone Map.
Lesson Sequence Part 1:
Teacher and Student Resources This section highlights the learning resources available to teachers from the Atlas of Canada Web site to find and prepare an introductory session for students about the Land Cover Poster-map and the data used to produce it.
A sample note and worksheet is included.
Part 2:
Canada’s Land Cover Using the Atlas of Canada Poster-Map Using the Land Cover Poster-map, students work in groups to identify the types of land cover for specific locations across the country.
First, they will use a standard atlas to identify the province/territory for each location on the map.
They will record this information in an organizer.
Land Cover and Terrestrial Ecozones Maps Using the Online Atlas of Canada Students will use interactive maps in the online Atlas of Canada to verify the land cover classification for each location in their organizer.
They will also use the Terrestrial Ecozones Map to identify the ecozone, physiography, climate and soil for each location.
This information will be added to their organizer.
Finally, students will choose two different types of land cover from their organizer and explain the differences using information collected throughout the exercise.
Extension & Evaluation Ideas Included in this section are discussion questions to conclude the exercise and ideas for evaluating student work.
Teacher and Student Resources Introduction The Atlas of Canada Web site has many learning resources available to teachers and students.
For this lesson, we recommend using some of the background information available online as an introduction to students before they begin working with the poster-map or online maps.
Information Available to Introduce the Land Cover Poster-map From the Land Section Above
Access detailed information about the Land Cover Map (Select Read about this map beside the map title to find this information.
This information can also be accessed by clicking the same links on and around the map.)
Canada’s Land Cover Using the Atlas of Canada Poster-Map Introduction Using the Land Cover Poster-map, students work in groups to identify the types of land cover for specific locations across the country.
They will record this information in a Land cover Organizer.
• The Land Cover Poster-map Teacher Note and Overhead – Introduction to Land Cover Student Worksheet – Introduction to Land Cover Copies of the organizers:
Steps
The teacher could also distribute a handout for students to review or pre-read before the exercise begins.
If computer access is readily available, you may want students to use the Web site to find this information themselves.
Introduce students to the concept of land cover using resources from Part 1.
Divide the class into groups.
Each group will be responsible for identifying the province or territory and type of land cover for specific places across Canada.
For the purposes of this lesson, we have divided the places on the map into 4 groups, with 8 places in each group.
Students use the Land Cover Poster-map to begin completing the organizer (see sample organizers below).
They will use the poster map and a paper atlas to complete the first two columns of information.
• Students use the interactive Land Cover Map in the Atlas of Canada Web site to verify the types of land cover and note the characteristics for each location in their organizer.
They will also use the interactive Terrestrial Ecozones Map to identify the ecozone, physiography, climate and soil for each location.
Materials
•
Choose Land from the pop-out menu that appears.
Choose Land Cover Map under the title Land Maps.
Use the Zoom In tool to find each location listed in your organizer.
Remember, this map has 31 different types of land cover.
•
Steps for Using the Interactive Terrestrial Ecozones Map Select Environment in the left hand menu under the title Explore Our Maps.
Choose Ecology from the pop-out menu that appears.
Choose Ecological Framework under the List of Topics.
Select the Terrestrial Ecozones Map under the title Ecological Framework.
Identify and record the ecozone for each place in your organizer.
Now you need to find information about the physiography, climate and soil for each location based on the ecozone.
To do this:
• Select the Get Info from Map tool above the map, and then choose the ecozone in which each place is located.
(For example, Vancouver is located in the Pacific Maritime ecozone.
Choose Get Info from Map, then select the Pacific Maritime ecozone on the map.)
A table of information will open.
Record the information about physiography, climate and soil for this ecozone.
Discussion Questions
• What other factors influence the types of land cover found within different regions of Canada?
What are the advantages and disadvantages of using an online atlas versus a paper atlas?
Essay Question Why is Canada’s land cover important to monitor and map?
Project Extension Students choose one type of land cover and investigate the physical and human factors that affect this classification.
They will present their findings in a poster presentation.
How do we use the land?
Landscape diversity is a product of the land’s many aspects.
An agrologist will look at the same area and interpret its features in terms of the processes that formed a given type of soil (such as chernozem or podsol).
A tourist will notice the area’s overall relief.
A politician will view the particular land as a nation or an administrative region.
Demographers and sociologists will study it as the backdrop of life, of populated places, or a setting for rural activities.
It is where we move, live and build.
Classifying Types of Land Cover Using Satellite Imagery
• There are 9 different types of land cover shown on the Atlas of Canada Poster-map.
The online map uses 31 classifications and is much more specific.
Each type of land cover can be identified by its unique spectral signature.
A spectral signature refers to the distinct appearance of each land cover class as seen by the satellite.
This means that each type of land cover reflects a specific wavelength of light and this unique signature is identified by a specific colour on the map.
A general colour guide to identify land cover classes is shown below.
Colour Guide:
• Medium brownish colours portray transition treed shrubland.
Yellow/orange to reddish colours stand for broadleaf forests.
Pink and red colours represent mixed forests.
Light greenish yellow to beige represents cropland.
Bluish and grey colours in the north stand for tundra.
Purple in the south represents grassland.
White stands for snow and ice.
Bright green in the North and mid latitudes represents wetland and shrubland
Student Worksheet – Introduction to Land Cover Definition of Land _____________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________
Like a puzzle, a landscape is a mosaic of countless features that mean something different to everyone.

Population Density Plan – Lesson Description Lesson Overview In this lesson, students will describe and explain population density patterns in Canada.
First, students will complete a "Pop Quiz" to determine their current knowledge of population in Canada.
Second, students will use the Atlas of Canada’s new Population Density poster­map to find the correct answers to the questions asked in the "Pop Quiz’ and then use the poster­map to make generalizations about population density patterns in Canada.
Third, students will use the interactive population density map from the Atlas of Canada Web site to collect data and compare the density patterns of various Canadian cities.
In addition, students will examine the advantages and disadvantages of living in an area with a high population density to areas of low population density.
Fourth, extension and evaluation ideas are provided.
Grade Level This lesson fits very well with the geography and social studies curriculum for Grades 9 to 12 in many provinces and territories.
It could also be modified to suit students from Grades 7 to 8.
· Two class periods of approximately 45 minutes each are recommended to complete the exercise.
Part 1 and 2 could be completed in the first session, Part 3 in the second session.
Part 4, the extension and evaluation ideas are not accounted for in this timeline.
Materials Required Part 1
· Analysis Activity Sheet
· Access to the Internet
Main Objective Students will successfully extract geographic information from print and non­print sources to describe and explain population density patterns in Canada.
Introduction Students will be introduced to the concept of population density, prior to completing a "Pop Quiz" to assess their current knowledge of population patterns in Canada.
Canada's Population Density Poster­map Using the poster­map, students will search for the correct answers to the "Pop Quiz" from Part 1.
Second describe population density patterns based on information from the poster­map.
Extension and Evaluation Ideas This section includes a research assignment that builds on the themes of this lesson.
Introduction Introduction For this lesson, we recommend introducing the topic of population and population density to students before they begin working with the maps.
Once students are familiar with the concept of population and population density they can attempt the "Pop Quiz" to assess their current knowledge of population patterns in Canada.
Introductory Instructional Strategies To familiarize students with three primary means of describing population (total population, population density and population distribution):
· Brainstorm with students their understanding of the terms total population, population density and population distribution.
· Have the students record definitions for these terms in an organizer or in their notes.
· Ask students to clear their desks or close their books.
Tell them that they are about to take a "Pop Quiz" to see how much they already know about various characteristics of Canada’s population.
Decide if you want them to work individually or in pairs.
This could work well as a Think, Pair, Share activity.
Distribute the quiz and allow approximately 5 minutes for completion.
There are no marks allocated to the quiz.
Discuss with students their responses to the various questions of the quiz.
Avoid correcting or providing answers to the questions as students will find the answers to the quiz in Part 2 of the lesson.

Population Density Interactive Map Introduction Students use the interactive Population Density, 2001 Map from the Atlas of Canada Web site to understand the relationship between population and area.
They will find and compare the population densities of several Canadian cities and begin to explain why some areas are more densely populated than others.
Students will also examine the advantages and disadvantages of living in an area with a high population density and a low population density.
Teacher Instructions
· Distribute the Analysis Activity Sheet to students before they access the Internet for this section of the lesson.
Review the instructions with students so that expectations are clear.
Analysis Activity Sheet ­ Canada's Population Density In this section of the lesson you will use an interactive map from the Atlas of Canada Web site.
You will find various Canadian cities and collect data about their population, area and density.
By the end of this section you should be able to explain why cities that have similar populations can have drastically different densities.
You will also examine the advantages and disadvantages of living in an area with a high population density and a low population density.
Follow the steps below to complete this activity.
Part A:
· Go to the Atlas of Canada Web site at: atlas.gc.ca Select People and Society from the left hand column under the title Explore Our Maps.
Choose Population from the pop­out menu that appears.
Choose Population Density, 2001 Map under the title 2001 Population.
Choose Read about this map.
Read the text and answer the question below:
What is Canada's population density? _____________________________________________
Part B:
Finding the data In this section, you will compare cities of similar populations and find their population density.
· Select the Population Density, 2001 Map of Canada.
· Complete the organizer below for each city that is listed.
o Choose the Zoom In tool and then click on Toronto.
Keep zooming in until it shows the census subdivisions in the legend.
o The purple areas represent the highest population densities.
Use the Get Info from Map tool and then click on the City of Toronto.
Record the 2001 population and population density.
o Choose Toronto Statistics beside the title Statistics Canada’s Community Profile and record the land area from their Web site.
Toronto's population is double the size of Montreal's, yet Toronto's population density is smaller.
Why? ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________ 2.
Explain why Victoria has a higher population density than Ottawa.
Compare the city of Vancouver to Edmonton based on population, density and area.
Compare Charlottetown to St. John's based on population, density and area.
Go back to Part A of this activity.
What is Canada's population density?
Extension and Evaluation Ideas
Use the other 2001 population maps from the Atlas of Canada Web site to research population distribution and change for a specific region of Canada.
Research questions:
Is the population growing or declining in your region?
Why?
(Students can investigate various factors which affect regional changes in population growth and decline, such as the economy, urbanization and natural resource depletion.)

The map is based on satellite data obtained from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) on board the NOAA-14 satellite.
The spatial resolution is about 1 kilometre.
This means that one pixel on the map is equal to one square kilometre on the ground.
Each land cover type can be identified by its unique spectral signature.
Each signature is identified by a particular colour on the map.

The physical geography of Canada comprises two great parts: the Shield and the Borderlands.
The Shield consists of a core of old massive, Precambrian crystalline rocks.
It is divided into five sub-regions:
Kazan, Davis, Hudson, James and Laurentian regions.
Each of these regions has its own geological characteristics.
The Kazan Region consists of vast areas of massive rocks that form flat, broad, sloping uplands, plateaus and lowlands.
The general aspect of the Davis Regions landscape is that of a broad, old erosion surface almost without surficial deposits.
Viewed from an elevated location, the landscape presents an even horizon interrupted by rounded or flat-topped ranges of hills.
Along the eastern coast, the relief is generally high.
The Hudson Region forms the main central depression on the surface of the Shield.
One of its sub regions, the Hudson Bay Lowland, is a low, swampy, marshy plain with subdued glacial features and a belt of raised beaches that border Hudson Bay and James Bay.
James Region exhibits the characteristic features of the Shield that are apparent in major uplands and plateaus.
The Laurentian Region comprises uplands and highlands that rise abruptly above the St.Lawrence Lowlands along their northwestern border.
The Borderlands regions are formed by younger rocks and surround the Shield like two rings: an inner ring, and an outer ring.
The inner ring comprises a chain of lowlands, plains and plateaus of generally flat lying sedimentary rocks.
The outer ring consists of discontinuous areas of mountains and plateaus in which the younger rocks are deformed.
Each of these areas is divided into regions each of which comprises many smaller subdivisions that are distinctive based on their topography and geology.
The physiographic regions forming the Borderlands include the Innuitian Region, the Arctic Coastal Plain, the Arctic Lowlands, the Interior Plains, the Cordilleran Region, the St.Lawrence Lowlands and the Appalachian Region.
The Innuitian Region is characterized by two zones of mountains that are separated by extensive and discontinuous terrain of more subdued topography formed by plateaus, uplands and lowlands.
The Arctic Coastal Plain includes the coastal terrain along the shores of the Arctic Ocean from Meighen Island to Alaska.
It is divided into three sections each of which has distinctive physiographic characteristics.
The Interior Plains is characterized in the southern part by semi-arid prairies; the central part is tree-covered; and the northern part is covered by tundra.
The Cordillera is divided into three large longitudinal zones called the Eastern System, the Interior System and the Western System.
Each system is further divided into areas and subdivided into mountains, ranges, plateaus, hills, valleys, trenches, basins, and plains.
Each has its own geological and physiographical characteristics.
The Cordillera is also divided transversely into a number of segments by east-west belts of relatively low terrain.
The St. Lawrence Lowlands comprise three separate parts; the West St.Lawrence Lowland, the Central St.Lawrence Lowland and the East St. Lawrence Lowland.
These lowlands are plainlike areas.
The Appalachian extends from southern Quebec and Gaspésie to encompass New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and the island of Newfoundland.
The physiography is dominated by a well-developed peneplain that is generally highest in the northwest and slopes gently southeastwardly to the ocean.

Canada, with 3.33 people per square kilometre, has one of the lowest population densities in the world.
In 2001, most of Canada's population of 30,007,094 lived within 200 kilometres of the United States.
In fact, the inhabitants of our three biggest cities  Toronto, Montréal and Vancouver  can drive to the border in less than two hours.
Thousands of kilometres to the north, our polar region  the Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut  is relatively empty, embracing 41% of our land mass but only 0.3% of our population.

The satellite image of Canada is a composite of several individual satellite images from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor on board various NOAA satellites.
The colours reflect differences in the density of vegetation cover: bright green for dense vegetation in the humid southern regions; yellow for semi-arid and for mountainous regions; brown for the north where vegetation cover is very sparse; and white for snow and ice.

Over southern Canada maximum snow depth usually occurs in January or February, while the time of maximum accumulation occurs much later in mountain areas and in the Arctic.
The main features of the map are the pronounced maximum in snow accumulation over the western Cordillera (British Columbia and Yukon), where snow depths can exceed several metres, with a secondary maximum over Quebec and Labrador.
These maxima are related to their proximity to oceans, which act as sources of moisture and winter storms, and to the orographic effect of L the mountains in the case of western Canada.
The two maxima are linked by a band of higher snow A L A accumulation that follows the boreal forest zone; this is a preferred K track for winter storms.
To the north of this zone is the relatively shallow snow cover of the Arctic (low snowfall with extensive wind packing).
To the south, the depth of snow is limited by the shorter accumulation season and the substantial sublimation of snow over the Canadian Prairies.

Daily observations of the depth of snow on the ground have been made at most Canadian synoptic stations since the 1950s and at most climate stations since 1980.
Unfortunately, the stations in the snow-depth network are mainly located in southern Canada and do not adequately sample mountainous regions or high latitudes.
Daily Snow Depth Station Network, 1997
Snow-depth data are used extensively in applications such as regional climate monitoring, evaluation of climate models, roof snow load calculations for the National Building Code, snow-clearing contracts, winter survival of crops, biological studies and calculation of forest-fire severity.

In 1949, Newfoundland enters Confederation as the tenth province with the boundaries as delimited in 1927.
Canadas long and diversified settlement history is reflected in the two distinct patterns of boundaries that differentiate between eastern and western Canada.
The eastern boundaries closely conform to natural features such as drainage basins, while the boundaries of western and northern Canada reflect the administrative organisation of these lands by, first, the Hudsons Bay Company and later the Government of Canada.

In 1905, Alberta and Saskatchewan are created as provinces with the boundaries they have today and the District of Keewatin is transferred back to the Northwest Territories.
In 1898, the District of Yukon is separated from the Northwest Territories to become Yukon Territory; its boundaries are changed to those of today in 1901.
The boundaries of Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec are extended northward in 1912 to their present boundaries.

There are six time zones in Canada.
The island of Newfoundland observes a sixth time: it decided to set its clock at the halfway point of its time zone, or 3 hours and 30 minutes behind Greenwich time instead of four hours (which would be Atlantic time).

The median total income of persons 15 years of age and over with income was $22 120 in 2000.
The median income is the amount which divides income size distribution into two halves, where the incomes of the first half are below the median, while those of the second half are above the median.
Total income is income accrued from earnings, government transfer payments and other income.
The map shows the median total income for the census divisions where the population density is greater and equal to 0.4 persons per square kilometre.

Export Requirements Shipping and Customs Services International Freight Forwarding in Canada June 2006 (Revised Report) (Original Report January 2000)
The Government of Canada has prepared this report based on primary and secondary sources of information.
Readers should take note that the Government of Canada does not guarantee the accuracy of any of the information contained in this report, nor does it necessarily endorse the organizations listed herein.
Readers should independently verify the accuracy and reliability of the information.
This report is intended as a concise overview of the market for those interested in its potential and is not intended to provide in-depth analysis which may be required by the individual exporter.
Although every effort has been made to ensure that the information is correct, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada assumes no responsibility for its accuracy, reliability, or for any decisions arising from the information contained herein.
International Freight Forwarding in Canada Transporting products from the production site or from the exporter's dock to the final destination is a complex undertaking.
Using the services of an international freight forwarder has many advantages and is often recommended for agricultural exporters, particularly when penetrating new or difficult markets such as developing countries.
International freight forwarders act on behalf of exporters in arranging transportation services.
The freight forwarder facilitates the international movement of goods by providing a wide range of advisory, administrative and physical services to the exporter.
International freight forwarders are multi-modal transportation specialists and are well placed to select the transportation method best suited for the type of product and the final destination at the lowest cost.
Most freight forwarders handle land, ocean and air transportation but usually have separate departments.
The freight forwarding industry in Canada consists of roughly 280 companies which employ about 15,000 employees.
They have offices in more than 150 locations across the country, although offices are mainly found in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.
Most international freight forwarders in Canada are members of the Canadian International Freight Forwarders Association (CIFFA), a well respected professional association (see CIFFA’s website at www.ciffa.com). CIFFA is a member of the International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations (FIATA).
When selecting a freight forwarder, an exporter should verify that the company in question is a member of CIFFA.
Members are required to carry minimum liability insurance coverage and must adhere to standard trading practices and responsibilities for freight forwarders.
Functions of the International Freight Forwarder According to the CIFFA, the most elementary role of the international freight forwarder is to arrange for the movement of goods from point A to point B, in accordance with the client's instructions, in the most economical, timely and safe fashion.
The ten major functions a forwarder can perform are: 1.
Freight forwarders can recommend the best (economical/timely/safe) routing and book space with a carrier.
Thanks to more efficient routing an exporter's goods may be more competitive in new markets.
Packaging:
They advise on or arrange for appropriate packaging, marking and labelling; or containerization.
This includes directions on stowing and container use.
Customs Clearance:
Freight forwarders need a basic knowledge of how local and foreign customs clearance works, and what papers are required for it.
They give advice on foreign import regulations.
Transport Insurance:
Unless the exporters make their own insurance arrangements, the forwarders are usually asked to do so because of their knowledge of the available coverage and their limitations.
Warehousing and Distribution:
Freight forwarders arrange storage, either after customs clearance or while still "in bond", and give advice on facilities, rates and procedures.
They also arrange for the distribution of large lots, including re-labelling and re-shipping.
Rate and Contract Negotiations:
Forwarders command a large volume of freight and are thus in a position of strength to obtain the best possible rates.
Finding Alternatives:
Forwarders are flexible and can find alternative ways of moving the goods in the case of an emergency such as earthquakes, strikes, weather or riots.
Groupage/Consolidation:
Smaller shipments may be moved into a full carload/trailer load/container load, at great savings to the exporter.
A World-Wide Network:
With branches or correspondents in all major ports/cities they act as groupage or degroupage agents, attend to reforwarding and customs clearance and are available for advice and consultation.
Follow-Up:
Forwarders stay in touch with their customers and see to it that their shipments, once delivered to the carrier, do indeed move out and reach their destination.
Furthermore, freight forwarders can provide the exporter with an initial quotation on the following:
• Cost of freight
• Port charges
• Consular fees
• Cost of special documentation
• Cost of insurance
Advantages to Freight Forwarding Freight forwarders are able to offer transportation consolidation services that are often cheaper than those the exporter could arrange directly with the transportation company.
If the exporter has insufficient volumes to fill a rail car, ocean container or highway truck, the freight forwarder can consolidate the shipment with other small shipments into a larger, more economical load.
The final cost of a full load is less for everybody involved.
At the destination, the freight forwarder or agent will unload and deliver the "deconsolidated" shipment to its destination in the target country.
Similar savings may be attained when freight forwarders negotiate volume discounts for clients or by using the freight-all-kinds (FAK) rate system.
In this case one rate is charged although different commodities are combined in a shipment.
For small firms, it may be more efficient to use the services of an experienced international freight forwarder than to develop an in-house transportation management unit.
Selecting a Freight Forwarder When selecting a freight forwarder, the exporter may find recommendations from other exporting firms and trade specialists useful.
Likewise, trade associations may be helpful and facilitate the selection process.
If you are exporting for the first time it is wise to speak with several freight forwarders before deciding which one to use.
The company's references and relevant experience in the destination country should be considered.
The following criteria should also be considered: 1.
Is the freight forwarder a member of CIFFA? 2.
Is the freight forwarder a member of the International Air Transport Association (IATA)?
Although IATA membership is not mandatory when dealing with international air cargo, freight forwarders registered with IATA must meet criteria regarding financial and credit standing, physical facilities, professional qualifications and ethical practice.
Does the freight forwarder have a good credit rating?
Check with carriers to see that the freight forwarder has a good payment record.
Review a copy of their annual report.
Does the freight forwarder have a record of customer satisfaction?
Ask for a list of satisfied customers and contact them.
Does the freight forwarder have knowledge of and experience with your product, desired shipment method, carriers and destination country? 6.
Does the freight forwarder have a network of overseas agents and an office near the shipping port and in the destination country? 7.
Is the freight forwarder large enough to handle your business?
Do they have sufficient staff to handle your shipment? 8.
Do they have warehousing facilities if needed? 9.
Does the freight forwarder carry "errors and omissions insurance"? 10.
Does the freight forwarder have favourable shipping rates and schedules?
What services are provided free of charge? 11.
Does the freight forwarder offer a complete package of services (freight forwarding, brokerage, packaging, etc.)? 12.
Does the freight forwarder have electronic communications and electronic data interchange (EDI) capability? 13.
Does the freight forwarder have time to answer your questions?
Contracts The following contract elements should be discussed by the exporter and freight forwarder prior to finalizing a contract: 1.
A list of the transportation phases that are the responsibility of the freight forwarder.
Contract dates.
The date on which the freight forwarder will take charge of the product.
The delivery date.
A precise description of the delivery address and the names of the contact persons.
All the required export documentation.
Details of what constitutes proof of delivery to the consignee at the agreed point of delivery or transfer of ownership.
Insurance claim file.
Contract conditions should be in accordance with INCOTERMS 2000.
When deciding to use the services of a freight forwarder, the exporter should provide the freight forwarder with a Shipper's Letter of Instructions in addition to all other pertinent documents.
This letter will ensure that the forwarder is made aware of any special handling requirements and other administrative needs.
Other Considerations At times a freight forwarder may be hired just to arrange for a product to be transported.
This service is provided for a fee that will include the services as well as the cost of transporting the goods.
The exporter will normally factor in these costs when arriving at the price charged to the foreign buyer.
Sometimes freight forwarders specialize in one of two main transportation modes such as sea or air or have experience with one particular country.
Some freight forwarders have extensive networks that will prove more effective that others.
Only a limited number of freight forwarders truly specialize in the transportation of goods to developing countries.
Sometimes the forwarder will act as a broker for the carrier and will be paid a commission.
When acting as the carrier in contracts with exporters, performing freight consolidation work, forwarders are called non-vessel-owning common carriers.

NOTES:
Sailings and destinations change frequently.
For up-to-date information contact agents and individual shipping line websites.
Many ocean carriers have formed alliances designed to increase sailing frequencies and realize economies of scale.
Typically members of an alliance "pool" their ships on a particular trading route and allocate part of each ship's capacity to alliance members.
In this way alliance members can offer higher sailing frequencies than would be possible using only their own ships.
Also, alliances are used to achieve cost efficiencies, especially in terminal operations.
As a result of these alliances and agreements, shipments arranged through one carrier may actually be moved by a ship operated by another.

ALGERIA Agri-Food Country Profile Statistical Overview July 2004 Forward This information piece is provided to update the statistical information of existing documents on Algeria.
Due to recent economic developments an update was deemed necessary.
The government is currently focusing its attention on economic modernization and international relations, with specific goals of reducing unemployment and diversifying a petroleum-based economy.
In 2001, the Algerian government launched an economic recovery platform that supported a drive towards economic growth and stability.
The US$7 billion dollar program focused on revitalizing agricultural production, stepping up public water, improving transport and infrastructure, improving living standards and promoting local development.
Additional reforms seek to integrate Algeria into the world economy, freeing the country from it’s dependence on the hydrocarbon industry, and enabling private enterprise to access the energy and mining opportunities within the country.
The path towards liberalization of the economy has already shown positive impacts.
In 2003 economic reforms, as well as reforms to investment regulations attracted US$2.3 billion of foreign direct investment (FDI), the second largest destination for FDI in the African continent.
Current Situation The Algerian economy has grown steadily in the last few years, with growth rates of 4% in 2002 and 7% in 2003.
This growth is a result of strong performance in the oil and gas industry and regular increases in hydrocarbon and agri-food production.
Despite drawing in a lot of revenue for the economy, the oil sector does not contribute positively to the unemployment problem.
This has resulted in Algeria placing great emphasis on decreasing large scale unemployment estimated at 29% in 2003.
This number may reach as high as 50% for the under 30's age group.
With 60-70% of the population under the age of 30, the government has recognized the need for decisive action to alter the countries employment numbers.
The government generally relies on the army to maintain stability, but with the recent re-election of the first non military President, Abdelaziz Bouteflika with 85% of the popular vote, stability is expected to be maintained via other methods over the next two year period.
This non military leadership, supported by a majority of the population indicates that militants are a politically depleted force.
However, this stand against Islamist insurgency has not completely hindered their efforts, as they have since launched daring attacks on security forces.
There will be little pressure from a financial angle for reform, since the Algerian government projects record hydrocarbon sales in 2004.
Past reforms were required due to strong levels of expenditure and weaker earnings from oil and gas output.
Real GDP growth is expected to remain high at 6.2% in 2004 due to oil and gas industry output, with GDP growth rate projections extending into 2005 at 7.5%.
Overall export earnings are predicted to reach US$32 billion in 2004, a direct result of record high oil prices.
This will send the account surplus up to US$13 billion or 18% of GDP.
The surplus is expected to lessen in 2005 as oil prices level off, but will still remain significant at nearly 14% of GDP.
Algeria has accumulated a cushion of deposits in the central bank substantial enough to cover budgetary and balance of payments financing needs for over two years following any kind of downturn in oil prices.
Consumer Market It is difficult to assess the potential for western consumer goods in Algeria, as the Algerian consumer market has not yet been exposed to Western style marketing techniques.
As the number of working women increases, the demand for ready-made processed products is also increasing.
Traditional cooking habits are not forgotten, but variations on diets and food preparation are slowly being adopted.
As a traditional society, Algerians require traditional methods of product exposure.
While consumers are more familiar with seeing imported products, the combination of low incomes and high consumer prices for these goods has made success difficult.
A positive for the import sector can be seen through the rise in private importers since the economic liberalization that took place in 1997.
Algeria:
Key Algerian exports are dates, wine and potatoes.
Agricultural success is dependent on rainfall and therefore the sector can often suffer in times of drought.
The agriculture sector is growing in importance and size in Algeria.
The Algerian government is seeking to advance the sector through improved agricultural production techniques, a move designed to lessen their dependence on imports.
Mutton and lamb dominate Algerian consumption, closely followed by beef.
Veal, horse and rabbit are also eaten, but in small quantities.
Pork is not marketed in Algeria as it is prohibited by Islam.
Algerian’s are also extensive milk consumers, their needs are estimated at 3 billion liters a year, two thirds of which is imported.
Population Main Cities Algiers Oran Constantine Annaba 1.7 million 800,000 600,000 450,000
While this market is difficult , opportunities exist within the local food processing industry to provide raw and semi- processed goods.
The number of food processors is growing, and they are demanding quality raw materials.
Key processing sectors are dairy and milling.
Many processors prefer to import directly as opposed to buying from a local importer.
Canadian exporters can play a role in directly supplying these processors.
Similarly, the tourist niche also exists.
Canadian exporters of consumer-oriented products
Algeria:
Country Profile Statistical Overview
This ongoing process will call for technical assistance and farm equipment not available in Algeria - these are prospects that would benefit from Canadian involvement and expertise.
Within agriculture, the cereals sector is greatly affected by problems with efficiency and outdated technology.
Durum wheat takes up 43% of the country’s agricultural production area, followed by soft wheat at 19%.
However, government programs have already begun to influence its performance.
Harvests of durum wheat, wheat, barley and oats all increased.
Despite the great seasonal results, cereal imports were required to supplement approximately one third of national cereal requirements.
Trade Algeria reported a trade surplus of US$10.8 billion in 2003.
Exports totaled US$23.8 billion, up over 26% from 2002, while imports increased by over 8%, to US$13 billion.
Hydrocarbons continued to lead exports, at US$23 billion, an increase of 28% over 2002 totals.
Petroleum, natural gas and petroleum products dominate Algeria’s exports at 97% of the whole market.
Trade Agreements Algeria has established a number of trade agreements which are growing in strength.
Most important of these is the Arab Maghreb Union.
Nations party to this agreement include Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Libya and Mauritania.
Bilateral investment agreements are in place between Algeria and France, Italy, Belgium and Spain.
Algeria has maintained lasting ties with France.
Market Access Recent government initiatives in all areas of business are attempting to facilitate easy access to the Algerian market.
The move is part of an effort to bring foreign trade regulations into conformity with WTO standards.
With these standards comes the requirement of import licensing, a licensing regime was intended to be
Canadian market access efforts in 2003 resulted in the Canadian Food Inspection Agency negotiating a certificate for the export of dairy products and bovine semen.
This year Canada hopes to negotiate a certificate for live cattle.
Algerian organizations tend to deal only with foreign partners who have managed to gain their confidence through personal visits, careful follow up, and the ability to honor commitments.
It is often necessary to have previous international experience and to spend large amounts on market development, but the contracts are substantial in terms of length.
Algeria provides great incentive to invest within the country.
Companies established in Algeria that export 100% of production are exempt from taxes and companies exporting 50% of production are exempt from 50% of taxes.
Offerings of reduced customs duties, reduction in social security contributions for Algerian employers from 24.5% to 7%, a three-year exemption from the value added tax on goods and services acquired locally or imported, and exemption on property taxes are all in place to attract FDI.
This attraction has been successful with Algeria second only to South Africa in FDI generation on the African continent.
Canada - Algeria Trade and Investment Algerians take a favourable view of Canada’s international policies, including those toward the developing world.
There is a mutual desire between the two governments to intensify
Canada also provides financial assistance through open lines of credit.
The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) provides financial assistance and counseling to Canadian firms seeking to initiate business activity in Algeria.
Algeria holds the second position in Africa and the Middle East for level of contributions under the program, a strong indication of bilateral interest and support.
Country Profile Statistical Overview
Two-way agricultural trade was valued at $244 million in 2003.
Canada’s exports were valued at $242.3 million, and imports from Algeria were valued at $1.7 million resulting in a positive trade balance of $240.6 million.
Lentils represented 12.6% of the export market, while chickpeas, milk powder and sunflower seeds each represented less than 1% of the total agricultural export market.
Canada imported $955,000 worth of dates from Algeria, $632,000 worth of grape wines and $37,000 worth of both tobacco and olive oil.
Bulk exports decreased from 2002 to 2003, a result of the decrease in wheat exports.
Bulk total exports in 2002 were valued at $323 million, which decreased to $206 million in 2003.
Intermediate goods remained close to 2002 totals, amounting to $35.7 million in 2003.
Exports of consumer goods dropped dramatically from $2.3 million in 2002 down to only $63,685 in 2003.

Israel COUNTRY PROFILE
Economy The Israeli Economy is open and modern, featuring a well developed high tech sector.
With considerable help from foreign aid, government assistance and massive immigration, Israel has developed its economy considerably in the past 25 years.
Over this time, Israel’s economic perspective has shifted towards greater market orientation and an openness to the world economy.
Budget cuts, privatization, investment in infrastructure as well as tax cuts make up an economic reform strategy that has lead to economic growth of 1.2% in 2003.
These fluctuations follow a worldwide economic downturn and slow recovery.
Deterioration in security conditions coupled with an economic slump effected all sectors, especially Israel’s fast growing high tech sector.
Key sectors in the Israeli economy are information and communication technology, environment,
agriculture, biotechnology and transportation.
It is estimated that nearly 33% of the workforce is employed in the services sector, delivering public, community and personal services.
This growth occurred while combating the challenges of: national security, the absorption of immigrants, establishing modern infrastructure and providing quality public services.
However, In 2003 Israel reported a trade deficit of US$6 billion, their lowest deficit since 1991.
In response to this negative balance, the government has established economic reforms, foreign investment incentives such as grants and tax exemptions, as well as free trade agreements with many countries, including Canada.
These reforms seek to address the trade balance, as well as, challenges such as inflation and unemployment.
Unemployment increased to 10.7% in 2003 due to high immigration rates as well as a rise in female participation in the labor force.
During economic downturns families required an additional wage earner - the "added worker" economic phenomenon ensued.
However the 2003 economy displayed promise through a rise in the number of

Most foods on store shelves have a kosher label and those that don’t cater to a very small segment of the population.
The kosher consumer does not shop in stores that sell non-kosher products.
The large consumer chains and many smaller stores therefore do not carry these goods.
The large food processing plants also do not use non-kosher raw material in order to not jeopardize this market segment.
The institutional food market only carries Kosher foods.
By complying with Kosher requirements, exporters maximize market presence and consumer exposure.
Israel has a total land area of 20,770 sq km.
Israel proclaimed its capital Jerusalem, but Tel Aviv is considered the major population, financial, commercial and industrial centre.
The landscape is generally hilly and arid.
The climate is predominantly hot and dry with desert areas in the east and temperate conditions in the west.
There is a significant difference in climate from the winter to the summer.
The overall climate requires a significant amount of land to be irrigated in order to produce agricultural products.
Natural resources include timber, potash, copper ore, natural gas, phosphate rock, magnesium bromide, clays and sand.
Jerusalem is home to the Knesset (legislative body).
However, consumers do purchase specific items in different venues.
Prospective exporters hoping to enter the Israeli market often look to the help of intermediaries experienced in particular markets.
Knowledgeable connected representation is the key to the Israeli marketplace.
Establishing distribution channels with the assistance of reputable representation also serves to minimize risk in a country with a current situation such as Israel.
Israel has a diverse import system with small two to three person operations that contract out distribution, to large companies that offer full marketing and logistical services.
Most importers prefer exclusivity, particularly for new products.
However, large international firms often use multiple importers for distribution.
An exporter to Israel can decide on an agent or distributor depending on the amount of control they wish to have over distribution.
It is also important to keep in mind the strict marking and labeling requirements in Israel (see below).
Also, when traveling to Israel for business pay attention to security.
Travel reports are offered by Foreign Affairs Canada at http://www.voyage.gc.ca . Documentation Standard documentation includes a certificate of origin, a commercial invoice, a bill of lading as well as a kosher certificate.
______________________________________________________________________________ Country Profile:
It is critical that products that are not kosher do not use wording or symbols that could imply that the food is kosher.
For more information consult the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Web site at http://www.inspection.gc.ca - consult section 4.16.
Due to the specific nature of labelling requirements, Canadian exporters are urged to consult with and Israeli authority to ensure all requirements are met.
Trade Agreements The Canada Israel Free Trade agreement (CIFTA) which came into effect on January 1, 1997, improves market access for agri-food products of export interest for both Canada and Israel.
For more information on the Free Trade Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of the State of Israel please consult http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca Israel has developed numerous strong relationships in order to strengthen its position in international markets.
The most crucial agreements being the Free Trade Agreements with the European Union, the United States and the European Free Trade Association.
These agreements place Israel in a free trade partnering position with primary economic regions worldwide.
Such incentives include special grants, as well as tax exemptions determined by geographic location of the investment.
Documents that need to be authenticated must first be notarized in Canada.
The exporter endures no cost by sending the documents to International Trade Canada’s Authentication and Service of Documents branch.
Labelling Requirements Israel demands strict marking and labelling procedures.
The following information should be included on all consumer packaging entering Israel:
• country of origin; name and address of the producer; name and address of the Israeli importer; contents; weight or volume in metric units.
Hebrew must be used.
The Israeli Chambers of Commerce project an increase in foreign investment in 2004 as the US economy is on a slow path to recovery.
Market Access In recent years Israel has placed emphasis on opening up to the world economy through free trade agreements with many countries including Canada.
These measures seek to reduce market barriers and tariffs.
The Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA) implemented in 1997 has helped to double trade since its inception.
CIFTA presently grants duty-free access to Canadian exports of wheat, frozen berries, potato flakes, flour, corn, frozen vegetables and various dried peas and beans.
The Canadian Government has set market access priorities for 2004 to expand CIFTA to include other agricultural products, and secure longer-term opportunities for Canadian agri-food products in areas such as vitamins, potatoes and pet food.
Tariffs The CIFTA improves market access for agri-food products.
Certain CIFTA guidelines for specific agri-food products are as follows:
• annual duty-free tariff rate quotas of 200,000 tonnes of course grains, 9,000 tonnes of malt, 10,000 tonnes of pulse crops.
Value Added Tax Excluding fresh fruit and vegetables, all imported products are subject to a value added tax (VAT) of 18%.
Ministry of Health for drugs, Ministry of Transport for vehicles) Kosher Certificate - required in order for importers to market kosher food products.
Exporters who wish to maximize their market presence should comply with Chief Rabbinate requirements.
Please consult Canadian contacts at the end of this report for Kashrut authorities in Canada.
This agency is also responsible for labelling and packaging requirements.
Plant material must be approved by the Plant Protection and Inspection Agency.
Imported meat must be licensed by the Israel Veterinary Services (IVS) and originate in a processing plant approved by the IVS.
Imported fish require a Certificate of Origin and Hygiene.
Market Constraints Under the rules of the CIFTA, both Canada and Israel have agreed to let their rights and obligations in trade be governed by the agreements under the World Trade Organization.
Agricultural trade between Israel and Canada face a number of barriers in the form of quotas agreed upon in the CIFTA.
Two way agricultural trade was valued at $34 million in 2003.
Canada’s exports were valued at $12 million in 2003 and imports from Israel were valued at $22 million, resulting in a negative agricultural trade balance of $10 million.
Rape or colza seeds for sowing accounted for $2.3 million or 19% of Canada’s agricultural exports to Israel in 2003.
Canada’s other principal exports were lentils (dried, shelled, weathered, skinned or split) $1.4 million.
• confectionary products-chocolates, gum candies, biscuits.
• bakery products-baked snacks and consumer ready dried food items.
Canadian private labels have enjoyed great success in the Israeli market over the past few years.
Canadian private label pet food accounts for 8% of the private label pet food sales in Israel.

Iran Agri-Food Country Profile Statistical Overview August 2004 Forward This information piece is provided to update the statistical information of existing documents on Iran.
Due to recent economic developments an update was deemed necessary.
Economy Iran’s economic structure is comprised of state owned large enterprises, small scale village agriculture and private trading and service business enterprises.
Iran’s large and fast growing population coupled with their hold on the world’s fourth largest oil reserve, make Iran a significant economy.
Oil sales account for over one third of the governments total income.
Natural resources and key sectors within Iran’s economy - as well as areas for opportunity are oil (roughly 10% of world’s oil), gas (15.5% of world’s gas), agriculture, mining and minerals, petrochemicals (output of 13 million ons per year one sixth of country’s non oil exports), information technology, environment and electric power.
Economic indicators reveal that economic growth cannot keep pace with labor force growth and advancing unemployment rates that are set at 16%, but unofficial estimates reach as high as 30%.
Economic growth is a high priority, but one that has proceeded at a reserved pace.
Current Situation Iran’s current situation is highly reflective of two decades of revolution, war and economic struggle.
With most economic activity controlled by an often inefficient state sector, changes in economic structure are solely dependent on the state taking considerable action.
The new five year plan is a step towards a more
On one hand Iran is comprised of a young and economically active population.
A demographic shift has resulted in nearly 50% of the population in the under 20 age category and 70% of the population is under 30.
Demographics Total Population Growth Rate Age Breakdown 0-14 yrs 15-64 yrs 65 yrs and over Life Expectancy Total Male Female 70 million 1.07% 28% 67% 5% 69.5 yrs 68 yrs 71 yrs
Forecast Iran’s current president will likely be unable to advance liberalizing policies before his final term is up in mid-2005, due to many powerful institutions being run by conservative minorities.
Recent parliamentary elections have lead to a conservative majority which will likely to lead to more reliability in government and a likeliness for coherent policy making.
The incoming parliament will stand behind their campaign, and work towards improved living standards.
GDP is anticipated to remain close to 2004 standards in 2005 at about 3.9%, while the average rate of inflation is forecasted to fall from a 2003 rate of 16%, to 15.5% in 2004 decreasing further to 14.7% in 2005.
This is a refreshing downward trend, but inflationary pressures are expected to remain.
Iran’s population is increasing urbanized, with 65% of the population living in larger cities.
Despite perceptions, only 20% of Iran’s total land mass is made up is desert, the remaining area is made up of natural range land, forest, and roughly 20% arable land.
The major constraint to further development of the agricultural sector is not the availability of land, rather the availability of water.
Only 10% of the country receives adequate rainfall for agriculture, irrigating techniques are heavily relied upon to battle limited water supply.
Much of the arable land is used to grow wheat and barley.
Man-made irrigation systems are used in certain areas, while rain-fed and dry farming methods are used in western and north-western Iran.
Iran has become more or less self-sufficient in the production of certain fruits, vegetables and livestock.
A demand for western products and services does exist, and is an increasing trend in the consumer market.
It is deficient marketing, market research, and unreliable distribution methods that are slowing an otherwise forward moving trend.
Brand recognition and advertising will continue to be a problem for imported products in Iran as a number of forms of advertising are banned in the country.
Also, the government is very firm on what products can and cannot be sold to their citizens therefore putting solid restrictions on import opportunities.
While efforts to modernize the retail sector in Iran have provided the country with more modern stores, the urban bazaar has historically been the heart of the Iranian town.
In most areas the bazaar is centrally located and covers a large area with small shops grouped by service or product.
An ideal environment for Iranian’s to practice their widely used bargaining skills.
Other opportunities for Canadian companies include trade in livestock genetics, including breeding stock, semen and embryos.
Also, there exists a demand for new healthful foods, nutraceuticals and halal meat.
There is also a demand for agricultural expertise and consulting management, for technology and equipment for food processing, packing, and quality control.
subsistence agriculture and achieve modernization.
These include dam building, subsidization of irrigation and more governmental transparency.
The key issue is how rapidly the country should open itself to the modernizing influences of the outside world.
The government's last 5 Year Development Plan helped liberalize production and marketing in the sector, allocated foreign exchange at a preferential rate for the import of agricultural machinery and continued to pay subsidies on domestic production.
This plan expires in 2005, but similar priorities are expected to extend into the future.
The Ministry of Agriculture has been urging peasants to consolidate their small, scattered farming plots and to form rural production cooperatives (RPC's).
Optimally, each RPC will cover 2,000 to 92,500 hectares of land and employ 200 to 250 farmers, who will maintain their individual ownership.
While the movement towards RPC's has been slow, it is estimated that by 2022 almost all of Iran's farms will consist of RPC's or large commercial farms.
Despite the importance placed on agriculture, problems plaguing the sector’s development remain, including shortages of water, inefficient irrigation, outdated farm machinery, lack of raw materials, and the common practice of subsistence farming.
The government heavily subsidizes delivered water for irrigation but suspects that high subsidization of the cost of water is a deterrent to its efficient use.
As a result, only about 50% of cultivated land is equipped with full or partial control irrigation.
By far, the largest proportion of irrigated land is for wheat.
Exports totaled US$30 billion while, imports were valued at US$26 billion.
Both exports and imports increased from 2002 and are likely to continue an upward trend for 2004 trade totals.
Oil and gas industry output accounted for 80% of Iran’s total exports in 2003, other top exportable commodities in Iran are chemical and petrochemical products, fruits and nuts, and carpets.
Leading suppliers to Iran are Germany at 11%, Italy at 9%, France at 8%, China at 7% and South Korea at 6.5%.
Trade Agreements Iran’s "Islamic foreign policy" emphasizes support for Muslims globally as well as increasing diplomatic contacts with developing countries.
Syria continues to be a significant trade ally to Iran.
Iran maintains diplomatic and commercial relations with Russia and other former Soviet states.
Both Iran and Russia agree that their national interest is best served if more development occurred in Central Asia.
Country Profile Statistical Overview 2004
This is as a result of deliberate government planning.
However the government does wish to establish outside relations in a continuous effort to modernize the country.
Many opportunities for trade exist in Iran, but interested companies must accept a higher level of risk than would be evident in other countries.
Import barriers in Iran enforce Islamic law, and prohibit numerous commodities including alcohol and pork.
Iran’s import rules and regulations are complex and ever-changing.
Each year the Iranian Ministry of Commerce publishes a new handbook on export and import guidelines.
All imports must be registered with the Ministry of Commerce, from which a general importing license is obtained.
Also, in the majority of cases, the importer must have the approval of the relevant ministry for their commodity.
In order for an Iranian company to be granted the opportunity to import, the product imported must be classified as one of strategic importance (e.g. wheat, edible oil or specific technology).
In the past Iranian government has banned or heavily restricted through high tariffs, the importation of agricultural products that are produced in Iran.
In cases where the country’s production cannot meet domestic demand, such products can be imported into the country with the proper Ministry of Commerce and Agricultural Jihad approval.
Despite recent improvements and ongoing efforts to improve Canadian access to the Iranian market, nearly 80% of the economy is state-owned, making the client - the government.
Procurement policies and complexities can lengthen the trade process considerably.
As privatization slowly proceeds and Canadian-Iranian efforts to facilitate business continue such barriers will likely dissipate.
For the time being, the Government Trading Corporation of Iran (GTC) is affiliated to the Ministry of Commerce and imports essential commodities such as wheat, sugar, rice, crude vegetable oil, fertilizers, frozen chicken and baby milk powder.
These commodities are delivered to the recipient organization(s) and they in turn distribute the commodities inside the country.
This is an internal trade agreement between the Iranian Government and the GTC.
relations are common with diplomatic relations commencing in 1955, ending from 1980-1988 and re-instated in 1988 to present date.
Exchanges will continue in efforts to solidify cultural, bilateral and commercial bonds.
Iranian business people are very keen to find Canadian suppliers for commodities, livestock feed, and certain types of technology and equipment.
Although there is limited potential for Canadian value-added agri-food products at present, it is not due to a lack of market demand, but more to import restrictions and local processing capabilities.
While many trade opportunities exist in other sectors, at present Canadian agriculture and agrifood exports are centered around bulk commodities.
This sector provides the most vast opportunity for Canadian exporters.
In all, it appears Iran’s weaknesses are Canadian strengths, creating a highly-beneficial trade opportunity for Canadian companies.
In 2003, Canadian exports to Iran amounted to $236.8 million, up nearly 40% from 2002, while Iran’s exports to Canada amounted to $63.2 million, up 15% from a year earlier.
Iran ranks 46th as an export market for Canadian goods and 75th as a source of imports into Canada.
Imports from Iran were dominated by carpet and rug mill output accounting for 28% of the total market or $17.8 million.
Non-citrus fruit and tree nut farming output represented 24% of Canadian imports from Iran.
Fruit and vegetable canning, pickling and drying represented 19% of the import market while aerospace products and parts represented 5%.
The 15% increase in Canadian imports from Iran was in most part due to the doubling of the non-citrus fruit and tree nut market.
Soybean exports represented 10% of Canadian exports to Iran, while material handling equipment accounted for 7% of exports, and mining and oil and gas - as well as navigational, measuring and medicinal equipment each accounted for 5% of the market.
The 40% increase in Canadian exports to Iran is partly explained through the $44 million dollar increase in the wheat export market as well as the $15 million dollar increase in material handling machinery exports.
Canada’s exports were valued at $108.6 million, and imports from Iran were valued at $31.3 million resulting in a positive trade balance of $77.3 million.
Wheat dominated exports accounting for 72.5% or $78.7 million of Canada’s agricultural exports to Iran.
This commodity has always been a top export to Iran but amounts can fluctuate form the $370 million exported in 2001 to the $34 million in 2002.
Wheat imports are closely guided by government, these imports are of strategic importance to the country to meet domestic needs, but government closely protects the commodities that are harvested at home, such as wheat.
Intermediate goods also increased from $1.5 million in 2002 to $4.5 million in 2003, while consumer goods exports remained low but fell from $432,000 in 2002 to $313,000 in 2003.

Egypt Past, Present & Future Report February 2007 Overview Egypt‘s population, the largest in the Arab world, has been rapidly growing in recent years, increasing from 64 million in 2000 to 75 million in 2005.
This large, particularly young consumer base holds a growing penchant for North American foods, and ultimately presents great opportunity for Canadian agri-food exporters.
Egypt enjoys a diverse economy backed by a rich supply of natural resources, highly integrated manufacturing capabilities, thriving agricultural sector, attractive tourism industry and skilled labour force.
The country is also home to an expanding middle-aged consumer group and dominant young population that are the driving forces behind the country’s demand for more North American-type packaged, processed and convenience foods, as well as fast food outlets.
Coupled with a rising standard of living and greater disposable incomes, this 15 million-strong consumer group may become an extremely lucrative target market for Canadian agri-food exporters in the future.
Canada-Egypt Relations Canada and Egypt have maintained a positive bilateral relationship since the countries first established diplomatic relations in 1945.
The countries currently share trade, development, educational and cultural partnerships.
Recently, Canada opened an embassy in Cairo symbolizing a closer relationship with Egypt.
Canada continues to be an important destination for many Egyptian immigrants, and as a result, extensive Egyptian-Canadian communities have developed in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.
• Top Canadian exports to Egypt Trade balance $172.3 million Canada-Egypt Ag Trade (2006) $149.2 million include coal (17%), newsprint Exports $140.6 million (16%), and iron ores and Imports $8.6 million concentrates (8%).
Canada-Egypt Bilateral Trade (2005)
•
Agricultural Trade Total agricultural trade between Canada and Egypt has fluctuated over the past several years, but overall increased by 350% from $42.3 million in 2000 to $149.2 million in 2006, largely due to an increase in Canadian exports.
Bulk and intermediate goods consistently represent the majority of Canadian agri-food exports to Egypt.
Such goods comprised almost all Canadian agri-food exports in 2006 at 97%.
Canada’s agricultural exports to Egypt increased by 390% between 2005 and 2006 mainly due to large increases in bulk wheat and durum wheat exports, as well as intermediate milk powder exports.
This rise was largely due to increases in chocolate imports between 2004 and 2005, and growth in olive and vegetable imports between 2005 and 2006.
Plants used in pharmaceutical production have remained Canada’s top imported commodity from Egypt over the past decade and typically account for about 16% of total agri-food imports from Egypt respectively.
Canada’s Top 5 Agricultural Exports to Egypt (2006) Wheat, nes Lentils, dried/shelled Milk powder Soya beans Linseed $102.6 million $15.5 million $5.8 million $4.6 million $2.2 million
Complete statistical summary available at: http://ats.agr.gc.ca/stats/egypt_e.pdf
• Total Canada-Egypt agricultural trade represents approximately 33% or $149.2 million of all trade between the two countries.
Top Canadian exports to Egypt in 2006 included wheat totalling $102.6 million and representing approximately 73% of total agri-food exports, dried and shelled lentils at $15.5 million or 11% of total exports, and milk powder worth over $5.8 million and 4% of exports.
2006 bulk exports to Egypt totalled $112 million, increasing by 1087% from $10.3 million in 2005, while intermediate exports totalled $25.1 million and showed about 7% growth from 2005.
Top Canadian imports from Egypt in 2006 included whey valued at over $1.5 million and making up about 43% of all agri-food imports, products consisting of natural milk valued at almost $580,000 or 16% of total imports, and food preparations totalling almost $300,000 or 8% of such goods.
Other major Canadian agri-food imports included ice cream and unsweetened milk and cream powder, worth over $260,000 and $210,000, or roughly 7% and 6% of total imports respectively.
Economy Major economic and political reforms have transformed Egypt into a more privatized economy over the past 30 years.
Historically, growth has been driven by public sector spending and exports, while domestic consumption and investment showed slower increases.
To accelerate growth, the Egyptian government recently introduced an economic liberalization program.
Reductions in personal and corporate income tax rates to 20%, and energy subsidies, as well as the privatization of several enterprises were implemented between 2005 and 2006.
Such reforms are expected to result in strong future economic growth that will raise the standard of living, and in turn, encourage consumption and investment.
However, Egypt’s fiscal deficit and inflation rate are being stretched as a result of such efforts.
The Egyptian government has identified foreign investment as a critical component to sustained economic growth.
As a result, investors are given special exemptions and incentives, such as the right to send home capital, own foreign currency accounts, and receive equal treatment.
However, several barriers to investment remain including a high level of bureaucracy, complex tax systems and customs procedures, the prohibition of foreigners owning agricultural land in certain regions, and the role of commercial agent and importer or trader being limited to Egyptian nationals.
To offset these obstacles, the Egyptian customs authority is currently addressing its procedures and aims to introduce a pre-clearance system and simplified inspection process, while the state plans to increase privatization and fiscal transparency, and improve tax regulations.
Gross Domestic Product (2006) GDP GDP growth GDP/ capita GDP/ capita (PPP) US$106.2 billion (2006) 6.8% (2007) 6.6% (2008) 5.8% US$ 1,347 US$ 4,175
Current Economic Trends
• GDP reached a value of US$106.2 billion in 2006 and is forecast to reach over US$113.2 billion in 2007.
• The Central Bank has implemented a more consistent monetary management system that has resulted in better control over the inflation rate, and helped to strengthen the Egyptian pound against the United States’ dollar.
Forecasted Economic Trends
• GDP growth is forecast to slow to 6.6% in 2007, and further decrease to 5.8% and 5.1% in 2008 and 2009 respectively.
• Egypt’s future economic expansion is forecast to result in steady employment growth, reducing the unemployment rate from its 2006 level of 10%.
Egypt Country Report:
Consumers at all income levels are willing to spend a large portion of their income on food, as eating is an integral part of Egyptian culture.
Typically, middle- and upper-income families spend 1.5 times more on food and beverages than lower income families.
Food and non-alcoholic beverage expenditure represents the largest consumer expenditure category in Egypt, making up roughly 40% of total expenditure in 2005.
Total consumer expenditure in Egypt was roughly $71 million in 2005; this value has increased by 25% since 2000.
Egyptians typically eat three meals a day, with lunch being the largest, most important meal.
Traditional Egyptian meals include vegetables and rice or pasta.
Meat is also included, depending on affordability.
However, in recent years there has been an increasing interest in North American and European food and beverage products.
Snack food consumption, in particular sweets, salty foods, and carbonated beverages, has shifted away from traditional Egyptian snack foods.
Egyptian consumers are not typically concerned with healthy eating; however, higher-income groups have generally higher levels of awareness about healthy eating, and may choose products with lower fat and cholesterol.
Expansion of fast food chains and hotels and resorts has increased potential for imported goods to enter Egypt’s foodservice market in recent years.
The fast food market is growing tremendously in Egypt, with about 30 North American chains currently located in the country.
A&W, Chili’s, KFC, McDonalds, Hard Rock Café, Little Caesars, Pizza Hut, and TGI Fridays are some examples of North American chains dominating Egypt’s fast food market.
Egypt’s successful and growing tourism industry is also becoming more accommodating of imported food products as tourists are more aware of international food trends.
This industry is seeing large expansion in areas such as Cairo, the Red Coast and Sinai.
There are currently about 170 hotels in Sharm El Sheikh (Red Sea Resort), and this number is expected to increase as the government continues to support investment in hotels and tourist resorts.
More affluent households and single people may eat out at least once a week.
• Egypt has a young population, with over 50% of Egyptians under the age of 25.
In 2005, the median age was 22.6.
Young adults in the older range (23-29), especially those from affluent backgrounds, represent a lucrative consumer market for exporters as this group spends much of their income on entertainment, travelling and dining at restaurants.
Between 1990 and 2015, this group will increase in size by more than 100%.
Middle-aged adults commonly have children and are consumed by increasingly busy lifestyles.
Population Density/Regions
• 90% of Egypt’s population inhabits 10% of the country’s landmass, and are mostly located along the Nile and the Nile Delta.
20% of the population lives in Cairo, with Alexandria and Mansoura following as the next largest cities in Egypt.
Retail Food Market
• There are a growing number of supermarket chains and hypermarkets in Egypt, which are driving consumer demand for new-to-market food and beverage products.
Egypt’s production of beverages (i.e. mineral and bottled water, soft drinks, tea, coffee and alcoholic drinks) are dependant on substantial fruit and vegetable supplies.
Popular and Growing Products
The consumption of bottled water increased by about 50% between 1998 and 2003; this is mostly due to the increasing awareness of poor tap water quality in Egypt.
Most consumers from middle- and upper-income segments are more drawn to using bottled water at home instead of tap water.
75% of soft drinks consumed by Egyptians are carbonated.
The consumption of carbonated beverages increased by more than 15% between 1998 and 2003.
This growth was mainly due to the rising price of red meat in the Egyptian market and the growing variety of fresh fish available to consumers.
Processed cheese:
Although all dried and processed foods have seen increases in the Egyptian food market, processed cheese has had the most success.
From 1998 to 2003, the sale of processed cheese increased by almost 30%.
In comparison, Canadian food exports only account for 1% of Egypt’s imported food market.
Furthermore, the United States and many European countries, specifically France, Germany, Spain and Italy, and South Africa are Egypt’s top suppliers of consumer-ready food products.
Egypt’s trade agreements with various neighbouring countries, the United States and Europe also act as major challenges to Canada’s success in the Egyptian food market.
Egypt has a strong trade relationship with the European Union (EU).
In 2004, Egypt signed and an agreement with the EU effectively lifting barriers to non-agricultural trade to Europe.
Egypt has also joined the Qualified Industrial Zones (QIZ) by signing a trilateral agreement with the United States and Israel.
This agreement is seen as a step toward the signing of a free trade agreement between Egypt and the United States in the future.
The Egyptian government also frequently applies reference prices and high tariffs on certain products such as apples and alcoholic beverages.
Although Egypt has significantly reduced import tariffs, duties on some products are still very high.
For example, most customer-oriented product tariffs are 32%, while some fruit (e.g. apples and pears) still have relatively high rates of 40%.
The Egyptian government is working to increase business activity by attracting foreign investment.
In doing so, the government is introducing reforms on economic, legal and monetary policies, and has introduced incentives and provided additional opportunities for international and bilateral trade.
Free trade zones have also been established in many Egyptian cities.
This has created excellent environments for businesses growth in Egypt’s large urban areas.
Such changes have since provided significant opportunities to foreign companies in accessing the Egyptian market.
The country’s eight main seaports handle approximately 60.5 million tons of goods per year.
Improvements to Egypt’s highways are underway, and telecommunication networks are beginning to reach global standards.
Businesses are closed Friday and Saturday.

Agriculture Sector and Policies Although Egypt spans approximately 1 million km2, its limited arable land and little annual rainfall make the agricultural industry highly dependent on various techniques to increase yield and water supply from the Nile River.
Egypt is well known for its traditional agriculture practices and activities which include basin irrigation, organic manure, crop rotation and intensification.
However, with limited usable land surface and water supply, less than 5% of land is suitable for farming.
Approximately 80% of the nation’s water supply is used for farming and a large portion of this water is provided by the Nile River.
Egypt’s agricultural sector is an integral component of its economy, accounting for 15% of GDP and employing approximately 36% of the population in 2006.
The country’s main agricultural commodities include cotton, rice, corn, wheat, beans, fruit, vegetables, cattle, water buffalo, sheep and goats.
Facing such agricultural challenges, the Egyptian government has put significant effort into implementing various agriculture policies and supporting research programs that increase crop intensification, create more efficient management of resources and agriculture inputs, and reduce negative environmental impacts.
The state recently introduced several policy reforms that ranged from eliminating controls on input and output prices, to a new crop quota structure and delivery system.

Market Information Middle East and North Africa Agriculture Sector - Market Brief - Iran January 2003
Agriculture Iran is currently one of the world's largest net importers of agricultural products, importing 30-50% of its food requirements.
The country's rapid population growth and an increase in disposable income are expected to substantially raise the demand for food over the medium and long-term, and should lead to diversification in agricultural imports.
In the Iranian year 1378 (ended 21 March 2000), the country's agricultural sector accounted for 24.8% of the GNP, 23% of job creation, 21% of non-oil exports, 80% of domestically needed foodstuffs and 90% of the raw materials used in food processing plants.
Agriculture effectively constitutes the backbone of Iranian production, and some 10.2 million hectares of land are under cultivation throughout the country.
The Ministry of Agricultural Jihad's statistics show that annual production in Iran between March 1999 and March 2000 exceeded 65 million tons.
In addition to being the largest producer of saffron and pistachios in the world, Iran is also among the top ten producers of ten other potentially exportable items.
Geographically, Iran is located between 25-40° N latitude and has a total area of 1,648,195 km2, of which 123,580 km2 suitable for agriculture.
The climatic conditions in much of Iran are typical of arid and semi-arid regions, while the Caspian coast is considered subtropical.
Nevertheless, the country has a wide spectrum of climatic, physiographic and hydrological conditions.
However, much of the arable land is devoted to growing wheat and barley, which are staple food and the main sources of protein for the average Iranian.
Wheat alone covers about 50%, while various fruits account for 15% of the total irrigated land in Iran (2000 estimate).
Two farming systems - man-made irrigation and rain-fed (dry farming) - are primarily used in different parts of the country, and the area devoted to each system varies considerably depending on agro-climatic conditions.
Rain-fed and dry farming are most successful in western and northwestern Iran, as well as the lowlands along the Caspian coast.
In other parts of the country, dry farming is also practiced in hilly areas, but the yields are limited.
In the central plateau, as well as the southern plains and the southern coastal areas of Iran, crop production is mostly possible only with irrigation, due to low rainfall and high evaporation rates.
In some low-lying plains in the central plateau, the annual rainfall is about 50mm while the annual evaporation may exceed 4000mm.
The country-wide average precipitation is about 250mm a year.
The table below shows the area of land under cultivation (1996-2001).
Crop year Land under Annual Cops (1,000 hectares)
Of this, about 10.2 million hectares is cultivated (irrigated and rain-fed), while nearly 5.8 million hectares is left fallow every year.
An estimated 32 million hectares of unused land are potentially suitable for crop production, but a shortage of water resources limits their agricultural role.
It is important to take into account that more than half of the country consists of rangeland (generally of low to medium productivity), wasteland, and mountains.
Sand dunes, salt flats, and other non-productive land, found mostly in the central plateau and the southern coastal areas, comprise 11.6 million hectares.
The main crops produced by Iranian farmers are grains such as wheat, rice, and barley.
Due to special programs initiated in the agricultural sector, Iran has become more or less self-sufficient in the production of several farm products, including certain fruits, vegetables, and livestock.
Nevertheless, Iran remains a net importer of foodstuffs, due in part to the drought that has affected the country for the last few years.
The following tables indicate the major sources of Iran's agricultural products and the total import values.
Main Sources of Iranian Agricultural Imports Product Source Country Oil Argentina Brazil Canada U.A.E Oil seeds Canada Brazil U.A.E Netherlands Pulses Canada Pakistan Iraq U.A.E Other agricultural products (wheat, barley, corn, etc.)
Canada Australia Kazakhstan Thailand Argentina
The major importer of wheat is the Government Trading Company (GTC), which has traditionally worked with the GTCs of exporting countries.
However, recently enacted regulations have allowed for private companies' import of raw wheat, as long as it is processed in Iran and then re-exported, with the firm profiting from the added value of the processed product.
Wheat production, like other agricultural activities, currently benefits from large state subsidies, and although the government is planning to reduce their assistance, wheat will be the last to be affected, as it is the staple grain in the diets of most Iranians.
Since the record crop of 3.3 million tons of barley in 1988, acreage and production have been steadily decreasing and imports have increased.
While Canada has sold quantities of barley to Iran in the past, annual exports have not exceeded 200,000 tons since 1989-1990.
For the 1999-2000 fiscal year, domestic barley production decreased to 1.4 million tons, and the following year, Iran imported 1.05 million tons worth US$160 million.
Canada's share of the total barley import during the latter period was 165,500 tons.
Corn has been gaining significance in its use as a feed grain since 1974.
As very little corn is produced domestically, imports have increased at the same pace as feed use.
During 2000-2001, some 1.2 million tons, worth US$151 million, were imported, and Canada's share of the total was 0.38 million tons.
While Iranians consume over 1 million tons of edible oils annually, they produce only about 240,000 tons, therefore requiring a large amount of imports.
Soybean imports are also of significant quantities, and the demand for canola seeds and oil is ever growing.
The estimated 1 million tons of imports come in the form of seeds as opposed to oils, since the government's Third 5-Year Economic Development Plan(1) states that in order to support domestic employment and to economize on foreign exchange reserves, oil seeds or oil cake should be imported instead of processed edible oils.
The various forms of edible oil imported by Iran and the main sources are as follows:
• Soya oil (raw)
• Peanut oil (refined)
• Olive Oil
• Palm Oil (raw)
• Sunflower Oil (raw and refined)
• Cotton seed oil (raw and refined)
• Coconut oil (raw and refined)
• Date seed oil (raw and refined)
• Linseed oil (raw and refined)
• Animal oils Rice:
Rice is an important part of the Iranian diet, and in 1999-2000 it was the fourth largest crop grown in the country in terms of volume.
While production has been steadily increasing from year to year, production in 1999-2000 experienced a slight decrease due to the drought.
While Iran produces dry beans, chickpeas, lentils and millet, though imports are required when production is not sufficient.
The country's pulse market amounts to 512,000 metric tons per year, valued at approximately US$500 million.
The annual production of various crops in Iran (1997-2000) is indicated in the table below.
Source Country Wheat Barley
Although traditionally migratory tribes have maintained large herds of sheep and goats and small farms have produced both meat and milk, the higher demand for meat has prompted a move toward the widespread establishment of large-scale industrial farms.
Domestic production of meat (lamb, chicken, beef and goat) totals almost 2 million tons annually, which is all but sufficient to meet internal demand.
However, some imports of various types of meat (excluding pork) are allowed in order to maintain price stability.
In addition, with the continued expansion of industrial farming both for dairy and meat production, the need for genetic materials has also increased significantly.
The following points indicate Iran's potential for attracting foreign involvement.
• There are several large-scale, state-owned agricultural enterprises that can be offered to the local or foreign private sector.
• Export opportunities available to foreign companies (investors) are enhanced by Iran's geographic location and the fact that agriculture in the surrounding regions (Persian Gulf States, Caucasus and Central Asian Republics) has not traditionally flourished.
• Imports of seeds, pesticides and agricultural machinery help create foreign investment opportunities.
• An ever-increasing need to upgrade technical knowledge, improve quality and increase productivity set the stage for foreign involvement.
• There are excellent opportunities for foreign companies in Iran's agriculture sector, including the establishment of irrigation and forestation systems.
• In the past two decades, the Iranian government has put emphasis on supporting the industry and is determined to continue to do so in the future.
Foreign companies, by forming joint ventures with Iranian entities, can also benefit from other services such as bank loan privileges and export tax exemptions.
Bank services related to agriculture are usually rendered through Bank Keshavarzi.
The interest this bank charges is the lowest, when compared to the rates charged to the country's other economic activities, such as construction, industry and services.
The Third 5-Year Economic Development Plan (2000-2005) specifies that the government should allocate 25% of bank loans provided for Iran's development, to the water and agriculture sectors.
Foreign manufacturers of agricultural equipment and machinery can export their products to Iran or, in partnership with Iranian firms, can produce or assemble their products within the country.
Imports are not generally encouraged by the Iranian government and can be subject to high taxes, tariffs and charges.
In addition, in order to realize maximum growth - a point stipulated by the Plan for the water and agriculture sectors - the following factors should be given priority:
• The provision of agriculture machinery and improving the efficiency of existing machinery and equipment, thereby easing and eventually eliminating the mechanization crisis.
• The construction of water pump stations to be designed using the latest technological and engineering techniques.
The above clearly indicates that there are opportunities for foreign investors and companies to introduce their products and technology to Iran.
However, if the country's production cannot meet domestic demand, products can be imported into the country with the approval of the Ministries of Commerce and Agricultural Jihad.
The import of agricultural machinery is also allowed, but is conditional to the fact that the Ministry of Commerce has issued the relevant permits.
At the moment, there are only few items, e.g. opium, whose import is prohibited by law.
Nevertheless, the Third Development Plan states "In order to create employment opportunities and reduce foreign currency expenses, the government shall be duty-bound to import oil seeds into the country, instead of the imports of cooking oil and oil cake".
In addition, the Ministry of Agricultural Jihad has the power to stop issuing, or rescind, import permits if it deems such action appropriate.
The export of agricultural products can be subject to some limitations if the producer has been provided with subsidies.

The Iranian government's development policy has revolved around a series of Five-Year Plans.
Dating back to the 1950's, these plans are known to be extremely macro-oriented and centrally planned, aimed at achieving targeted outputs and expenditures.

MARKET OVERVIEW Israel offers a sophisticated and diversified market for agri-food products.
The United States accounts for approximately 30% of agri-food imports.
Canada is currently Israel's top supplier of dried leguminous vegetables and among the top three suppliers of soybeans and pet food.
Approximately 80% of Israel's domestically produced agriculture goods come from two types of co-operative agriculture settlements: the kibbutz, a collective entity based on co-operative principles; and the moshav, a village of family businesses in which each household earns money from their own products but work as a collective co-operative when purchasing and marketing products.
Israel has a large and sophisticated food-processing industry that provides a broad array of food products.
The leading manufacturers include Tnuva Food Industries, Elite Industries Ltd., Osem, Strauss Dairies, Israel Edible Products (TAMI), Tivall and the Meir Ezra Group.
The Israeli food market is moving toward a trend in convenience as evidenced by the many Israelis who are eating more prepared foods, fast foods, and snacks.
Demand for prepared and packaged food products is therefore strong throughout the country.
With continued growth projected for the private-label industry, significant opportunities exist for Canadian manufacturers in nearly all product categories.
The Canada Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA) which came into effect on January 1, 1997, improves market access for agri-food products of export interest to both Canada and Israel.
Canada's goals are to expand coverage of the CIFTA and secure longer-term opportunities for Canadian agri-food products in key areas such as vitamins, potatoes and pet food.
Israel has a liberal import policy and has entered into free trade agreements (FTAs) with several countries other than Canada, including: the Czech Republic, the European Free Trade Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), the European Union, Hungary, Mexico, Poland, Romania, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Turkey and the United States.
Import licences have been eliminated, although imported food items require the approval of the Ministry of Health's Food Inspection Service.
This agency is also responsible for labelling and packaging requirements.
All plant material requires approval from the Plant Protection and Inspection Agency.
Imported meat must be licensed by Israel Veterinary Services (IVS) and originate from a processing plant that has been approved by the IVS.
Israeli law requires all meat and poultry imports be certified kosher(3) by the Rabbinical Council of the Chief Rabbinate, or a body authorized by the council.
Hence, goods can receive kosher certifications from rabbis in Canada but only with the concurrence of the Chief Rabbinate.
Kosher is an important consideration in the export of food to Israel.
With over 60% of the country's five million Jewish population maintaining some degree of Kosher observance and a Moslem population of one million purchasing Kosher food that meets the halal dietary requirement, Israel is the largest market in the world for kosher food.
Although the import of non-kosher food is not forbidden, marketing would be limited to a small segment of the market.
The large food chains, processing plants and institutional market import only kosher food.
Non kosher foods account for less than 5% of the total food market.
Exporters who wish to maximize their market presence should comply with the Chief Rabbinate requirements.
Israel has strict marking and labelling requirements.
All labels must be in Hebrew and any English lettering appearing on the label must not be larger than the Hebrew characters.
Imported food products are subject to standards issued by the Standards Institution of Israel (SII) and the Ministry of Health's Food Control Services.
With the exception of fresh fruits and vegetables, all imported products are subject to a value added tax of 18%, which is levied on the cost, insurance and freight, landed cost plus purchase tax.
Good representation is the key to the Israeli market.
Prospective exporters are recommended to use the services of a local representative/distributor or local agent who has a thorough knowledge of the market and is well connected with key players.
For assistance in locating an agent or distributor, contact the Canadian Embassy in Israel.
For more information on import regulations, see the Israel Agri-Food Market Report available online at: www.infoexport.gc.ca
OPPORTUNITIES Canadian agri-food products are well-positioned to penetrate the Israeli market.
A significant number of Canadian food manufacturers produce kosher food products including bakery products and ingredients, confectionery products, fish (especially salmon), soybean meal, honey, and packaged food products and meals.
In addition to pulses, non-durum wheat, barley, and soya beans, which Canada has traditionally exported to this market, there are numerous and varied opportunities in the following areas:
• prepared foods-cereals, health snacks, savoury snacks, sauces, spreads
• fish and seafood products-high-quality fish such as salmon, sole and seafood for the restaurant market
• confectionery products-chocolates, chewing gum, candies, sweet biscuits
• bakery products-prepared snacks, consumer-ready dried food products
• frozen meals, frozen fruits, especially frozen berries for the dairy industry
• wines-market demand has risen substantially.
Canadian wine--especially ice wine--is well-placed to develop a market share in Israel.
The private-label market offers opportunities as well.
Private labels represent 5% of the major supermarkets volume and is expected to double within the next year.
Canada's "President's Choice" private label has enjoyed considerable success in the Israeli market over the past several years.
KEY PARTICIPANTS In recent years, a number of multinational firms such as Nestlé, Pillsbury, Best Foods, Unilever, Yoplait, Danone, Knorr and Cadbury Schweppes PLC have successfully entered the market through licensing agreements or in partnership with local food producers.
Canadian companies have a solid presence in the Israeli agri-food market and have developed an excellent reputation as dependable suppliers.
In addition, Canadian companies have also made significant inroads into the Israeli private-label market over the past few years.
Solid examples abound on the shelves of Clubmarket, one of Israeli's largest food chains, which sources a significant array of President's Choice (PC) private label brand from Canada.
Canada's main competitors in Israel are the European Union, which accounted for 39% of total food imports in 2001and the United States (24%).
However, new trading partners such as Turkey and countries from the former Soviet Union have significantly increased their trade with Israel in recent years.
The United States has traditionally maintained a strong presence in the Israeli agri-food market, having tariff advantages over some Canadian agri-food products.
PRIVATE- AND PUBLIC-SECTOR CUSTOMERS Israel has a diverse import system, ranging from small two to three persons operations that contract out distribution, to large companies offering full marketing and logistical services.
Most importers prefer exclusivity, particularly for new products.
However, large international firms often use multiple importers for distribution.
With approximately 60% of the market share, Israeli supermarkets dominate Israel's retail food sector.
Israel's leading supermarket chain is Super-Sol Ltd. which operates over 140 stores throughout Israel.
The chain operates a variety of supermarket formats including Cosmos and Super-Sol, which are large urban supermarkets; Hyper-Netto, discount food stores; Seven Universe Club, club-member superstores; and Birkat Rachel, a discount chain of supermarkets specializing in kosher products for Israel's ultra orthodox community.
SuperSol purchases most of its imports from Israeli importers but operates one central distribution centre from which they deliver products to various stores in the chain.
Blue Square Ltd., Supersol's major competitor, has over 170 stores in Israel including 12 Mega hypermarket outlets.
Other retail formats run by the chain include Super Centre, the company's discount supermarket chain; King- Centre, a smaller version of hard discount-format retail centres; Super Centre City, neighbourhood stores based on the Super Centre model, and Co-Op, medium-sized convenience stores (generally found in Tel Aviv).
Like Super-Sol's Birkat Rachel, Blue Square's Shefa Mehadrin chain also caters to Israel's ultra-orthodox population.
The chain purchases most of its imports from Israeli importers although some high-volume, high turnover items, which do not demand a long warehousing period, are imported directly.
With over 160 stores, Clubmarket Ltd. is Israel's third-largest food chain.
Like its competitors, it operates several retail formats including Clubmarket, its flagship discount supermarket chain; Co-Op, a large chain of convenience stores; Hyperzol, chain of discount stores; Glatmarket, discount food stores targeted to ultra-orthodox consumers; Metro, mega-store specializing in discount wholesale trading; Rav Mecher discount retail stores; Jumbo, large hypermarkets, and Franchisees, a sub-chain of small neighbourhood stores operated via franchisees.

MARKET OVERVIEW Biopharmaceuticals is the most significant sector of the Israeli biotechnology market.
Domestic biotechnology companies focus mainly on product development for cancer, auto-immune syndromes and neurology disorders and to a lesser extent, on food, cosmetics and environmental products.
About 50% of university research projects in therapeutics and 66% of biotech drugs in the pipeline are in the areas of auto-immune diseases, neurology and cancer.
Pharmaceutical and diagnostics firms represent 72% of the Israeli biotechnology industry, agricultural biotechnology accounts for 20%, and the remainder includes veterinary and environmental applications.
Sales revenues of biotechnology industry are estimated at $2.6 billion(1) in 2003.
Investments in Israel were estimated at $1.4 billion.
Furthermore by 2010 Israel is expected to account for 3% of the global biotech market.
There is strong government support for the biotechnology industry within Israel through programs to match research funding, establish technology incubators, and encourage bi-national cooperation.
However, Israel lacks regulatory infrastructure.
Despite a rapidly expanding medical and pharmaceutical industry, the Israeli market is dependent on imported goods.
The pharmaceutical market, including generic drugs, was valued at $1.7 billion in 2002, 50% of which were imported drugs.
Israel's biotechnology industry is still in its infancy with 150 companies, including about 40 incubator projects and approximately 3500 employees.
The majority of the companies focus on biopharmaceuticals.
Three quarters of the companies are small start-ups with less than 20 employees while a dozen companies represent 80% of the total market value of the industry, generate two thirds of sales and employ about 50% of the industry's workforce.
In the last decade, the number of companies increased by an average of 17% per year, while the sales generated by the sector grew by 27% per year.
The challenge for the industry will be to move to the next phase of growth in which it nurtures more broadly based companies, supported by the physical, regulatory and scientific infrastructure necessary for long term growth.
The Ministry of Science, Culture and Sports(2) and the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of Industry and Trade supports the Israeli biotech industry by providing long-term financial support for research and development (R&D) projects to biotech companies, enhancing cooperation between academia and industry to ward the commercialization of Israeli biotechnology worldwide, by encouraging international strategic cooperation and by assisting start-ups through a variety of support activities including incubators.
In the life sciences field, there are seven universities, five technical colleges and ten specialized research institutes engaged in advanced biotechnological research.
An estimated 35% of all academic scientists in Israel work in the life sciences field and spend 40-50% of all academic research funding.
As a result, Israel has one of the world's most skilled and educated work forces, with more doctors, scientists and engineers per capita than any other nation.
Israel has a highly diverse population as a result of years of immigration, providing researchers with a heterogenous population for clinical trial research.
Lower costs for conducting clinical trials and a history of bringing new products to an advanced stage of development more rapidly than anywhere else in the world, makes Israel an attractive place for foreign companies to conduct clinical trials or establish research partnerships.
Opportunities There are good opportunities in this market for Canadian companies interested in R&D partnerships and technology transfer agreements to take advantage of Israel's research strengths.
Areas where major advances in biotechnology have been made include the use of molecular modeling to design new and improved drugs, synthetic polyamino acids for drug development, drug delivery techniques and drug design by peptide modification.
Israel needs to invest further in the essential infrastructure to compete in the post-genomic era, especially in basic research infrastructure and early stage commercialization.
Currently, Israeli biotechnology firms tend to sell their early stage technology to international investors or multinational concerns, rather than take the risk to develop the product further.
There is scope for combining Canadian and Israeli talents where Canadian biotechnology companies can form strategic partnerships with Israeli companies, both at the pre- and post-commercialization stages.
Due to insufficient industrial infrastructure facilities for drug development and testing, there are market opportunities for Canadian companies to provide these services.
Canadian companies can also work co-operatively with Israeli companies to conduct clinical trials in Israel where there is a high level of medical expertise, lower costs and a diverse population base.
The Canada-Israel Industrial Research Development Foundation (CIIRDF) provides companies in either country with an introductory service for the purpose of creating R&D alliances.
The program contributes half of the costs of joint R&D projects (up to $50 000 over one year for approved pilot projects and up to $750 000 over three years to fund approved full-scale projects) for eligible Canadian or Israeli firms operating and headquartered in either Canada or Israel.
At least 30% of the cash cost of any individual project must be spent in either Canada or Israel, contributions are repayable from commercial revenues from the project.
For further information, Canadian companies should contact CIIRDF.
Canadian companies interested in research and development relationships with Israeli companies are encouraged to consult the MATIMOP program.
MATIMOP (Israeli Industry Center for Research and Development) is a public non-profit organization that promotes joint industrial development of advanced technologies.
The program's Web site (http://www2.matimop.org.il) contains a database outlining co-operative program opportunities that span a range of advanced technologies.
Key Trade Shows BIO-TECH ISRAEL May 4-6, 2004 - Israel's 3rd National Biotechnology Week (http://www.kenes.com/biotech/prog.htm). The exhibition has always attracted large numbers of exhibiting companies representing the entire spectrum of biotechnology related products and services.
The Bio-Technology Conference and the Exhibition will be held at the David-Intercontinental Hotel, Tel Aviv.
For more information, contact the Canadian Embassy.
KEY PARTICIPANTS Israel is expected to become a major centre for the development of pharmaceuticals, especially generic brands.
However, in spite of recent growth, the Israeli pharmaceutical market remains relatively small and the Israeli biotechnology industry has yet to achieve the level of the development of its international competitors, particularly in the United States, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom.
The two main producers and importers of biopharmacuticals are Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, and Agis Industries which together have a combined market share in Israel of 50%-60%.
Other major biotechnology companies in Israel include Biotechnology General (BTG), Pharmos, Interpharm (IPL) and Compugen.
PRIVATE-AND PUBLIC-SECTOR CUSTOMERS In 1998, Israel reformed its drug import regulations to include major changes in pricing, importing and approvals for new drugs.
For example, medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medical Regulations Agency will be approved by the Ministry of Health in Israel much more quickly than those that have not received such approval.
The FDA and the Israel Ministry of Health have signed a Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) to enable full acceptance and recognition by the FDA of clinical trials conducted in Israel for new drugs and medical devices.
Despite objections from international biopharmaceutical companies, Israel has allowed parallel drug imports since September 2000.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Israeli biotechnology market is a small, emerging market with an estimated value of $1.7 billion1.
The industry comprises 160 companies and employs 4000 people.
In 2001, Israel's biotech sector received approximately $428.6 million in venture capital, an increase of 42% from 2000.
Israel's biotech strengths are in therapeutic pharmaceuticals, bio-informatics, agro-bio (animal and plant products) and diagnostics.
Israel has a highly diverse population, providing researchers with a heterogenous population for clinical trial research.
Lower costs for conducting clinical trials and a history of bringing new products to an advanced stage of development more rapidly than anywhere else in the world make Israel an attractive place for foreign companies to conduct clinical trials or establish research partnerships.
The best prospects for growth in the Israeli biotech industry are in bio-electronics, pharmacogenomics, proteomics, bio-informatics and structure-based drug design.
Opportunities are also available in the growing agricultural biotech sector, where research is focussed primarily on the development of seeds and transgenic plants.
Fish cultures and algae are also growing research areas.
Prospective exporters are recommended to use the services of a local representative/distributor or local agent who has a thorough knowledge of the market and is well-connected with key players.
MARKET OVERVIEW Israel offers a sophisticated and diversified marketplace for goods and services.
Despite its relatively small population of six million people, Israel is still a country with a high volume of imports (both raw materials and finished goods).
The Israeli biotechnology market was worth an estimated $1.7 billion in 2001 and is forecast to reach $2.9 billion by the end of 2003, with continued growth expected over the long term.
In 2001, Israel's biotech sector received approximately $428.6 million in venture capital; an increase of 42% from 2000.
The Israeli government strongly supports the biotech industry with programs to match research funding, establish technology incubators and encourage international cooperation.

Realizing its Full Potential," 2002.
Downloaded from www.irc.org.il/biotech/Vernia.htm on February 12, 2003 The Israeli biotech industry has yet to achieve the level of maturity and development of its competitors, particularly when compared to the United States, Canada, Germany or the United Kingdom.
The potential for progress, however, is significant because of strong government support and the emergence of several large- and medium-sized firms with sufficient infrastructure to develop and test new products.
The Office of the Chief Scientist (OCS) of the Ministry of Industry and Trade2 as well as the Ministry of Science, Culture and Sport are responsible for biotech development in the country.
Although there are several academic and research institutes in Israel, most of the country's biotech research and development (R&D) is centred around the Weizmann Institute of Science and four universities:
Agricultural Biotechnology Agricultural and veterinarian products account for 23% of the biotech market in Israel and over 40% of country's total biotech exports are in agricultural biotechnology.
Approximately 80% of research in this sector is devoted to plant biotechnology, particularly the development of seeds and transgenic plants as well as bio-pest control.
The remaining 20% is focussed on veterinarian biotechnology.
Although genetically modified (GM) crops and food products are a significant topic of public debate in Israel, the government has not yet issued a policy on GM organisms.
A number of domestic companies are active in agricultural biotechnology including Abic BioBee, AgroGreen, Hazera, Gedera, Rahan Meristem, Vitality and Zeraim.
Most agricultural research is conducted at the Volcani Institute and the Hebrew University Faculty of Agriculture.
Diagnostics Diagnostics account for 4% of Israel's biotech market but is expected to grow in the coming years.
Most of this area of biotechnology is focussed on immunological and genetic assays for pathogens.
Leading local companies include Gamida-Gen, Orgenics, Rahan Meristem and Savyon.
Medical Biotechnology Biopharmaceuticals are the most significant sector of the Israeli biotech market.
However, the distinction between traditional pharmaceutical firms and those employing biotechnology in the development of medical products is difficult to establish.
Therapeutic pharmaceuticals account for 67% of total biotech sales in the country.
The three leading therapeutic areas in Israel include neurology disorders, cancer and auto-immune systems disorders; approximately 66% of biotech drugs produced are in these areas.
Other products under development currently include recombinant heparanase, cell therapies for spinal cord traumas, human monoclonal antibodies, structurally shaped peptides and new drug generations.
There were 36 domestic firms working in this sector in 2001.
Leading companies include Pharmos, Peptor Ltd., Insight, Omri, XTL Pharmaceuticals, Teva Pharmaceuticals, D-Pharm, QBI Enterprises, Keryx Biopharmaceuticals and Proneuron Biotechnologies.
With sales totalling $87 million annually, Swiss-owned InterPharm is the leading multinational in Israel's biopharmaceutical market.
In spite of a rapidly expanding medical industry, the Israeli market is still quite dependent on imported goods.
Imported pharmaceuticals accounted for approximately 50% of the $1.7 billion market in 2001.
Imports primarily originate from the United States, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and the United Kingdom; Canadian imports have had a marginal share of about 1% in recent years.
Key Factors Shaping Market Growth Despite a thriving venture capital sector and a world-renown academic infrastructure, Israel's full potential in biotechnology has not been realized.
However, the biotech industry is now on the government's national agenda and a strategy has been devised to support its growth over the next 10 years.
There is strong government support for the biotech industry within Israel through programs to match research funding, establish technology incubators3 and encourage international co-operation.
According to the Israeli Industry Center for Research and Development (MATIMOP), the Office of the Chief Scientist has established priority areas for the new biotech initiative:
• establishing two world-class incubators dedicated solely to biotechnology;
• improving and expanding the industry's physical infrastructure; and
• providing funding, through the OCS-run NOFAR program4.
Israel has a highly diverse population as a result of years of immigration, providing researchers a heterogenous population for clinical trial research.
Lower costs for conducting clinical trials and a history of bringing new products to an advanced stage of development more rapidly than anywhere else in the world make Israel an attractive place for foreign companies to conduct clinical trials or establish research partnerships.
Opportunities The Israeli biotech market is a small, emerging market that holds significant opportunities for Canadian companies, especially in strategic partnering with Israeli biotech companies for joint R&D and international marketing.
Analysts predict that by the end of 2003, the number of biotech companies in Israel will jump from 160 to as many as 250.
Israel is expected to become a centre for the development of biopharmaceuticals and generic medications.
The best prospects for growth in the industry are in bioelectronics, nanotechnology, pharmacogenomics, proteomics, bio-informatics and structure-based drug design.
The growing agricultural biotech sector also holds potential for Canadian companies.
Genetically developed hybrid seeds for fruits, vegetables and cotton, as well as fish cultures and algae are currently the main areas of research.
Currently, Israeli biotech firms tend to sell their early-stage technology to international investors or multinational concerns, rather than take the risk to develop the product further.
Combining Canadian and Israeli talents could see additional development in both countries within this sector.
Canadian companies interested in fostering R&D relationships with Israeli companies are encouraged to consult the Web site of the Israeli Industry Center for Research and Development (MATIMOP).
MATIMOP is a public non-profit organization that promotes collaborations for the development of advanced technologies.
The Web site www.matimop.org.il contains a database outlining co-operative program opportunities that span a range of advanced technologies.
COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT Local Capabilities In the life sciences field, there are seven universities, five technical colleges and ten specialized research institutes engaged in advanced biotechnological research.
An estimated 35% of all academic scientists in Israel work in the life sciences field and approximately 60% of Israeli scientific publications are focussed on agricultural or health-related fields.
As a result, Israel has one of the world's most skilled and educated work forces, having more doctors, scientists and engineers per capita than any other nation.
Areas where major advances in biotechnology have been made include the use of molecular modelling to design new and improved drugs, synthetic polyamino acids for drug development, drug delivery techniques and drug design by peptide modification.
Israel accounts for 2.5% of biotech sales in the world and is second only to the United States in terms of new, start-up biotech companies.
International Competition Israel has signed international co-operation agreements with governments from Canada, Singapore, the United States, the United Kingdom and Korea to encourage collaboration for biotech R&D.
Canadian Position Canadian biotech companies are well-positioned to provide joint-venture partnerships, public education initiatives, and commercialization expertise to the Israeli biotech industry, as well as a broad range of products resulting from Canada's R&D efforts.
Canada's strengths in applying biotechnology to agricultural commercialization may be of interest to Israeli producers and researchers.
The Canadian agricultural biotech industry has already received government approval for a number of genetically altered products.
Several Canadian companies have found success in the Israeli biotech market through collaborations with local companies:
• Montreal-based Q-biogene and BioLabs of Jerusalem have together developed a reagent kit for use in gene therapy research;
• Diagnocure (Quebec City) and Compugen (Tel Aviv) are collaborating on the development of a nucleic acid, probe-based diagnostic kit for early detection of lung cancer;
• Bioxel Pharma (Quebec City) and Jerusalem-based Polygene are developing polymeric implants for the delivery of anti-cancer drugs to localized tumor sites; and
• Mikro-Tech (Timmins, Ontario) and Rahan Meristem (Kibbutz Rosh Hanikra) entered into a joint venture to improve the quality of plants propagated from seed or from tissue cultures.
Competitive Advantage through Canadian Government Policies and Initiatives Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement The 1997 Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement (CIFTA) improves market access for products of export interest to both Canada and Israel and eliminates virtually all tariffs on industrial goods.
It has partially restored Canada's competitive position in the Israeli market, where the United States and European Union have gained preferential access through negotiated bilateral agreements.
Canadian exports have increased by 30% since the CIFTA came into effect.
Canada-Israel Industrial Research and Development Foundation The Canada-Israel Industrial Research and Development Foundation (CIIRDF), established in 1994 to promote collaborative, bilateral R&D, helps Canadian companies create bilateral links with Israeli partners.
A critical connection to accelerate this new strategy will be made in Israel, courtesy of the MAGNET program.
In the identified technology areas, CIIRDF will prepare step-by-step roadmaps and organize annual Canada-Israel roundtables aimed at identifying priority opportunities for co-operative projects.
Canadian Commercial Corporation The Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC) gives Canadian companies access to financing and better payment terms under the Progress Payment Program (PPP).
Activity costs are shared on a pre-approved, 50/50 basis.
The PEMD refundable contribution ranges from $5000 to a maximum of $50 000.
Preference is given to companies with fewer than 100 employees for a firm in the manufacturing sector and 50 in the service industry, or with annual sales between $250 000 and $10 million.
Other components of the program include international bid preparation (Capital Projects Bidding) and, for trade associations, developing international marketing activities for their membership.

Virtual Trade Commissioner The Virtual Trade Commissioner (vTC) is a new on-line service offered by Canada's Trade Commissioner Service of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.
The vTC offers registered users direct on-line access to market information, including market reports, business news, events and business leads related to the companies' industry sectors and markets of interest.
Canadian exporters can register for a Virtual Trade Commissioner at www.infoexport.gc.ca.
PRIVATE-SECTOR CUSTOMERS Israel's 630 privately owned pharmacies represent the second-largest group of customers for pharmaceutical products (the publicly funded health-care system is the primary customer).
The two largest drug store chains are SuperPharm and NewPharm.
The public sector consumes 90% of both imported and locally produced pharmaceuticals.
Since 1995, health insurance is guaranteed to all Israeli citizens.
All residents are required to register with one of the health-care organizations, which provide a standard and extensively subsidized selection of health services and drugs through one of four public "sick funds".
The largest of the sick funds, Kupat Holim Clalit, is the primary purchaser of drugs in Israel.
The other sick funds include Macabi, Leummit and Meuhedet.
The country's sick funds account for approximately 80% of total pharmaceutical expenditure in Israel; the remaining 20% is divided among the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Health and the private sector.
Government Organizations The Ministry of Health is responsible for Israel's overall health policy and for providing direct services to the public through the operation of autonomous heath-care units.
Participation at annual trade fairs can help to develop company and product exposure to this market segment.
Eilat is home to the country's only free-trade zone.
All major ports offer good-quality warehousing but growing demand has rendered capacity problems.
Israel has 610 kilometres of standard gauge railway and 15 965 km of highways.
There are eight main airports located primarily in the largest cities; Ben-Gurion International Airport is the largest.
Channels of Distribution Good representation is the key to success in the Israeli market.
Prospective exporters are recommended to use the services of a local representative/distributor or local agent who has a thorough knowledge of the market and is well-connected with key players.
Importers, Agents and Distributors Exporters new to the Israeli market are advised to appoint a local agent that has an understanding of the local market, good contacts with the Ministry of Health, the sick funds and other major players, and the ability to promote products effectively.
There is an unspoken understanding and trust within Israel's business community that welcomes foreign partners and sales, but looks for a local who "knows you."
An importer of pharmaceutical products must have a licence and be a resident of Israel, or be a representative of a corporation registered in Israel.
As a result, Canadian companies must either establish an office in Israel, or hire a distributor for their products.
For assistance locating an agent or distributor, contact the Canadian Embassy in Israel.
Many other languages are also spoken.
The business environment is westernized but likely to be less formal in both dress (especially during the summer months) and the use of first names without titles.
Increasingly, businesses are moving toward a five-day working week, from Sunday until Thursday.
Common office hours are from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. Sunday to Thursday and from 8 a.m. until 1 p.m. on Friday.
The financial sector is modern and efficient with a full range of financial institutions and instruments.
There are few restrictions on foreign investment and investors and the regulatory environment and tax system favour foreign companies and investors.
The Consular Affairs Bureau of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade's (DFAIT) provides country-specific travel information reports and advisories at www.voyage.gc.ca/destinations/menu_e.htm. Canadians travelling to Israel should pay particular attention to their personal security and follow news reports carefully, as the security situation can change rapidly.
Import Regulations The Government of Israel requires that food and health products be registered with the Ministry of Health before they can be sold in the country.
Sanitary regulations are governed by mutual agreements under membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO).
The Ministry of Health imposes strict controls on the importation of pharmaceuticals.
Medical drugs and substances for their preparation may be imported only through a licence holder who is either an Israeli resident or a representative of a company registered in Israel.
To obtain a licence, a Registration of Medicinal Products must be submitted to the Ministry of Health.
Since 1998, there has been a concerted effort to speed up the approval process for drugs imported from Canada, the United States, the European Union, Japan and Australia.
Accordingly, drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medical Regulation Agency will be licensed by the Ministry within two months, rather than the usual four-month period.
Free trade agreements have been signed by Israel with the European Union (1975), the United States (1985), the European Free Trade Alliance (1992) and Canada (1997).
Under these agreements, there are no custom duties on pharmaceutical imports from these trading partners.
Most imports are free of licensing and quantitative restrictions.
All imports are subject to a 15% cost, insurance, freight value port fee, as well as a 18% value-added tax (VAT).
The VAT is recovered by the importer upon the resale of the goods and is paid ultimately by the consumer, in the final retail price.
The Israeli government has not yet issued a formal policy on GM organisms (GMOs).
However, the country follows the European model for GMO labelling, whereby products containing over 1% of protein or DNA from a modified organism must be labelled as such.
Intellectual Property Protection Israel is a member of the World Intellectual Property Organization, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, the Patent Co-operation Treaty, the Universal Copyright Convention and the Berne Copyright Convention.
As a member of the WTO, Israel complies with the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement.
Patents Israeli patent laws protect both the process and the product and is granted for 20 years from the date of the application, subject to payment of renewal fees.
The owner of a patent must provide a local address when applying for a patent and the title must appear in both Hebrew and English (specifications, however, may be in either English or Hebrew).
The "first to file" principal applies, whereby the first or prior use of a patent does not protect the owner from infringement by someone else who applies first for a patent in Israel.
The use of the services of a patent attorney is recommended.
Generic Drugs Through 1998 and 1999, Israel amended its patent laws to permit domestic manufacturers of generic drugs to develop generic versions of patented drugs prior to the expiration of the 20-year patent protection for the innovator.
While the laws restrict production for use in research and for filing applications to regulatory authorities, Israel has no effective safeguards to restrict commercial exports.
The Israeli pharmaceutical market relied previously on licensed technology from foreign companies, or had to license their technology to large-scale manufacturers.
Israeli generic drug manufacturers have now become large enough to undertake the commercial development of pharmaceuticals.
These companies are opposed to any delay in R&D until after the full period of patent protection has expired.
The revised Israeli patent laws allow Israeli generic alternatives to be marketed as soon as the patent expires, when Israel's competitors would only be starting development of alternatives.
This gives Israeli companies a jump start on generic drug competitors, and generally results in Israeli generic manufacturers gaining a larger portion of the market.
Fearing the erosion of their competitive advantage, the United States and the European Union oppose Israel's revised patent laws and are considering taking the matter to the under the TRIPS Agreement.
Furthermore, the European Union and the United States do not allow imports of generics while the patented drug is still protected and have threatened sanctions against Israel over Israel's interpretation of the TRIPS Agreement.
This objection, however, will not prevent other nations from purchasing Israeli exports.
Canadian exporters are advised to follow this issue closely and take all necessary precautions to protect intellectual property.
Trademarks Applications for trademark protection may be made by the owner or their agent with written authorization from the owner.
All applicants must present a local address and pay the required fee of approximately $200.
The term of trademark protection is seven years but is renewable indefinitely for periods of 14 years upon payment of required fees.
Priority of registration is given to the first local user of the trademark and every application must specify goods or services falling within one class only.
Under the terms of the Paris Convention, where an application to register a trade or service mark in another signatory country has been made, the applicant has a right to claim priority for registration of the same trademark in Israel for the same use.
Local Standards, Certificates or Registrations Standard documentation includes a certificate of origin, a commercial invoice and a bill of lading.
All imports into Israel must have a label indicating the content, weight and volume of the shipment, the country of origin, the name and address of the producer and the Israeli importer.
In all instances Hebrew must be used.
English may be added provided it appears no larger than the Hebrew print.
In addition, specific labelling regulations may apply to various types of pharmaceuticals.
Exporters are advised to consult with Israeli authorities or their local agent/importer to obtain specific requirements.
Export Credit Risks, Restrictions on Letters of Credit, Currency Controls Despite the security situation and political upheavals, conditions for financing in Israel remain favourable.
Payment is usually done through a letter of credit.
Credit terms last 60-90 days.
In cases where distribution arrangements are concluded, exporters are advised to prepare a contract detailing all major points of agreement, rights and responsibilities.
Local currency delays are, on average, one month.
Although local currency payments are generally made by importers within two weeks, foreign exchange delays of two months are reported.
The current import cover is 5.8 months.

Market Information Middle East and North Africa Agri-Food Sector Profile(1) - Lebanon July 2003
Canadian Embassy in Beirut 43 Jal el Dib Highway Beirut, Lebanon Contact:
MARKET OVERVIEW Lebanon's agriculture sector accounts for 13% of gross domestic product (GDP) and employs an estimated 13% of the country's labour force.
About 70% of Lebanon's food needs are satisfied by imports and the diversity of imported food items is quite remarkable.
Although Lebanon's agriculture sector has the potential to be one of the most productive in the region, it is underdeveloped and poorly managed.
Only 55% of the productive areas are exploited, often in an inefficient and wasteful manner.
Major crops include vegetables, (tomatoes, potatoes), fruits (citrus fruit, bananas, grapes, apples), olives, tobacco, cereals (mainly wheat).
The major agriculture industries are wine (expected to grow at between 5% and 10% a year), olive oil and table olives, and dairy milk production.
The agriculture sector suffers from lack of funding, receiving just 0.33% of the state budget in 2002.
Private-sector finance, is equally limited, with bank loans to agriculture accounting for only 2% of bank credits.
The government has also introduced Export Plus, a subsidy program aimed at assisting agriculture exporters with their crops (vegetables, fruit, flowers and eggs).
Agri-food transformation/food processing (mainly for fruit and vegetables), once considered to be a major part of Lebanon's agriculture and agri-food industry, is almost non-existent and requires substantial rebuilding.
The local distribution market suffers from the absence of government quality control, a lack of marketing regulations, and competition from lower-priced products from border and neighbouring countries.
For the size of the Lebanese economy, the quantity and diversity of food imports are impressive.
In this small country, food imports range from basic food categories to the finest foods, wines and spirits.
Total food imports are estimated at almost $2 million(2) (US $1.3 million) for 2002.
Major Canadian agri-food products exported to Lebanon that same year were lentils, chickpeas, sunflower, canary seeds, beans and cheese.
OPPORTUNITIES Opportunities for Canadian exporters to Lebanon include pulses, seed potatoes, meat, canola oil, finished products, canned/frozen food, dairy products (especially cheese), confectionery, and health and organic food.
With regard to the seed potatoes market, regulations including sanitary barriers, gross imported quantity and varieties to be imported are subject to yearly changes.
Generally, focus should be on price and nutritional properties, as the Lebanese consumer is quite health-oriented and reads labels carefully.
Further opportunities are opening up in the tourism/hospitality/catering sector, which shows consistent growth.
The hotel and restaurant sector is a dynamic market in Lebanon, and will be boosted by substantial growth for the next few years.
The ethnic restaurant (Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese Thaii) sector is also growing.

KEY PARTICIPANTS Canadian agri-food products face strong competition from Europe (especially companies from Italy, France, Germany and the Netherlands) due to Lebanon's long-standing ties with European countries, the strong representation of European companies in the Lebanese market and the relatively cheaper shipping costs for goods coming from Europe.
The United States has a considerable share, almost 48%, of the market and has managed to overcome the obstacles of long-distance transportation and decreasing the cost of shipment by exporting from Europe.
PRIVATE- AND PUBLIC-SECTOR CUSTOMERS Lebanon is committed to reducing tariffs in line with its efforts to sign local, regional and global trade pacts.
Another measure adopted in 2001, was the reduction of tariff rates on imported goods in order to boost the economy and to comply with the process of Lebanon's accession to the World Trade Organization's conditions.
Tariffs on raw materials not available in Lebanon and semi-finished products not made in Lebanon have been abolished.
Tariffs vary between 50% and 70% on luxury items and up to 5% on items deemed necessary.
Imported food products requiring special licences include apples, olives, citrus fruit, pears, almonds, potato seeds and agricultural fertilizers.
Labelling on imported items should include net weight, production/expiry dates, ingredients and origin.
Labels in Arabic are not highly regarded as the Lebanese consider European and North American labels--in French or English--to be a guarantee of higher quality.
Substantial delays and administrative constraints in clearing imported products at customs/ports of entry are to be expected and quite frequent.
In order to decrease shipping costs, Canadian companies are advised to ship to the Middle East via Europe by either manufacturing their products in Europe or by re-exporting them.
It is preferable to have a local agent, representative or partner.
A small number of companies constitute the major food importers in the country and have their own distribution network.

Morocco Past Present & Future Report November 2005 Overview The Kingdom of Morocco is located in the northwest corner of Africa, and at its closest point, it is less than 15 kilometers away from Spain.
With a population of 31.1 million people, Morocco is a middle-income, moderate Arab and Muslim country, which is considered a developing country by international standards.
Morocco has an open economy and is steadily progressing towards greater levels of modernization and globalization.
Morocco is also currently striving to diversify its economy in order to lessen its reliance on the unstable agricultural sector.
Demand for more North American consumer-oriented products is expected to rise due to Morocco’s large and growing tourism industry as well as emerging large supermarkets and Americanized fast-food restaurants.
Currently, the vast majority of Canadian agri-foods entering Morocco are grains, bulks or cereals, especially wheat.
However, this market does present an opportunity for Canadian exports to diversify.
Canada – Morocco Relations Canada and Morocco’s friendly, diplomatic relationship which dates back to 1962 continues to grow.
This is due to many bilateral visits between countries, Canadian financial aid given to Morocco as well as the large Moroccan population living and attending university in Canada.
Currently, Moroccans make up our nation’s largest North African community.
Bilateral trade between Canada and Morocco has gradually increased over the past decade, although the countries’ exchanges remain rather modest and undiversified.
In attempt to become a more active trading partner, Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada organized trade initiatives, which began in 1997 and included trade missions in various sectors such as environment, health and education.
In 2000, Canada led a multi-sector trade mission to the Maghreb which included visits to Morocco and Southern Europe.
This was the largest ever Canadian trade mission to North Africa.
Canada and Morocco relations have also flourished due to Canadian social development programs for Moroccans which have been ongoing since 1963.
For a more comprehensive overview of Canadian-Moroccan relations and trade arrangements please visit: dfait-maeci.gc.ca/middle_east/morocco_relations-en.asp
Top Canadian exports to Morocco are wheat and newsprint.
Top imports from Morocco are mandarins and petroleum oil preparations (including gasoline).
• Total Canada/Morocco agriculture trade was valued at $172.1 million in 2004.
Agriculture trade represents roughly 68% of all trade between the two countries.
In 2004, Canadian agri-food exports to Morocco totalled $121.1 million, increasing nearly 12% from 2003’s total of $108.1 million.
Top Canadian exports to Morocco in 2004 were durum wheat valued at nearly $102.2 million and accounting for 84.4% of agri-food exports, and wheat accounted for $11.2 million or 9.2% of total exports.
In 2004, bulk exports accounted for almost all of Canada’s agri-food exports to Morocco, with a value of $115.1 million.
In the same year, intermediate exports totalled only $5 million and consumer-oriented exports totalled less than $500,000.
Since food processing is Morocco’s primary processing industry, bulk food exports are expected to continually dominate Canadian agri-food exports to the country in the future.
Lentils and varieties of peas (split, green and yellow) are making strong headway into the Moroccan marketplace in the first half of 2005, respectively accounting for 10.5% and 2.6% of 2005’s export totals through October 2005.
Economy Morocco faces many challenges of a typical developing country; restraining government spending, reducing constraints on private activity and foreign trade, reducing high unemployment rates and achieving sustainable growth.
To improve conditions, the Moroccan government is currently working to liberalize its economy and foreign trade while keeping focused on its long-term challenges of improving education, living standards and job prospects for Morocco’s youth.
This has encouraged its government to work towards economic diversification, particularly towards manufacturing and services, which presently account for 35.8% and 43%, respectively, of Morocco’s GDP.
Morocco has a strong mineral sector, which is dominated by its phosphate reserves.
When attempting to export to Morocco it is important for exporters to focus mainly on its urban cities.
• The Moroccan government’s goal is to attract 10 million tourists to its country by 2010.
• The tourism industry is an important sector for Canadian exporters to consider as the growth of the industry is expected to boost demand for packaged food.
In the future, Canadian exporters should consider exporting high quality fish and seafood and dairy ingredients for the country’s expanding ice cream market.
• There are about 40 upscale hotels (5 star), 25 tourist villages and clubs, and over 139 hotels with 4-star rankings in Morocco.
These accommodations are concentrated mostly in Agadir, Marrakech, Casablanca, Rabat, and Fes.
Morocco is a partner country of the European Trade Agreement.
Competing in this market can be made easier by making a contact in the country.
Exporters are encouraged to establish a linkage to Moroccan importers.
These importers are usually located in Casablanca and are described as being very progressive and marketing-oriented.
Exporters interested in selling consumer-ready goods can benefit from choosing a local importer with access to hotels and restaurants, as well as wholesale and retail markets.
Access Issues In an effort to ease the challenges of breaking into a new foreign market, Canadian exporters are encouraged to establish a contact base with local Moroccan importers.
Likewise, exporters should consult the Canadian Embassy in Morocco as a resource for exporting to this country.
The embassy works closely with the Moroccan government to facilitate trade transactions between countries http://www.dfaitmaeci.gc.ca/morocco/.
Morocco Country Report:
•
Import duties in Morocco are generally high and considered the main obstacle faced when exporting to this country.
This has a resulted in significantly reduced waiting times and a now well-organized customs service.
Business Travel Tips
• Moroccan business customs reflect a mix of Arab and Mediterranean influences, rather than African.
Breakfast meetings are rare, lunches tend to be late and long, and business meetings are most commonly held in offices rather than over meals.
Canadian exporters are encouraged to reconfirm appointments in advance and expect encountering delays.
It is also wise to schedule meetings recognizing that some could start, or run late.
Canadian exporters should be aware that Moroccan importers may not be familiar with products, as well as Canadian grades, standards and terminology.
Therefore pictures, brochures and samples may be helpful in business meetings.
Accept mint tea if it is offered as this is a symbol for hospitality in Morocco.
It is common for businesses to close for lunch from noon to 2:00 p.m., except during the period from June 15 to September 15 and during the month of Ramadan.
During Ramadan, many businesses remain open at mid-day but close earlier in the afternoon.
Morocco is a Muslim country.
Consumption of alcohol during the fasting month of Ramadan is prohibited for Muslims only.
Canadian exporters should exercise a high degree of caution in Morocco as Western interests, in particular, are at risk in this region.
Commercial and public areas known to be frequented by foreigners such as hotels, clubs, restaurants, bars, schools, places of worship, outdoor recreation events and tourist areas are more susceptible to risk.
Agriculture Sector & Policies Morocco is extremely dependant on its agricultural sector as it accounts for 15-20% of Morocco’s GDP (depending on the harvest) and employs about 40% of the country’s workforce.
Over 90% the country’s agriculture is rain-fed and thus this output is very unreliable.
Although this is a very important sector in Morocco, only 19% of the country’s land is cultivated.
Agriculture products include barley, wheat, citrus, wine, vegetables and livestock.
Morocco is a net exporter of fish as well as fruits and vegetables and imports many cereals, oilseeds and sugar.
Morocco has a rich fisheries sector which employs about 400,000 people (directly and indirectly).
The chief fishing centres in Morocco are Agadir, Safi, Essaouira, and Casablanca and the fish catch includes sardines, tuna, mackerel, anchovies, and shellfish.
Much of Morocco’s fish is processed—frozen or canned—for export to Europe, predominately.
Morocco’s food processing industry is one of its primary industries due its integration of the country’s rich and highly diversified local natural resources.

Tunisia Past Present & Future Report December 2005 Overview Tunisia is a predominantly Arab Muslim country which is located in Northern Africa and borders the Mediterranean Sea.
Despite its small geographic size, Tunisia leads Northern Africa in its economic diversity and has one of the highest standards of living on the continent.
Since 1987, the Tunisian government has greatly improved its economy and is now focused on moving towards greater international competitiveness.
Tunisia is a country with few natural resources, and is therefore highly reliant on foreign trade.
Currently, its imports and exports make up 80% of the country’s GDP.
Tunisia is a strong market prospect for Canadian exporters looking to tap into the North African food market; this is mainly due to the country’s growing middle-class, modernized food retail sector and thriving tourism sector.
Canada – Tunisia Relations Canada and Tunisia have a friendly bilateral relationship.
Tunisia is one of Canada’s longest-standing partners in Africa, with the earliest diplomatic Canadian-Tunisian contact dating back to 1957.
In 1966, Canada’s first embassy in the North African region of Maghreb opened in Tunisia’s capital, Tunis.
Canada-Tunisia relations are also strengthened due to Tunisia’s large Africanfrancophone base.
Tunisia is a founding member of La Francophonie and uses French as a delivery channel for its foreign policy.
Tunisia has long been a beneficiary of Canadian cooperation and aid in Africa.
Established in 1964, Canada’s cooperation program with Tunisia was one of the first in a Francophone African country.
Canada’s current development projects in Tunisia are CIDA’s Private Sector Development Fund and the Institutional Strengthening Program.
Currently, trade with Tunisia remains undeveloped although it has become increasingly diversified over the years.
The value of Canadian exports fluctuates considerably from year to year.

Tunisia Country Report:
Canada-Tunisia Bilateral Trade 2004 Tunisia Total Trade Exports (f.o.b) Imports (f.o.b) Trade balance Canada-Tunisia Trade Exports Imports Trade balance Canada-Tunisia Ag Trade Exports Imports Trade balance US$20.8 billion US $9.3 billion US $11.5 billion (US$2.2 billion) $56.3 million $32.4 million $23.9 million $8.5 million $16.5 million $10.4 million $6.1 million $4.3 million
In 2004, Canada’s top exports to Tunisia were wheat and electrical safety and traffic control equipment.
Main imports from Tunisia were olive oil and clothing.
Agricultural Trade Tunisia’s agricultural trade fluctuates annually due to its rain-fed products’ reliance on an unstable climate.
In drought years, the country relies heavily on imported agricultural commodities; while years showing favourable rainfall for domestic crops results in a decline in imported agricultural products.
In 2004, Canadian exporters saw a severe drop in agri-food exports to Tunisia, as the country witnessed favorable weather conditions and crop production.
Canadian agri-food exports to Tunisia totalled $16.5 million, decreasing by roughly 86% from 2003’s total of $74.7 million.
In contrast, Tunisia experienced a drought year in 2002 and Canadian agri-food exports reached $118.7 million.
Although agricultural trade with Tunisia rises and falls, agri-food exporters may benefit from Canada’s growing presence in the Tunisian food market.
Companies such as Rougement, Quebec’s Lassonde International Inc., Prevost Quebec’s Au Printemps Gourmet, Florenceville, McCain Produce and the Canadian Wheat Board are recently having success in the Tunisian food market.
Canada’s Top 4 Agricultural Exports to Tunisia (2004) Durum wheat Live turkeys Lentils Canary seed $9.9 million $337,000 $92,000 $42,000
Economy In 1987, the Tunisian government launched a privatisation and restructuring program to improve the country’s economy.
Over the years, this reform has built a more solid, diversified and competitive economy which is continually working to adapt to a new international environment.
Although the Tunisian government is still quite involved in the economy, its control over international affairs has lessoned with a turn towards privatization, simplification of the tax structure and a cautious approach to debt.
The government’s progressive social policies have also helped to raise the country’s living conditions.
Agriculture, textiles and clothing, mining, energy and tourism sectors are important contributors to the Tunisian economy.
In recent years, favorable rainfall, increased tourism rates and the removal of trade barriers with the European Union (EU) are all factors improving Tunisia’s economy.
In future years, Tunisia is looking towards broader privatization, increased foreign investment, improvements in government efficiency and reduction of the trade deficit.
• In 2004, Tunisia’s inflation increased to 3.6%.
From 1999-2003, the rate of inflation was steady, averaging 2.7% inflation during the period.
• In 2004, Tunisia had the highest per capita income in Northern Africa and ranked 6th on the African continent.
Forecast:
Agriculture Sector & Policies Agriculture is one of the most important sectors to Tunisia’s economy, accounting for roughly 13.7% of its GDP and one-fifth of its workforce.
The geography and climate of Tunisia is varied, containing a temperate mountainous region in the north, a Mediterranean maritime climate along the east coast, hot and dry plains in the centre and desert conditions in the south.
Of this land mass, roughly 18% is arable.
Tunisian agriculture, while important to the economy, lacks modern infrastructure and features an unpredictable climate which has negatively affected the country’s ability to be self-sufficient.
Tunisia also has few natural resources, which has increasingly put a large constraint on its agricultural sector.
Soil erosion, desertification, and rapid urbanization have depleted agriculture of arable land, labour and water and reduced its capacity for satisfying the growing food demand of the Tunisian population.
In an effort to combat these problems, the Tunisian government has implemented policies designed to conserve and better manage their resources.
This agreement especially increased the export of olive oil, double concentrate tomato paste and table grapes.
Next to olive oil, the fish and seafood industry represents the second major source of food export and is a principal activity in the agricultural sector.
This industry contributes roughly 8% of the agriculture value added.
Tunisia’s common fish catch includes tuna fish, shrimp, cuttlefish and squid, shellfish and mussels, octopus, sea bass and sea bream, sardines as well as anchovies.
Tunisia also has a food processing sector that is important to its economy.
Despite its underdeveloped status as compared to North American and European standards, food processing is Tunisia’s second largest industry next to its textile and clothing industry, accounting for 17% of industry activity.
There is also opportunity for Canadians to export to Tunisia’s expanding modernized retail food industry.
These retail outlets offer more variety for Tunisian consumers, including an array of imported food products.
Tunisia’s tourism industry also offers opportunity to Canadians wishing to tap into the country’s food market.
Every year 5 million tourists visit Tunisia and this industry is expanding, with 8,000 new beds being added to hotels each year.
Demand for imported food products is likely to grow, especially in less established tourism markets in the northwest coast and in the southern interior.
• Tunisians are moving towards more sophisticated consumption patterns due to the increase in modern food retailing.
• Tunisian consumers devote roughly US$5 billion, or 38%, of overall household spending, on food every year.
Common purchases include bread, pasta, semolina, olive oil and dairy products.
• Consumers are increasingly spending more on groceries.
• It is estimated that consumers living in Tunisia’s urban households spend nearly 65% more on food than consumers living in rural households.
Factors contributing to this are an increase of dual income households, increased urbanization and increased exposure to western lifestyles and products.
• About 80% of Tunisian families own houses and poverty numbers have been greatly decreased.
In 2004, Tunisia’s poverty rate was 7.6%, which is relatively low in comparison to Canada’s poverty rate.
• Tunisia has a young population with over 55% of Tunisians under the age of 25.
• 98% of the population is Muslim, and the official religion is Sunni Islam.
• Currently, there are roughly 220 modern food retail outlets: 2 hypermarkets, 120 supermarkets and 100 superettes (self-service food outlets with a selling area less than 500 sq. meters).
• Major players in the Tunisian modern food retailing industry are:
• Tourists represent an important consumer group to Canadian exporters, as 5 million visitors come to the country each year.
In recent years, these numbers have dropped due to political instability in the region and fallout from US terrorist attacks in 2001; however, tourism numbers are expected to recover.
• In 2005, tourism revenues were expected to surpass 2001’s record earning of $2.5 billion.
• To meet demands of international visitors, the Tunisian tourism industry requires a moderate amount of imported food.
Consequently, the sector represents opportunities for foreign suppliers of food and related services.
• Generally, the tourist industry is driven by visitors from four European countries:
Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom.
These four nations contribute more than 75% of Tunisia’s tourist income.
Other visitors to Tunisia are from neighboring North African countries.
• In current terms, there are roughly 240 restaurants in Tunisia, catering to both domestic and international tourists.
• Over half of all restaurants in Tunisia are considered high-quality.
These types of restaurants are most likely to purchase foreign foods and should therefore be the primary target of Canadian companies selling to the restaurant industry.
• High-end hotels import spirits, wines and specialty cheeses either directly or via import companies.
In particular, hotels and restaurants are excellent targets for alcoholic beverage producers.
• Most hotels and restaurants in Tunisia source their food needs either through annual tenders or using the same distribution channels as households.
Competitors Canadian exporters face tough competition from European countries.
The EU is Tunisia’s major market: approximately 75-80% of Tunisia’s exports go to the EU, and more than 60% of imports originate from France, Italy, Germany and Spain.
France, especially, is a key export partner to Tunisia, as the countries have a strong history of francophone ties.
In addition to gaining closer bilateral trade relationships with Europe, Tunisia has pursued stronger relations with its North African neighbors.
In 2001, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia joined forces in The Great Arab Free Trade Zone ahead of the 2010 target for trade barriers to end in the Euro-Mediterranean area.
Over time, this free trade zone is expected to encompass 10 Arab nations.
The United States also has trade relationship with Tunisia through the United States-North African Economic Partnership, which encourages increased two-way trade between USA, Tunisia and other Maghreb states.
Although Canadian exporters face much competition from these countries, especially Europe, those Canadians wishing to transport food products to Tunisia can benefit from improved infrastructure which was put in place to obtain a free-trade status with the EU.
Tunisia has made changes to its Tunis-Carthage International Airport, and road and rail network improvements are increasing steadily.
Berthing space and port facilities are undergoing continuous upgrading.
Access Issues Canadian exporters must be prepared for bureaucratic hurdles when entering the Tunisian market due to the country’s traditionally high tariffs that protect the country’s domestic industries (particularly on consumer-oriented products).
Exporters of bulk and intermediate goods may also face "red tape".
In recent years, however, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has urged that high-tariffs be reduced as part of Tunisia’s "second-generation reforms".
The best way to access the Tunisian food retail market is through suitable local importers who are experienced in working with modern retail outlets.
Such importers are able to negotiate shelf space and promotional activities with supermarket chains.
Canadian exporters are encouraged to check the credentials of Tunisian importers.
Another approach may be to contact retailers directly, especially if exporters are interested in making large quantity shipments.
Small grocery stores Tunisia Country Report:
source their goods mostly from wholesalers and from certain importers who have their own distribution fleet to supply goods at the retail level.
Tunisia’s business environment is generally credible.
Long pants should always be worn by men, while women are advised to wear clothing that covers the majority of the body, especially shoulders and legs.
Establishing a personal relationship with prospective business partners is essential in doing business in Tunisia.
Maintaining this relationship through regular visits and other forms of personal contact are also recommended.
Because of the country’s emphasis on personal relationships, cold calling or sending direct mail to potential clients or customers is not recommended.
Tunisians perceive Canadian goods as of high-quality, but businessmen may be reluctant to pay substantial premiums, as price remains the most determining factor.
Therefore, Canadian exporters should be prepared for relatively demanding price negotiations.
Tunisia’s official language is Arabic, although French is widely spoken and serves as the common business language.
Many Tunisians are also beginning to speak English.
When invited into a Tunisian home for an Iftar meal, the meal marking the end of fast at sunset, it is common for guests to bring a small gift as a token of appreciation.
Businesses and offices in Tunis, the country’s capital, operate very limited hours during the month of August.

Table of Contents 1.
The world Halal food trade is estimated to reach US$150 billion annually.
Canada remains a small supplier of Halal products.
With approximately nine million Muslims, North America is the primary market for Canadian Halal products.
However, the increased demand for Halal products in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and North Africa represents an opportunity for Canadian companies to capture new markets, particularly in countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Malaysia and Indonesia.
Various statistical sources were consulted.
For Halal meat market information outside North America, country overviews and the contribution of agriculture to the economy are derived from the CIA World Fact Book.
The value of meat imported, along with Canada’s position against the top five suppliers for each country comes from Global Trade Atlas.
Specific import regulations on Halal meat are synthesized from country specific reports published from AAFC, International Trade Canada, and the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service.
The concept of Halal 2.1 Introduction This report provides information destined to assist Canadian agri-food companies compete with top Halal meat exporters and increase Canada's market share of the growing Halal food market.
The concept of Halal is described as well as the certification process.
The report also analyzes North American demand and market opportunities as well as general requirements by countries in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and North Africa.
A special focus is made on the market opportunities and official requirements for trade of Halal meat with the following countries:
Algeria Brunei Egypt Indonesia Iran Kuwait Malaysia Morocco Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates (UAE)
The opposite of Halal is Haram, which means unlawful.
The practice of Islam includes observing dietary laws that define foods that are Halal.
For Muslim consumers, meat products must be verified as Halal and must originate from certified slaughterhouses.
Many food products are clearly Halal or clearly Haram.
Others may be referred to as Mashbooh, which means doubtful.
Foods containing ingredients such as gelatine, enzymes, and emulsifiers are questionable (Mashbooh) because the origin of these ingredients is not known (IFANCA).
Market Opportunities in North America Islam is the second largest religion in the world and is also the fastest growing (www.eat-Halal.com/certification.shtml). As of 2003, there were approximately 1.4 billion Muslims in the world.
By the year 2025, 30% of the world’s population is expected to be Muslim (CIA World Fact Book, 2000).
North America has a Muslim population of approximately 9 million (IFANCA).
It is important for Canadian companies to understand the culture, tastes and preferences of Muslim consumers.
Consumers are expecting high-quality Halal food products at competitive prices.
3.1 Canada The Canadian domestic Halal meat market is estimated to be valued at $214 million.
The average annual household expenditure on Halal meat is $1,623.
The 2001 Canadian census outlined that there were approximately 579,640 Muslims in Canada, constituting 2% of Canada’s population.
The Canadian Muslim population is expected to double by the end of this decade (Statistics Canada).
Table 1 provides information on Canada’s Muslim population by province and territory, according to the latest Statistics Canada data in 2001.

The exact figure is difficult to ascertain because the United States census does not include questions regarding religious affiliation.
Certification process 4.1 Canadian Food Inspection Agency The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) aims to safeguard Canada’s food supply to ensure high-quality and safe standards.
4.2 General CFIA regulations for exports All foods produced in Canada for export must be inspected by the CFIA prior to export.
Only meat products prepared in CFIA registered establishments may be exported.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency provides a current listing of federally registered meat establishments.
Meat Inspection Regulations, 1990 Section on Meat Products for Exports 121.
No operator shall identify as edible any meat product intended for export unless the meat product meets the requirements of the importing country and is packaged and labelled in accordance with section 122.
(1) Subject to subsection (2), every operator shall package and label a meat product intended for export in accordance with the requirements of the importing country or, where no such requirements exist, shall package and label the meat product as required by Part III.
(2) Every operator shall ensure that a meat product that is produced for export as an edible meat product and does not meet the requirements of these Regulations for a meat product intended for sale, use or consumption as an edible meat product in Canada is, in addition to being packaged and labelled in accordance with all other requirements of these Regulations, labelled as being for export.
All export shipments of meat products (except those specifically exempted in the Meat Inspection Regulations) must be accompanied by a "Certificate of Inspection Covering Meat Products" authorized by CFIA.
In addition, only an official veterinarian may sign certificates for exports of meat products.
Standard trade documentation, including bills of lading and attestations by the government and/or embassy of the importing country must be present.
The CFIA is not involved in Halal certification.
Canadian companies interested in obtaining Halal certification should contact one of the certification bodies listed in Appendix 2 for specific regulations.
Submit an application form for Halal certification and supervision.
An inspector must inspect the facility to verify that it complies with Halal standards, including process, products, materials, and sanitation procedures.
Once the inspection report is complete, it is submitted to the Halal Slaughter Certification Committee (SCC) along with any recommendations.
Registration of slaughter facility
Upon approval of the plant by the SCC, the registrant will receive an official letter, specifying the terms and conditions of the registration.
A supervisor will be assigned to perform the necessary procedures in the plant.
A supervision fee is usually dependent upon the work entailed.
Certification fee
The certification fee is established after the plant is registered and accounts for details such as the number of plants involved, the complexity of the product line, the product volume and the projected consultation requirements throughout the year.
Issuance of certificates and signing of agreement
Every certifying body has a registered symbol for labels of Halal products.
Certificates are issued for each batch of Halal products.
Market Opportunities outside North America and Specific Requirements by Country In this section, an overview of the country is given while the domestic agricultural production is highlighted.
Canada’s presence is quite small in the other countries.
Many countries have special requirements, which are either in addition to, or distinct from, Canadian requirements.
Individual countries outline regulations specific to their needs.
However, there are common requirements across markets worth noting:
Halal exportcertified establishments must also ensure their meat products originate from a source approved by the importing country.
The Islamic organization providing the certification must be approved by the importing country.
The presence of pork and/or alcohol must be strictly and clearly labelled in some countries.
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which stipulates that all products must arrive with at least half of their shelf life remaining.
General documents: commercial invoice, bill of lading, certificate of origin, Halal certificate, and veterinary health certificate for meat products are examples of common documents required in each country.
5.1 Algeria (Capital city:
Algiers) Algeria is situated in Northern Africa and borders Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Niger, Mali, Mauritania, Western Sahara and the coast of the Mediterranean sea and has a population of nearly 33 million.

According to Euromonitor, meat accounts for nearly 20% of consumer expenditure on food in Algeria.
The majority, in fact, 92% of meat imported by Algeria is bovine meat.
Mutton and goat meat holds the next highest share of all meat imported at 6%.
Brazil provided nearly half of this volume, followed by Argentina, New Zealand, and Australia.
Algeria did not import meat from Canada in 2005, but it did import $US 42,458 worth of bovine meat in 2004 from Canada (GTI).
There must be an agreement on the authorization of imports between the food inspection agency of the exporting country and the Direction of Veterinary Health of the Ministry of Agriculture in Algeria prior to imports.
In recent years, Algeria has experienced market liberalization and reductions in customs duties.
French is the predominant business language, giving an advantage to importers capable in French.
Most importers are in large cities and import through main active ports.
Export certificate for breeding cattle has been agreed upon with Canada.
Halal certification is required for meat products entering Algeria.
Customs clearance requires four to five days.
The importer has 21 days to clear merchandise through customs, after which it is transferred to storage.
Goods with a durable life within one year must have a durable life of at least half of their shelf life on the inspection date.
Products with a durable life of more than one year must have a durable life of at least 30% of their shelf life on the date of inspection.
Proper labelling requires Arabic, the product’s common name, all ingredients, the specific quantity, contact information, and manufacture and expiry dates.
The customs tariff comprises three rates: 5%, 15% and 30%.
Some specific items are subject to a VAT ranging between 7 and 17%.
A domestic consumption tax (TIC) also applies to meat products.
Brunei (Capital city:
Bandar Seri Begawan) Brunei is a small country that lies on the northwest coast of Borneo.
Per capita income is high for the population of roughly 380,000.
Malay is the official language while English and Chinese are used as well.
The Islamic faith is the official religion of Brunei and 67% of people are Muslim.
Brunei produces poultry, eggs, and water buffalo.
Half of Brunei’s meat imports in 2003 was bovine meat.
Importers of meat must apply for a Halal Import Permit from the Controller of Customs under the Board for issuing Halal Import Permits.
Whenever any Halal meat is imported, authorized officers from the Ministry of Health and the Agriculture Department will examine it and certify it as fit for human consumption.
The Inspection Committee shall ensure that meat must only be imported from countries where animals are free from dangerous and contagious diseases and where only local animals are slaughtered.
The inclusion of alcohol in food products must be labelled in capital bold-faced lettering of non-serif character greater than six points.
Cairo) Egypt occupies the northeast corner of Africa, bordering Libya in the west, Sudan in the south, the Mediterranean Sea in the north, and the Red Sea and Israel in the east.
The majority of the population of nearly 79 million is concentrated near the fertile Nile valley.
Approximately 90% of the population is Muslim.
Cattle, water buffalo, sheep and goats are among Egypt’s agricultural products.
Over 32% of the labour force is involved in agriculture, which comprises 16% of the overall GDP.
For consumers in Egypt, around 23% of food spending is on meat.
According to 2003 figures, consumption of red meat, poultry, and fish reached 4.6, 7.4, and 18.6 kilograms per capita, respectively (Euromonitor).
In 2004, Egypt imported $US 183,273,907 worth in meat.

These zones are subject to minimal regulation.
Individual agents must be of Egyptian nationality and residents of Egypt for at least five years.
Canadian Access (as of March 5, 2006):
Currently bovine meat products are limited to chilled or frozen boneless beef, including beef livers, kidneys and hearts.
Poultry imports are not permitted.
This certificate must accompany products labelled Halal.
The Egyptian Embassy in Canada must authenticate the certificate.
Halal labelling is a responsibility of the exporter.
General labelling must be in Arabic and English and include storage temperatures on all meat products, production and expiration dates, and metric net weight.
All products must be shipped direct from the country of origin.
Jakarta) Indonesia is the world's largest archipelagic state, comprising 17,508 islands and stretching between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.
Indonesia is home to the world’s largest Muslim population.
Given that 88% of the total population of 245 million people belong to the Islamic faith, Indonesia offers positive opportunities for Halal food exports.
According to Euromonitor, Indonesians allocate 8.4% of their consumer food expenditure to meat.
In Indonesia, the number of chicken farms is greater than the number of red meat farms.
Between 1998 and 2003, poultry consumption soared by 34% from 3.04 to 4.07 kg per capita.
Overall, prices of red meat fluctuate significantly depending on demand, supply, imports, and holidays.
Processed foods are popular, especially frozen items.
Indonesians typically stockpile frozen poultry and meat before major holidays and anticipated price jumps.
A secondary reason for growing acceptance of frozen foods is that refrigerators have become more affordable to many people.
Nearly 47% of the country’s labour force is employed in agriculture, a sector that is responsible for 15% of the country’s total GDP.
In 2003, three quarters of Indonesia’s meat imports were bovine meat.
The next leading type of meat imported was pig meat, which stood for 17% of all imports.
Poultry and mutton and goat meat split the remainder (FAO).
Singapore and China were also notable import partners.
For imported products, the registration process is completed by the Indonesian importers before goods are shipped to Indonesia.
Current Import Regulations:
Customs clearance can be finished in two days given complete documentation.
However, poultry may not always require Halal certification.
Exporters are advised to verify this with their importer before shipping.
Meat imported into Indonesia is legally required to be inspected and certified as Halal.
Labels must use the Indonesian language and Arabic numerals.
Labels include as a minimum the product name, ingredients, net weight in metric units, the importer’s name and address, expiry date, and whether the product is Halal.
Products derived from swine must be labelled by "MENGANDUNG BABI" (contains pork) in red "universe medium corps 12" font.
The writing must be enclosed in a red rectangle with a drawing of a pig.
The State Livestock Affairs Logistics (SLAL) and the Government Trading Corporation (GTC) are the two main importers of meat in Iran, as the private sector is not allowed to import.
A notable feature of Iran’s trade policies is how it is subject to US economic sanctions and export controls.
Approximately 90% of all meat that Iran imports is bovine meat.
Poultry completes the rest of Iran’s meat imports (FAO).
In 2003, Iran imported $US 60,711,964 worth in meat, of which over half originated from Ireland, and 30% came from Brazil.
The exporting establishment has the responsibility to conform to the importing country’s standards.
All imports must be registered with the Ministry of Commerce in order to obtain a general import licence.
5.6 Kuwait (Capital city:

Agri-Food Past, Present & Future Report Saudi Arabia December 2006
This report is intended as a concise overview of the market for those interested in its potential and is not intended to provide in-depth analysis which may be required by the individual exporter.
Although every effort has been made to ensure that the information is correct, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada assumes no responsibility for its accuracy, reliability, or for any decisions arising from the information contained herein.

Saudi Arabia Country Report:
Saudi Arabia Past Present & Future Report December 2006 Overview Saudi Arabia is the world’s largest oil exporter, with by far the greatest proven reserves of crude oil.
Based on current output, there are sufficient reserves for almost 90 years of extraction.
This oil wealth has transformed the country’s economy, although politically and socially Saudi Arabia remains highly conservative.
Canada-Saudi Arabia Relations Canadian - Saudi relations are built on a strong bilateral trade relationship, with trade increasing significantly since 2002.
While imports from Saudi Arabia dominate trade, Canada’s exports have seen very positive increases.
Exports reached a high in 2004, fell slightly in 2005, but maintained a level well above pre-2002 totals.
Canada’s imports are dominated by oil, with most trade value increases with Saudi Arabia a result of recent record oil prices.
• The value of Canada's two-way trade with Saudi Arabia was approximately $1.7 billion in 2005.
Canadian exports to the Kingdom in 2005 totalled $439 million a significant decrease of almost $150 million from 2004.
Despite the decrease, Saudi Arabia continues to be one of Canada's largest merchandise export markets in the Middle East and North Africa.
Canada’s largest export to Saudi Arabia in 2005 was barley followed by paper products, vehicles and lumber.
Canada's merchandise imports from Saudi Arabia in 2005 were valued at $1.7 billion and consisted mainly of crude oil, organic chemicals, and refined petroleum products.
Canada-Saudi Arabia Bilateral Trade Saudi Arabia Total Trade Exports Imports Trade balance $165 billion $45 billion $120 billion
Canada-Saudi Arabia Trade $439 million Exports Imports Trade balance $1.7 billion ($1.2 billion)
Canada-Saudi Arabia Ag Trade $77.66 million Exports Imports Trade balance $76.61 million
suppliers are increasingly important players in the Saudi market.
There has been success, particularly in dairy production, but the country is currently nowhere near self sufficient agricultural production.
Saudi Arabia's agri-food imports in 2004 were estimated to be $8 billion, up from $6.3 billion in 2003.
Barley alone represents 10% of total agricultural imports.
Canada is forecast to export 500,000 tonnes to Saudi Arabia.
The country’s top suppliers of agricultural products include; Ukraine, Syria, Brazil, India and the United States.
Overview of Agricultural Trade Between Canada and Saudi Arabia
Canada’s exports were valued at $77.6 million or roughly 98% of total Canada-Saudi Arabia agricultural trade in 2005.
Despite decreases in barely exports, 2005 witnessed significant increases in a number of product categories.
For instance, cheese and lentil exports both grew by over $1 million.
Even more impressive was the growth in exports of ground nuts (+$2.2 million) and ice cream (+$6 million).
Canada’s exports are dominated by bulk commodities, namely barley, and comprise 98% of Canada’s total bulk exports.
Exports of consumer products have been increasing steadily since 2003.
Through to September of 2006, exports of consumer goods have already exceeded 2005 totals.
Canada imported $1.05 million worth of agricultural goods from Saudi Arabia in 2005.
Imports from Saudi Arabia have been in a slow decline since 2003, usually falling $100,000 annually.
• Sectors that have been identified as potential targets for privatisation include electric power, mining, aviation, and telecommunications.
Saudi Arabia Country Report:
Non-Saudi nationals and expatriates dominate the Saudi workforce.
This policy has restricted the entry of foreign workers into certain job categories and led to a quota system that requires all companies to employ a percentage of Saudis in their operations.
Forecast While the economic foundation as a major oil exporter looks secure and economic diversification has proven beneficial to the economy, there is little prospect of significant political and economic reform in the near future.
Reforms must be balanced with the political aspirations of senior members of the ruling family and the wishes of the powerful clerical establishment, and it is expected that any future reforms will be cautious and piecemeal.
Plans to introduce an elected component to the national Consultative Council appear to be on hold.
Consumer Market Overview Saudi Arabia is a diverse and highly urbanised society.
While the country remains difficult to access and the food market difficult to penetrate, the country has become increasingly exposed to and influenced by Western trends.
Saudi Arabia is the largest market for high-valued foodstuffs in the Middle East/North African region.
• Saudi Arabia's population is roughly 24 million, of which almost 25% are nonnationals/expatriates.
The Kingdom's population is expected to almost double within 20 years to more than 40 million.
Nearly 70% of the population is under the age of 30, with 40% of the population born after 1990-91.
Riyadh is the capital city and the seat of government.
Other major population centres include Jeddah, on the west coast, and the twin cities of Dammam/AlKhobar on the east coast.
Most expatriates are from South Asia (i.e. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh), Egypt, Sudan, Yemen, the Philippines, and East Africa.
There are roughly 100,000 American and British professionals residing in Saudi Arabia.
Expatriates make up a majority of the Saudi workforce.
In addition to simple staple purchases, supermarket shopping is considered a type of entertainment to Saudi families.
Large play areas for children, boutiques, specialty shops, and fast food restaurants have been incorporated into the grocery buying experience.
There are roughly 300 supermarkets in Saudi Arabia and a significant increase in this number is expected, due to the increasing popularity of Western style shopping formats.
Despite a Western influence to supermarket formats, all supermarket chains in the Kingdom are wholly-owned by Saudi companies.
However, Western (foreign) managers are common.
Until recently, supermarket chains were dependent on local importers for sourcing, merchandising, and inventory control.
However, the benefits of direct importing have not been lost on the larger, high volume chains where this method is increasing in popularity.
Importers are constantly searching for new products, and often request support from suppliers for promotion.
The increasingly positive attitude of Saudis to mass media advertisements means that advertising is considered a necessity to draw Saudi consumers.
Despite the perceived wealth of the population, Saudis can be a price conscious consumer market.
For instance, two-for-one deals have proven to be effective marketing ploys in large supermarkets.
Private labels are becoming commonplace in Saudi Arabia.
It is not uncommon for foreign products to be given Arab sounding names to appeal to local consumers.
Some large Saudi importers are willing to test-market a new food product under the condition that if it succeeds, the product will be labelled under their own private brand.
The limited ability of Saudi women to drive cars has maintained the popularity of local/corner stores (bakalahs).
These stores are present in every neighbourhood and are especially important in the housing compounds of expatriates.
Despite the proliferation of supermarkets, these corner or local stores continue to thrive and have greatly expanded their product base.
Saudi consumers are selective, but enjoy new food products and look for the best deal.
They are attentive to quality, nutritional value, price, and packaging.
International fast food chains continue to expand and are found in major urban areas.
Many of the international fast food chains and select local outlets have chosen to import a significant share of their required ingredients.
A number of international fast food chains and food and beverage companies are actively involved in the Saudi Arabian market.
Competitors Key competitors to products that Canada currently produces are Europe, Australia, New Zealand and the United States.
However, long-term relationships that have developed between Saudi Arabia and companies from these nations have been strained by current geo-political and economic circumstances, leading Saudi businesspeople to begin actively seeking alternatives to traditional suppliers.
This shift could present a number of significant opportunities for Canadian exporters, as Canadian products are perceived as extremely competitive, from both a quality and price standpoint.
Similarly, Saudi Arabia’s agricultural imports are dominated by five key markets (Ukraine, Syria, Brazil, India and the U.S.) and five key products (barley, sheep & goats, frozen chicken, rice and cigarettes).
American products are still a large player in the Saudi food market, but have suffered from a recent boycott.
American products are suffering due to consumer perceptions of political situations, and while they have recovered from the most recent boycott, a growing number of consumers and local buyers are seeking nonAmerican products.
In the search for more non-traditional markets, Saudi Arabia has been very active in improving regional relations in the hopes of strengthening trade relations with its neighbours.
Saudi Arabia is a member of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC), which was established in 1981 to promote prosperity and security among organisation members.
Member states also include the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, and Bahrain.
The GCC has approved duty exemptions covering the import of more than 400 items, including basic foodstuffs.
The Council has also taken a number of steps to promote intra-GCC trade, including the implementation of a Customs Union which has harmonised the customs tariff at 5% of an item's value.
The following is a list of some other consumer ready food products with high export potential:
Additional
• Variety of food ingredients to meet the growing demand of the expanding processing sector.
Access Issues Overview
• Foodstuffs imported freely with very limited non-tariff barriers.
Imports of alcoholic beverages, live swine, pork, and food ingredients or additives which contain pork products (including pork fat and gelatine) are banned.
Meat and poultry shipments must be accompanied by a "Halal" slaughter certificate.
Poultry and livestock meat shipments must show that they are from animals that were not fed animal protein ruminants and were not treated with any growth hormones.
Transhipment of livestock meat through Europe and other countries affected by Bovine Spongiform Encephalopothy (BSE) and Foot and Mouth Disease are banned.
• Getting a visa to visit the country can be difficult.
There are different tax systems for Saudis and non-Saudis.
There is no value-added tax.
Sixteen areas of commercial activity have restrictions on foreign investment.
The willingness of Saudi consumers to support boycotts of Western products is a potential roadblock for exporters during periods of unrest in the Middle East.
Business Travel Tips
• Successful business relationships are very personal, develop over time and maintain a positive air at all times.
Carefully consider offers of hospitality; they are important relationship builders, but reciprocation is expected.
According to customs, social and business contacts are for men only.
Be cognizant of local prayer times.
Businesses will typically close for short periods a number of times a day to allow for prayer.
Visiting during Ramadan is not recommended.
Business will be difficult to conduct and visitors may find it very difficult to adapt their normal behaviour to the strict guidelines of the holy month.
These issues include restrictions on where, when and what to eat and drink during the Holy month.
Western visitors are common and only offensive behaviour or dress will be noticed.
However, the security of Western travelers and expatriates has become an issue recently and necessary precautions should be taken.
The Saudi government has set the task of achieving near self-sufficiency in food, a daunting challenge as Saudi Arabia is one of the world's most arid countries.
Domestic agricultural growth depends on scarce water resources; therefore, recent development plans have sought to diversify products to crops grown with equipment using less water.
The government has made key decisions to limit mass production of products like barley, in order to preserve the country’s limited water resources.
The domestic sector has benefited greatly from neighbouring markets, as Saudi Arabia’s involvement in a regional trade group has given easy access to many of its products.
• Saudi Arabia is home to the largest integrated herd of dairy livestock in the world, and has become self-sufficient in the production of eggs and poultry, cereals, and select fruits and vegetables.
In 2000/01, the Saudi Arabian Agricultural Bank lent US$555 million to the agriculture sector which has greatly benefited in its expansion.
Imports of key inputs for the sector will continue to grow along with sector development (i.e. barley imports).

Market Information Middle East and North Africa TRENDS... food in the UAE 2007
Prepared by Agri-Food Program Section Consulate of Canada Dubai, UAE
Table of Contents INTRODUCTION TRADE/MARKET ACCESS PORK BEEF FISH HALAL PRODUCTS ORGANICS AND OTHER HEALTHFUL MATTERS RETAIL HRI/FOODSERVICE INVESTMENT TREND-BITS...random food for thought!
INTRODUCTION Without a doubt, something in the government's "vision" , as enunciated by the Minister, is clearly working.
For a change, from the countless vision statements we have had to digest over many years, whether corporate or governmental from all parts of the world (including back home), we think the actual visionary piece is, in this case, the driving element of the economic development success equation that is the UAE's.
In 2005, nominal growth was over 26% (real at 8.5%), making this economy the 37th largest globally, and 4th in terms of per capita GDP (e.g., the U.S. is 7th, and Canada 16th).
As I listened to a business show on a Dubai radio station one evening, the commentators seemed a tad apoplectic as a result of that day's business headlines:
"Dubai is second worldwide in building offices" ; and "Dubai airport records world's second best growth" . The reporters queried each other endlessly as to whether such runner-up rankings suggested that Dubai was losing its competitive "edge" . As one might expect when cheering for the home-team, their conclusions would have done any Chambre of Commerce proud...after all Moscow, ranked first in office construction, has roughly ten-times the population base, and at current rates of passenger traffic growth, Dubai airport will overtake the venerable Heathrow by 2011.
We found this little exchange amusing, as one gazes out most any window at a sea of construction cranes hanging over the Dubai landscape.
But what it quickly makes apparent is the seriousness taken here at all levels in having the world's biggest storage facility, richest horse-race purse, tallest building, first Tiger Wood's designed golf course, iconic architecture, or whatever.
In short, no effort is spared in undertaking projects with the objective of a numero uno ranking in the world.
And the bloodline of ever-growing commercial diversification, in its many dimensions and away from petroleum-dependency, is what continues pumping life into the superlatives that frame this economy.
The drive to be first in the world manifests itself in some strange ways.
But again, what would be the point in giving away such "vital" competitive information prematurely to the likes of Singapore, Hong Kong, or even other Gulf states, all with their own designs on entering "the tallest-biggest-first" sweeps!
To paraphrase a recent comment offered by Stephen Poloz, Chief Economist, Export Development Canada: the bottom line is that despite all the superlatives being used to describe Dubai (and by extension, the Emirates as a whole), it still has the capacity to surprise.
For the Arab region as a whole, the Council of the Arab Common Market released its forecast in 2006 of the expected gap between demand and what is available in food product supplies.
By 2010, the gap will widen to 61 million tonnes (t), including the need for 28 million t of flour, 7 million t of sugar, 5 million t of edible oils, 15 million t of meat, and 7 million t of milk and dairy products.
The gap will result from both increased population growth and rising per capita income in the region...and Dubai remains well-positioned both with the needed infrastructure and expertise to service the imports (and re-exporting) needed to meet this demand.
So back to Sheikha Lubna...is there no fly in the ointment, no caveat which might benefit from a little more "governmental" attention...is it all easy gravy for those choosing to do business here.
Well not exactly.
This is not a market without its specific challenges.
It is worth noting, for example, that the World Bank's most recent (Fall 2006) global ranking on the ease of doing business in 175 countries ranked the UAE a lowly 77th.
Indeed, the UAE placed only 5th among 17 countries, in the Middle East-North Africa (MENA) region.
The ranking is based on 10 factors used to assess the regulatory environment and its conduciveness to doing business.
To provide you with an idea of the range, Singapore ranked first, the U.S. and Canada were 3rd and 4th respectively, China 93rd and India at 134.
And agri-food exports to this market are not exempt from the challenges presented in this regard.
Whether it involves trying to get additional Canada-based halal certifiers approved, or promoting Canadian wines, or the legal need to secure an Emirati partner (now being changed), or the challenging "shelf-life" dating requirements, etc., it is not a market for the impatient...and building personal relationships over time is fundamental to any meaningful success.
So does all of this mean anything when it comes to Canadian agri-food exporters' potential interests in this market?
We would suggest yes, and as an astute friend once taught me..."always give them three things" : 1.
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) members (i.e., Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the UAE) are generally booming along for a variety of reasons, not the least of which are oil revenues.
One key strategic principle which underlies and promotes Dubai's growth is that it is designed to be a distribution hub within the region.
With respect to agriculture and food products this focus has been and remains an ever growing reality, with redistribution occurring not only within the Gulf and Middle East, but reaching further-flung markets such as Iran, Iraq, Russia, India and Pakistan to name but a few.
The considerable investment in state-of-the-art infrastructure to achieve this end has occurred and continues to be upgraded.
In short, Dubai (and the UAE) is far more than solely an export destination in its own right.
Canadian agri-food exports to the UAE now have a "momentum" to be capitalized on.
At time of writing, our export levels by the end of November 2006 were up an impressive 330% over our total exports for 2005.
The range of opportunities run across the board from 5-star hotels, to a more-than-doubling of cruise ship tourist visits expected next year, to the huge expat worker camps, continued growth the well-heeled westpat "immigration" whether as professionals or retirees...in short, they all gotta eat!
This first issue of TRENDS...food in the UAE will explore some of the many trade development and trade policy considerations at play which, from our perspective, currently shape the UAE market.
Hopefully, the reader will find some of the matters touched upon to be of direct interest, or more likely, will be encouraged to think laterally with respect to how the issues and opportunities identified might apply to his/her products or ideas, even though not directly treated herein.
Much of the statistical information contained in TRENDS has been gathered from secondary sources.
All views expressed are those of the authors alone, and are not to be confused with Government of Canada policy on any given matter.
TRADE/MARKET ACCESS This newsletter is largely oriented to market trends and trade development opportunities.
However, we assume that an overview of the trade policy issues and initiatives, which provide some context for this market, would be useful to those interested in pursuing its many opportunities.
The statistics bear it out, the UAE's foreign trade has made impressive strides in recent years.
Commodity exports are expected to top C$170 billion, growing by 21% from 2005, with oil's share forming 40% of these exports.
Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) - for an essentially small country, the UAE is involved in an aggressive array of trade negotiations both bilaterally and as a member of the GCC.
A number of these negotiations are with suppliers that compete directly with Canada.
Even though at time of writing, the UAE had yet to sign a formal FTA with any of its trade partners either bilaterally or through the GCC, a number agreements border on reaching a conclusion.
On the bilateral front, negotiations between the UAE and the U.S. continue.
Although these talks appeared to be moving relatively quickly, they reached a hiatus around March (2006).
A few specific challenges not related to the agriculture, fish or food sectors, slowed things down (i.e., telecommunications and inward investment for the UAE, and a U.S. preoccupation with the Emirates' labour policies and employment conditions).
And although both sides soft-pedal the issue, the Dubai Ports (DP) World fiasco also slowly seeped into the two countries' commercial relationship, and did little to enhance the negotiating mood.
With U.S. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) expiring at the beginning of July 2007, and the results of the 2006 mid-term elections having re-shaped Congress, one would further assume that there would be little appetite in the U.S. Administration to expend the considerable political capital necessary (if even possible) to now push various potential trade agreements through the House and Senate.
In practical terms, a deal with the UAE would have to be wrapped-up by late March, if there is to be any real hope of getting it through Congress before the end of June, when TPA expires.
UAE bilateral negotiations were also underway with Australia and Singapore, but have now been transferred to the GCC level.
As with the U.S., we assume that any eventual GCC deal with Australia will include the agricultural sector, essentially for the same reasons as it would with the U.S. In short, it's a win-win given the UAE's (and Gulf generally) food deficit situation, and U.S./Australia's strong agri-food export orientation.
However, it will be interesting to see how the Emirates attempt to protect some of their smaller, less efficient food industries (e.g., dairy products), given that any eventual FTAs, with any trade partner having an agri-food export interest, would force the UAE to eliminate its restrictive protection measures (most notably the use of production/shelf-life dating in this regard).
On the multilateral front, as a member of the GCC, the UAE also finds itself involved in a raft of multilateral negotiations.
In addition to Singapore and Australia, these are underway with the EU, China, Pakistan and India.
The EU negotiations started in 1990, and have proceeded in various fits-and-starts since initiation.
The EU is the GCC's largest trading partner, and the GCC is the fifth largest market for EU products.
Senior level Emirati political pressure (e.g., most recently the publicised efforts of Sheikha Lubna, the highly regarded Minister of Economy) urging the EU to speed up GCC free trade talks, continues to mount.
As well, negotiations with China and India got underway in 2004 and 2005 respectively.
More recently, Singapore and the GCC announced that they would begin FTA talks early in 2007.
Other countries including Japan, Turkey, New Zealand, Switzerland/EFTA (in parallel with the EU's negotiations), Pakistan, Korea, Thailand, Jordan and potentially Azerbaijan, have all now expressed interest in or intent to begin FTA negotiations on a GCC basis.
And as a final aside, we would note that within the GCC, the U.S. has concluded bilateral FTAs with Oman, Bahrain, and more widely within the region with Jordan, Morocco and Israel.
Although all were not initiated by President Bush, each agreement is a supportive plank in his declared goal of establishing a Middle Eastern Free Trade Area (MEFTA).
However as noted above, the reconstituted November 2006 Congress will likely impede furtherance of this objective.
The bilaterals with Oman and Bahrain created considerable consternation within the GCC, notably with Saudi Arabia...the regional heavyweight, arguing that the FTAs violate the GCC customs union.
This perceived undermining of GCC solidarity may also play in to the UAE's current negotiations with the U.S. Trade Policies - the UAE has been a Contracting Party to the GATT since 1994, and subsequently a Member of the WTO in 1996.
It grants at least MFN tariff treatment to all its trade partners, except Israel, and saw the customs union component of the GCC (i.e., a common tariff for all 6 members) take effect in 2003.
The UAE has never been involved in any trade litigation under the WTO's Dispute Settlement Mechanism.
The WTO published its first Trade Policy Review for the UAE in 2006.
The report provides a comprehensive review of all UAE domestic policies that could affect trade, as well as sector policy profiles including agriculture and related activities.
This overview is freely available through the WTO's website at http://docsonline.wto.org/gen_home.asp (see document WT/TPR/S/162, March 20, 2006).
PORK As a Muslim country, one is of course excused to assume a very limited (if any!) market in the UAE for pork products.
The market is stratified into several segments: retail outlets drawing on the resident expat community which, in turn, represents 80% of the population base; tourist/business visitors which (along with healthy portion of the resident expat community) fuel a vibrant and growing hotel and restaurant sector; and other market outlets which also continue to grow (e.g., ship chandlers, catering, U.S. military installations in the region, etc.). In our Fall visits to key UAE importers with Canada Pork International, a number of salient observations arose.
At retail, the bulk of frozen product is purchased by Filipinos, who tend to be largely employed in the service industries.
Price is the dominant factor in sourcing product for this group.
There are only 3 retailers licensed to sell pork to the public (i.e., Spinneys, T. Choithrams & Sons Ltd., and Lal's)...notably, Carrefour does not hold a licence.
The western expat sub-community (westpat), particularly the growing number of European professionals rotating through, as well as retirees settling in the UAE, suggests continuing growth in demand at the retail level for chilled cuts and processed pork products.
This could represent an initially modest opportunity for Canadian suppliers.
However, when coupled with an explosion in further hotel capacity expected over the next 10 years (i.e., plenty more tourists and additional demand for high-end "real" pork and bacon products), this could be coupled with foodservice and catering sector demand and build into a more substantive opportunity for those suppliers willing to invest the time needed to build the business relationships fundamental to this market.
Indeed, Dubai will have some 41,500 hotel rooms by the end of 2006, and experts are projecting 86,600 rooms by 2016.
Although prescribed mandatory retail shelf-lives can pose a challenge in servicing the retail sector (i.e., especially when it comes to chilled product), air cargo transportation links from Canada are continuously improving, and should be able to minimize the effects of this limitation.
As well, the limited time-window prescribed under UAE regulations for any food products "dating" requirement (i.e., "produced on..." and "expiry on..." ), does not apply to the foodservice sector.
BEEF So how is Canada's competition doing in the UAE market?
There are clearly a number of reasons undermining Canada's beef presence in retail coolers/freezers and on restaurant menus.
However, with the UAE's December 2005 acceptance of beef from Canadian animals (i.e., under thirty months of age), and continued efforts to have additional Canadian halal certifiers approved, we hopefully look forward to Canadian beef in this market over the medium term.
This market wants beef.
For example, Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) announced (Fall 2006) that the demand and consumption of Australian beef per month has nearly doubled in the UAE.
A year ago, about 10-12 tonnes of Aussie beef were consumed per month, but the amount has now shot up to about 20 tonnes per month, in a market that consumes a total of some 100 tonnes per month.
The MLA argues that it is their extensive investment in and commitment to offering a top quality product which has gone a long way in making their beef the ingredient of choice for chefs and patrons alike in most higher-end dining and steakhouse establishments.
This commitment has also been bolstered by a number of other factors at play in the UAE market itself: high disposable incomes, liberal trade policies, zero or low import duties, and of course, a very limited local production of meat.
The general prosperity enjoyed in the market, as well as the growing numbers of working women, has meant eating-out is a fast growing trend.
As well, another important and visible reason (according to the MLA) is the continuing huge construction boom with a host of international hotel chains all offering fine dining experiences, causing the demand for quality beef to grow exponentially.
In the words of one Australian exporter whose volumes to this part of the world have doubled in two years "...who would have said two years back that we would be serving Wagyu in most parts of the Middle East today."
The anticipated growth in hotel accommodation over the next number of years is noted in several places in this report, and underlies a lot of the continued growth expected in the UAE's foodservice industry.
Dubai for example, aims to attract 6.8 million tourists in 2007, with an objective of reaching 10 million by 2010.
FISH There's no shortage of demand for fish in the Emirates, from the needs of the growing numbers of 5-star hotel-restaurants aiming to satisfy the palates of their discriminating clienteles, to fresh (and in some cases live) fish markets catering to nationals and resident expats, to extensive fresh fish counters in all the major retail chains.
In terms of a domestic industry, fishing in the UAE is carried out mainly at an artisanal level.
On the supply side of fresh fish, the country is considered self-sufficient, with a catch of around 115,000 tonnes (1998), which includes pelagics, demersals and migratory species at given times of the year.
Modern large fishing boats are prohibited in coastal waters in order to preserve the coastal environment, as well as fishermen's interests.
Per capita fish consumption of UAE nationals is estimated at 33 kg.
This is high relative to other Arab countries and the world as a whole (FAO world estimate of 16.5 kg in 2003).
The full gamut of frozen fish products (including bagged IQF shrimp in all sizes from around the world) are readily available at retail.
The range of more highly processed products is also extensive, originating from EU-based processors, South Africa, Australia, Malaysia, Oman and other suppliers.
Likewise, there is also an established market and consumer demand for smoked salmon and canned products.
In the Fall 2006, a special section of the Dubai fish market opened to cater to consumers seeking live fish.
Emirates Aqua Live is the first such fish outlet in the UAE, and supplies both to individuals, as well as top restaurants.
Their special facility carries all the regional fish, live crabs, lobsters, and others.
Opportunity for Canada?
Canada currently exports a variety of fish and seafood to this market, including fresh and frozen lobster, frozen shrimp, scallops and crab, smoked salmon, and canned fish products, and the opportunities continue growing.
On the supply front, considerable media debate was generated in the Fall (2006) with Dr Worm's (Dalhousie University, N.S.) extensive study published in the journal Science.
As we understand it, the Study essentially argues that should current trends be maintained, seafood could all but disappear from the human diet by 2048.
Within the context of the debate that this gave rise to in the UAE, the Ministry responsible for the fishery submitted that the threat of depleted fish stocks will not affect the UAE.
This the Ministry attributed to the release of more than a half-million hatchery fish a year into the Gulf...and their efforts to release more.
As mentioned above, they also underscored their not allowing "big companies" with trawlers to operate in coastal waters.
For our part, we don' t quite know how to square this with press headlines which scream "Price of local fish hits the roof" , and "Fish export ban imposed as traders struggle to meet demand" ...but we suppose that's simply our failing!
HALAL PRODUCTS Halal literally means "what is permissible" under Islam.
Halal food must be free of alcohol, pork and other prohibited substances.
In addition, meat and meat products must be from animals slaughtered according to Islamic guidelines.
Some recent reports have argued that most food companies in the region have not understood the direction the global halal market is taking, and they will have to adapt if they wish to eke out a share of this growing market by adopting contemporary industry trends.
Analysts note that food companies in most Middle Eastern countries take their consumers for granted.
Compared to buying halal food in other countries, consumers in overwhelmingly Muslim countries are seen as accepting what is on offer without raising too many questions.
The halal food-wave has already happened in Southeast Asia, Europe and Africa.
They suggest that it is just starting in the Arab world, and consumers are becoming more conscious of halal branding of food products.
It is believed that consumers in the region will buy halal products from non-Arab companies, if they do not find the properly certified products on their grocery shelves.
A study puts the global retail market for halal food at between US$400-580 billion a year (i.e., based on per capita expenditures on food by Muslims).
A breakdown of the 1.5 billion Muslim consumers around the world suggests both a substantial Middle Eastern market, as well as opportunities for re-export from Dubai to other impressive market sizes (180 million in Indonesia, 140 million in India, 130 million in Pakistan, 200 million in the Middle East, 300 million in Africa, 14 million in Malaysia, and over 8 million in North America).
September 2006 saw the successful introduction of a new "halal" trade show, DIHAS 2006, in Dubai.
Although only 60 companies, mostly from Malaysia, exhibited at this inaugural event, the venture appears to hold promise for this growing segment and will run again in 2007.
At time of writing, the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) is the only Canadian halal certifying body that has been approved to certify for export to the UAE.
However, efforts continue with the objective of obtaining approval for additional Canadian certifiers.
ORGANICS AND OTHER HEALTHFUL MATTERS Organics - domestically at the farm production level in the UAE, the Ministry responsible for agriculture is encouraging the pursuit of organic farming, mainly as an environmentally friendlier alternative to current practices.
The answer is a resounding "no" . Organic products are evident in most retail food product categories, and Canada continues to build a steady presence in this segment.
Canadian breakfast cereals, granola bars, jams and wild rice are readily available on the "organic" supermarket shelves.
We believe that opportunities exist for a greater presence in this niche segment.
The December 2006 publication of Canada's Organic Products Regulations will now underpin consumers' confidence against false organic claims, and govern the use of a new "Canada Organic" logo.
Organic exporters will now be able to compete on a far stronger footing internationally with the over 40 other countries worldwide that have enacted organic regulations.
Coupled with this regulatory framework is the launch in 2007 of a four-year pilot project to track Canadian trade data on organic products...a world first!
Having this information available will prove valuable in measuring both performance and demand for these products in various markets.
In short, these newest of tools auger well for the promotion of this specialised horizontal cross-sector in the global marketplace, including the UAE of course.
Diabetes - one in every four UAE adults is believed to be affected by diabetes according to the UN's World Health Organization (WHO).
This rate is one of the highest incidence in the world.
Both diabetes and childhood obesity are major health concerns, and the two go largely hand-in-hand, with Type II diabetes (i.e., usually referred to as "adult onset" diabetes) now growing far more common among younger individuals.
Some 96% of the UAE's diabetic population are Type II which, although not insulin dependant, requires close management through proper food intake (i.e., given a diet's significant role in helping control blood-sugar levels).
Indeed, WHO has estimated UAE youths to be 2-3 times more obese than the international standard, and the link between being overweight and diabetes is generally unquestioned.
This unfortunate situation does however present a number of opportunities for Canada.
These can be seen not only in terms of specialty products aimed specifically at this particular segment, but more significantly for products that are not only helpful to diabetics, but support good nutrition principles for the population as a whole.
Notable in this latter area is the success enjoyed by Canadian pulse exporters which, at time of writing, have seen there exports to the UAE rise by over 100% when compared to last year alone.
As a staple, pulses find themselves well positioned as "low" on the Glycaemic Index (GI) scale1, a feature which is particularly helpful to diabetics, but no less healthful for the population at large.
As Canada's pulse export base to this market grows, promoting this key aspect of certain [Canadian] peas, beans and lentils will take on added significance in terms of positively identifying Canada with healthy foods.
The same notion also applies to products like breakfast cereals based on oats, barley or bran, breads with whole-grains, stone ground flour, and the like.
For example, the recent arrival of Catelli's Healthy Harvest whole-wheat pasta line at retail in this market is illustrative of our ability to capitalize on this growing segment, as are the Nature's Path line of cereals.
This potential edge is not being lost on other exporters to the UAE as well.
Sona Pearl Nutri Rice is a new "scientifically engineered" low GI, aromatic rice marketed to "health conscious adults and children."
At a GI rating of 44, it is promoted as being less than half the level of most other rices.
Other available products on grocery shelves include the likes of Scotland's Nairn's line of oat biscuits and oat cakes.
They are clearly labelled on their front panel as to their "medium GI" or "low GI" ranking.
Cargill has also entered the growing movement to the low GI approach by announcing its recent introduction of a new food sweetening ingredient, XTENDTM Isomaltulose.
It delivers both glucose and fructose (with their full energy), but they are released over a longer period of time.
Maple syrup - yes, that Canadian stalwart is well represented on grocery shelves, and yes it does feel a little strange following a piece on diabetic foods with a comment on maple syrup.
However, the popular press has drawn UAE consumers' attention to the "London phenomenon" of significant success in weight-loss dieting by drinking maple syrup.
We understand that London health food shops are reporting a massive surge in sales since pop-idol Beyonce (I' ll have to ask my daughter!) said she used it to loose weight in her latest film.
Apparently, dieters mix the syrup (made from maple and palm tree sap) with water, lemon juice and cayenne pepper, and drink it instead of eating meals.
London-based Planet Organics sell it as a detox product, but customers soon noticed they could loose weight quickly with the concoction as well.
I won' t venture any further at this point, nor hazard a guess as to whether this phenom will catch on widely here as it has done in Europe...other than to note that this Canadian of Canadian products has received considerable media attention in the Emirates on the healthful eating side of the ledger.
We eagerly consumed gallons of the stuff.
Now, as the media reports in this market, the Minnesota Medical Association has opened a new front in the war on obesity.
Apple, orange and other juices are blamed in part for the fattening of America's children.
In a somewhat less than vigorous defence, one expert from the Institute of Medicine (Washington, DC) noted that "...[juice] is probably more nutritious than drinking water."
Well again, who are we to get caught up in the arguments of the nutrition experts.
We would note that fruit juice is not only a children's drink in the UAE, but also an adult social staple in this Islamic environment.
There is no dinner, reception, or other event where ample quantities of a wide and exotic array of fruit juices are not being consumed.
Simply put, fresh fruit juice is ubiquitous in this part of the world.
Although the reported study findings did receive considerable media attention, it is hard to imagine at this stage that demand for juices will abate in any significant way.
In fact, a UAE-based market research report found that consumers here are drinking more juice products, approaching 50 litres per annum, with emphasis remaining on pure juices and nectars.
So, during the limited review period covered by this newsletter...on the healthful side in the UAE, that's apparently a thumbs-up to maple syrup, and a thumbs-down to fruit juices...interesting, but who might have guessed?
Honey - in yet another media splash focussing this time on honey, also a great Canadian product, a New Zealand biochemist visited the UAE market to persuade health officials to put away the antibiotics and "...use the sweet stuff to heal injuries."
More specifically, the product that is being brought to the UAE combines honey with a cloth-like material derived from seaweed (which Canada also has plenty of) that dissolves away without leaving any threads to fester in a wound.
We might sound a little apprehensive about the good Professor since the event that started him off on his quest was his use of bull semen, given its anti-bacterial properties, and that he first used honey when he accidentally cut himself with a chain saw...but there you go.
The Professor is reported to have publicly volunteered to offer his advice freely to any company that wants to do anything seriously.
In our bid to have Canada at the forefront of neutriceuticals and the like, we say what's the harm in investigating further!
In terms of more traditional uses, a very wide range of honeys are available on retail shelves, both by type/flower origin and country source (e.g., U.S., Germany, UK, Australia, NZ, China, in addition to Gulf-product from Oman and Saudi Arabia).
Honey has always been an important diet component in this part of the world, and is also traditionally served during Ramadan observances.
In fact, the Qur' an states that in honey there is healing...and it is the only mention in the Holy Book of a food item in this context.
Its sweetening characteristics are used widely, from tea to yogurt.
In short, it's a competitive well-serviced market, with little technically preventing Canadian honey from being a player.
RETAIL There's no mistaking it, the UAE is a shoppers' heaven!
Residents and visitors alike pound the retail corridors relentlessly...in fact recent AC Nielsen figures estimate some 492 million cumulative person-hours are spent annually by UAE residents in hypermarkets and supermarkets alone.
In case you' re a reader attracted by factoids of dubious value, that's equivalent to the hours that would be spent constructing 70 Empire State buildings a year.
And speaking of the U.S., Dubai has four times the shopping area per capita when compared to Canada's southern neighbours.
The average UAE consumer spends some 127 hours in supermarkets per year, and embarks on shopping trips nearly 4 times every week.
Retail, and food retailing in particular, is economically important and highly competitive.
Retail prices - as a non-Muslim outsider, initial exposure to some of the practices which surround the holy month of Ramadan (expected to be September 12 to October 11 in 2007) gives rise to some unexpected, yet interesting food-related phenomena.
Readers would have knowledge of the sunrise-to-sunset fasting element observed throughout the month.
However, we assume few would have given significant thought as to what happens once the sun falls.
One can readily appreciated that once the fasting day ends, practitioners of the faith would understandably want to eat.
However, the nature of this fast-breaking, the importance attached to the evening's plentiful and celebratory meal (Iftar), how this is often done as a "community" of one type or another (be it family, friends, or any other groupings on a given night), and of course the role food plays in this daily occurrence, are all adjuncts that impact the food sector.
These centre on the placing of significant peak-load demands on the various sub-sectors (retail, foodservice, catering), that must respond nightly in terms of quality, variety and quantity of food products.
In turn, these considerations present both many challenges and opportunities on the food supply, distribution and sales systems.
At the retail level, the print media (for one) closely follows retail prices and reports on same in considerable detail.
Factions argue that 50-100% increases in fruit and vegetable prices, for example, are a result of retailers falling prey to monopoly wholesalers...while others counter-argue that it's simply the acting out of basic market forces.
So, for roughly a 30-day period, food is a key component of media attention touching on everything from public health and the best ways to break a fast, to traffic safety (not a small issue in Dubai) with headlines like "Avoid speeding in rush to break your fast, say police!" , to reviews of restaurants'special offerings, to import policy where in 2006, the UAE's Ministry of Economy moved to allow the unrestricted importation of basic food items in order to avoid price manipulation, to even having the leadership murmuring about the need for food price caps (which even though not implemented, is not inconceivable when one considers that a number of the emirates have recently moved to freeze soaring rents for example).
Why is this of any relevance to potential Canadian exporters?
Well, largely because it's a lead-in to "pricing" and availability at the retail level.
In short, the UAE government produces a retail price survey on a weekly basis, which is widely reported on.
The calculations are based on a basket of 44 items considered as "essential" (although that term appears to be a little loosely defined).
The UAE produces only 12 of these 44 items.
Most of the local items include fresh meat and dairy products and some produce.
Chicken, beef and eggs are all produced in the UAE, as well as pasta, tomato paste and sugar.
Cucumbers and packaged beef samosas round out the list of locally produced items.
Although these relatively few items are produced in the UAE, they must also face aggressive competition from imports as well.
It's simply another illustration of the food-deficit situation this part of the world finds itself in.
Private labelling - the rapid expansion of supermarket and hypermarket space across the Middle East finds private labelling to be alive, well and growing in the retail food sector.
UAE food+ cooperatives on the other hand, are ahead in terms of actual purchase percentages.
In the UAE, private labels now represent more than 15% of supermarkets' grocery turnover.
Continued new growth - pioneering French retail giants Carrefour and Casino are making the biggest investments in Middle East food retailing, with several other regional retailers trying to follow suit.
In 1995, Carrefour acquired its first store in Dubai (as the result of a buy-out), thereby bringing the "hypermarket" concept to the Middle East.
For the next six years, Carrefour essentially had free rein up until 2001 when the first Géant, from the French-owned Groupe Casino, opened in Bahrain.
Since then, Géant-branded hypermarkets have opened in Lebanon (1), Saudi Arabia (5) and Dubai (1).
Plans have been announced to rollout further stores, especially in Saudi Arabia.
With an estimated US$1 billion turnover in the Middle East, Carrefour is not sitting idly by.
From its initial foothold in the UAE, the brand now has upwards of 20 stores, most recently culminating in the largest hypermarket in the region located in Dubai (2005).
It is planning a raft of additional outlets (i.e., Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Beirut, Cairo, Alexandria, Amman, possibly more in the UAE, and perhaps Iran).
But the cornerstone of the chain's future development in the region appears to be its ambitious plans for Saudi Arabia.
Carrefour is reported to want to launch more than 20 additional stores in the Kingdom over the next 10 years.
Their presence in the UAE now includes 10 stores.
The following table provides readers with a concrete idea of the relative size and ranking of only those major grocery retailers that also have operations in the UAE.
Understandably, the 2005 retail "banner sales" (in million US$s) used for the ranking, relates to each chain's total sales across Middle East/North Africa, and is not to be confused with their respective total sales in the UAE: 1.
Al Maya 159 Considerable media attention was paid in 2006 to Harrods' reported plans to establish a presence on the Dubai retail scene.
Famous branded stores are of course already very present in Dubai (e.g., Harvey Nichols...which features B.C.'s CANAQUA spring water, Saks Fifth Avenue, Marks & Spencer, etc.). However, what caught our attention was that Harrods was reportedly going to enter solely as a "food and well-being" retailer under the Harrods 102 name (i.e., their relatively new convenience/high-end concept food store chain in the UK), rather than introduce its full London department store format.
Although analysts were predicting that Harrods would initially focus on high quality convenience foods, subsequent media reporting suggests that Harrods' entry into the UAE market is not imminent.
In November, Marks & Spencer announced intentions to expand its current 4-store presence in the UAE as part of its global plans to open 15 new international stores in 2006...and as we all know, where M&S goes, their extensive line of quality St. Michael branded food products follows.
Canadian products - as the growth in Canada's agri-food export statistics to the UAE might suggest, the good news is that keeping tabs on new products showing up on retail grocery shelves is a growing challenge.
The well-established ranks of McCain frozen potato products, Baskin Robbins ice cream, assorted pulses, Nature's Path organic breakfast cereals, canola oil, Connors Bros' Bumble Bee brand canned fish products, wild rice and maple syrup...to name a few, are constantly being added to.
Most recent new arrivals have seen for example the Catelli line of whole grain pasta products, and CANAQUA bottled water.
In short, UAE importers/distributors we are in contact with continue to be enthused by Canadian products and are very welcoming, indeed encouraging of the Canadian presence.
HRI/FOODSERVICE The market - the Middle Eastern foodservice market is estimated to be worth more than US$31 billion annually, of which the GCC countries account for almost US$9.5 billion.
The UAE foodservice market alone was worth US$4.36 billion (2004), and is conservatively predicted to grow at 11% for 2005 and 2006.
Dubai and Abu Dhabi account for 80% of total foodservice demand amongst the seven emirates.
In addition to the UAE resident population's considerable expenditures in this sector, latest economic studies estimate total spending by tourists will reach US$7.6 billion in 2009, which is expected to be the highest consumption rate in the GCC...and at three meals a day plus snacking on the run, the foodservice segment will attract its own significant portion of that total outlay.
Asian cuisine is the most popular of all cuisines and is growing the fastest.
Lebanese food is also continuing to be popular as it suits Arabic tastes and is also relatively healthy.
Coffee chains are also showing excellent growth, and Canada-based operations are very active in this segment with franchises like Second Cup, Café Suprême, Blenz, Café Céramique, and most recently Java U from Montréal, all present in the market.
These 4 channels make up roughly two-thirds of total foodservice expenditure on their food inputs and supplies.
Based on research interviews carried out with distributors in the UAE, the fastest growing categories in the segment are poultry, lamb/mutton, fresh fruit and vegetables, and processed meat and poultry (i.e., halal).
Also noteworthy is the increasing popularity of low-fat versions of products, Asian sauces and ingredients, bakery products, coffee and specialty cheeses.
The major factors supporting growth in the UAE's foodservice industry include: population growth, currently averaging over 7% per annum; rising rates of private consumption expenditure which also have the effect of driving up foodservice expenditures; three-quarters of the population are non-nationals, with a large percentage of this segment being male bachelors (in fact, males outnumber females two-to-one); given the prevalent working lifestyle, most people are compelled to eat at least one meal per day while at work; and finally, the impact of well over 6 million (and climbing relentlessly) tourist visits annually...hotels alone account for 17% of total foodservice expenditure.
In fact, Dubai has set a target of attracting 10 million tourists in 2010.
And for those wanting yet another different spin on the hotel room growth number, one of the world's leading hotel investments services projects that 55,000 luxury four and five-star hotel rooms are expected to be completed in the next 5 years across the UAE.
By comparison, Las Vegas is second with a construction pipeline currently at 42,000 rooms, and Macao (third) at 27,000.
Canada appears well-positioned to take advantage of a number of opportunities in this market segment.
These would range from supplying inputs to the highly price sensitive fast food component (e.g., from canola seed for crushing and use as frying oil, wheat for milling and baking, frozen potato products, etc.), to important opportunities apparent in the hotel segment where premium fish and seafood products, high quality beef and yes, pork, all come readily to mind.
Fast foods - according to several analysts, traditional fast food outlets stand to face increased competition from companies billing themselves as both "fast" and "healthy".
They are all eager for a slice of the UAE's US$117 million fast food market.
We know that in North America and Europe, the trend for some years has seen consumers gravitating towards what they consider as healthier eating alternatives.
And so, as Dubai's consumer base becomes increasingly westpat-oriented, there could well be emulation in terms of a steady shifting away from traditional "fast foods" , towards those healthier alternatives as well.
In support of this thesis, some analysts suggest that consumers' health concerns explain, at least in part, the somewhat unspectacular growth in UAE fast food outlets.
They only reached 315 this year, when compared to 275 in 2003.
Sushi, Gourmet Burger and Australian brand Sumo Salad have either been introduced to the UAE, or are on their way to do battle in their efforts to save consumers' midriffs against this segment's well-established McDonald's, Burger King, KFC, Pizza Hut, bulwark.
Despite growing health awareness, experts say there remains immense scope for growth in the UAE's fast food market.
Aware of this potential, McDonald's for example (with its 43 restaurants to date in the UAE), has introduced several meals directly targeting the Mid-East market, such as the McArabia grilled kofta and grilled chicken.
Gross Leasable Area (i.e., the retail space which is available to rent to tenants) per capita in the UAE is currently reported at the 0.98 mark.
Compare this to the U.S. average of about 1.9 and it seems evident to analysts that there is plenty of room for mall and non-mall retail growth, and by extension, plenty of room for growth in the fast food segment.
Analysts predict with some confidence that the future room for growth will follow the growth trend of the malls...and the latter remains indeed very bullish.
Franchising - tourism and population growth across the Middle East are creating new opportunities for the region's US$14 billion franchise sector.
For example, Dunkin' Donuts, the world's largest coffee and baked goods chain, has recently announced it intends to open 15 new outlets in the UAE alone during 2007.
This U.S. franchise has operated in the region for more than 10 years, and the additions will bring their regional presence to some 50 outlets.
In the UAE, a number of Canadian eatery franchises are in the process of, or have already, established themselves.
Second Cup, Blenz, Café Suprême, Java U and Café Céramique have been previously mentioned, but New York Fries, Saint Cinnabon, and Cinnzeo are also illustrative...with Dixie Lee chicken soon to open as well.
INVESTMENT As most can readily appreciate, a quick look around Abu Dhabi or Dubai provides immediate evidence that the Emirates are beneficiaries of huge investment capital inflows.
Many of the world's multinationals, across all sectors, continue to aggressively take advantage of the growth phenomenon that is the Emirates, as well as the Gulf more generally.
Over the last decade, the UAE has made significant strides and achieved the largest regional foreign direct investment (FDI) in terms of magnitude, rising from a lowly 90th position worldwide in 1995, to rank 15th in 2005.
However, there's also ample evidence that UAE companies are actively investing abroad as well.
Again this straddles most sectors, from real estate and hotel properties, sport franchises, port facilities, to agriculture and food.
In terms of outward investment, the media has India touted as the current "greatest opportunity."
That doesn't mean that one is not barraged on a daily basis by near-constant news of mega-high profile deal announcements in other parts of the world.
These range from constant rumours of purchasing Liverpool FC (a deal with an expected price tag of over C$1 billion, and for which the bidding has been against George Gillett, owner of the Montréal Canadiens), Emirates Airlines heavy investment in Arsenal's new football stadium, plus a C$200 million FIFA sponsorship, acquisition of the Tussaud Group theme parks (C$1.7 billion), Travel Lodge hotels (C$1.5 billion), a billion-plus stake in Daimler-Chrysler, Istithmar's plans to spend over C$8 billion in media and manufacturing in Europe and North America, and on-and-on...from C$700 million investments in the centre of Beirut, to C$20 billion in Egypt's tourism development projects, to International Schools in Singapore, to Moroccan agriculture.
The news barrage on this front is endless.
For many decades, many Indian's seeking to advance themselves economically looked to the UAE.
Full of entrepreneurial skills, they were eager to invest their efforts in making the vision crafted for Dubai a reality.
And now we are witness to a steady stream of investment flowing in the opposite direction.
India's retail sector stands at C$250 billion and growing at 5-7% a year.
Carrefour (Europe's largest and world's second largest retailer) is in talks with Dubai's Landmark Group about opening up to 200 stores in India over the next 10 years.
This foray would take advantage of India's lack of a major international food retailing chain despite the growing demand of the expanding middle class for quality and variety from food retailers.
It would also dovetail nicely with India's 30% annual growth in "organized retail", notably malls.
By contrast, the UK's TESCO has seen its India plans skid to a halt as its negotiations with an Indian joint venture partner (Bharti Enterprises) came to an abrupt end.
Bharti is now aligning itself with Wal-Mart.
The point of all this is simple.
The UAE both welcomes investment, but likewise appreciates the importance of balancing risk by looking to invest aggressively around the world and across a wide range of sectors as well.
In this respect, it clearly presents an interesting opportunity for sourcing potential FDI in the Canadian agri-food sector.
TREND-BITS... random food for thought!
New products - after 20 years of intensive scientific research at the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory (Dubai), Emirates Industry for Camel Milk & Products has released its first camel milk product "Camelicious" to the UAE market.
Indeed, the date-flavoured version is claimed as a world-first.
So you ask, of what possible significance is this to Canadian agri-food exporters?
Well, the product launch picked-up extensive media coverage in late 2006, and although taste panel results (largely among expats) were mixed, the marketing focus plays generously on one of the recurring themes in this newsletter...health and nutritional awareness of products will continue growing in the UAE, and will increasingly become an important food marketing tool.
Will your humble servant try it?
You betcha... eventually!
Horses - December 2006 saw a fulsome Canadian equestrian industry participation as exhibitors within a Canada Pavilion at the Al Fares Equine Trade Fair (Dubai).
The Fair, which is considered the number 1 exhibition for horse products and services in Asia and Africa, occurs every two years.
The 2006 event included the largest Canadian presence yet with some nine exhibitors, as well as two Canadian expert speakers contributing to the various seminars held at the venue.
Animal welfare - yes, the animal rights element of the sector have begun to make their presence felt in this part of the world as well.
In taking on Australian live sheep exports (some 230,000 per annum) to the UAE, U.S.-based PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) lobbied at the Ministerial level, arguing that the week-long journey is not halal.
PETA's same campaign in Qatar likewise received considerable media coverage.
As one would expect, Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA) launched an aggressive rebuttal to PETA's claims, noting that "our colleagues in the Middle East need to be aware that PETA cannot be trusted and this is just another example of the havoc PETA's games cause."
The bottom line is simply that, as in other developed country markets, the animal welfare issue is now also making its way to the Gulf in a visible way.
Cruise ships - those affluent mouths-to-feed just keep on coming.
Dubai's cruise tourism industry is set for a major turn in its fortunes in 2007, after years of slow growth, as the Emirate's modern infrastructure and positive tourism "attitude" attracts more visitors.
Dubai is expected to see 85,000 passenger movements during the 2006-07 winter cruise season, which is more than three times the previous year's arrivals.
The 2007-08 season is projected by the tourism authority at 200,000 visitors via cruise lines.
With a dedicated cruise terminal able to handle two ships simultaneously, the city is trying to position itself as the regional cruise hub.
Goji berries - again with the "health" already!
Media coverage in the Emirates was also afforded this particular berry which grows on Hymalayan vines.
Touted as a "super-fruit" which is claimed to boost sex, fight cellulite and combat cancer, it is packed with nutrients and viewed to be in "a different league" than acclaimed super-fruits like blueberries and black currants.
The growing presence in the UAE market of neutriceuticals, herbals, anti-oxidents, supplements, et al, suggests that it is probably time for Canada's own particular entries (e.g., hemp, flax, vegetable-based Omega 3, etc.), to begin exploring these opportunities as well.
We recommend a visit to the Middle East Natural and Organic Products annual trade show, held in Dubai in December, as a good initial starting point in terms of investigating the potential offered by this segment.
This particular venue brings together all those involved in this industry, directly or indirectly, under one roof.
What's in a name - in Egypt, the name of an influential personality is chosen every year, and is then applied to the finest grade of that year's dates.
This year, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nesrallah's name was chosen by a wide margin for the premium dates, which cost over C$5 per kg...the next lower grade earns about C$2-3 per kg.
Other than being generally interesting, and no, we are not advocating a cause or group in any particular way...we feel that it is probably noteworthy when contemplating markets in this part of the world that there is merit in reflecting on the significance/meaning of one's product "name" or personality-association carefully...the risks and/or rewards for doing so might not always be readily apparent! ...and lastly - in November Huguette Labelle, chair of Transparency International, released that organizations "Corruption Index" for 2006.
We are pleased to report that the Emirates ranked as the least corrupt of the GCC countries, and 31st overall.
I suppose that depends on one's perspective.
For example, Canada ranked 14th and the U.S. 20th, whereas the likes of Israel, South Korea and Brazil/China/India/Mexico/Saudi Arabia (the latter as a group) picked-up rankings of 34, 42 and 70 respectively.
So yes, we believe it to be a relatively solid endorsement of the UAE business environment indeed!
Not all carbohydrate foods are created equal, in fact they behave quite differently in our bodies.
The Glycaemic Index describes this difference by ranking carbohydrates according to their effect on our blood glucose levels.
Choosing low GI carbohydrates - those that produce only small fluctuations in our blood glucose and insulin levels - is considered by experts to be important to long-term health reducing risk of heart disease and diabetes, and is key to sustainable weight loss.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY There were 135 biotechnology companies in Israel in 1999 with a total of $600 million1 in sales, 3800 employees and exports estimated at $550 million.
The biotechnology market is expected to be valued at $1.2 billion in 2000 and $2.6 billion by 2003.
Analysts predict that by 2003, as many as 200-250 companies will be working in this sector and that investments will grow to $1.4 billion.
Pharmaceutical and diagnostics firms represent 72% of the Israeli biotechnology industry.
Israel has one of the world's most skilled and educated work forces, with more doctors, scientists and engineers per capita than any other nation.
The reputation of Israel's work force, as well as lower costs for conducting clinical trials and a history of bringing new products to an advanced stage of development more rapidly than anywhere else in the world, makes Israel an attractive place for foreign companies to conduct clinical trials or establish research partnerships.
There is strong government support for the biotechnology industry within Israel through programs to match research funding, establish technology incubators, and encourage bi-national co-operation.
However, despite a rapidly expanding medical and pharmaceutical industry, the Israeli market is still quite immature and dependent on imported goods.
In order to reduce the costs of medication and encourage more competition in the market, the Health and Justice ministers signed regulations to allow parallel imports of pharmaceuticals in May 2000.
Despite continued opposition from international pharmaceutical companies, the regulations will take effect on September 1, 2000.
Characterized by a high level of competition, Israel is expected to become a centre for the development of pharmaceuticals, especially generic brands.
Best prospects for growth in the industry are in bio-electronics, pharmacogenomics, proteomics, bioinformatics and structure based drug design.
Pure biotechnology drug discovery requires greater investment and a longer development time, postponing marked growth in this sector until the Israeli market matures.

MARKET OVERVIEW Israel is a modern and diverse country of over 6 million people, located on a narrow strip of land along the east shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
With the third-highest growth domestic product (GDP) per capita in the developing world (after Hong Kong and Singapore), Israel ranks as one of the most competitive nations of the 21st century.
While the small size of the Israeli economy has limited the country's capital resource base, the expertise of the work force has proven to be it's most important commodity.
Home to one of the world's most skilled and educated work forces (the majority of whom speak English), Israel has more scientists and engineers per capita than any other nation and approximately 4.5 physicians to every 1000 people.
Israel boasts leading researchers in life sciences, computer technology and engineering who produce a noteworthy 1% of the world's scientific publications.
An estimated 35% of all academic scientists in Israel work in the life sciences field and spend 40-50% of all academic research funding.
By 1997, the biotechnology industry had commercialized 19 products, with 32 in clinical trails awaiting approval, and 50 more at the research and development phase.
There were 135 biotechnology companies in Israel in 1999 (an increase from only 25 companies in 1988), with sales of $600 million and exports estimated at $550 million.
Sales of biotechnology products are expected to top $1.2 billion in 2000 and are forecasted to reach $2.6 billion by 2003.
There were 3800 people employed in the biotechnology sector in 1998, an 8% increase from the previous year.
Analysts predict as many as 200-250 companies working in this sector by 2003, with investments growing to $1.4 billion in the same period.
Pharmaceutical and diagnostics firms represent 72% of the Israeli biotechnology industry; agricultural biotechnology accounts for 20%; and the remainder includes veterinary and environmental applications.
Biopharmaceuticals are the most significant sector of the Israeli biotechnology market.
However, the distinction between traditional pharmaceutical firms and those employing biotechnology in the development of medical products is difficult to establish.
As the science behind biotechnology develops, many traditional pharmaceutical companies are turning their attention to the potential of biotechnology in both product development and manufacturing technologies.
The estimated domestic value of the pharmaceutical market in Israel in 1998 was $1.1 billion, growing at an average rate of about 10% annually.
Sales by domestic manufacturers totalled $1.35 billion in 1998; 50% of total sales were exported.
In spite of a rapidly expanding medical industry, the Israeli market is still quite dependent on imported goods.
Imported pharmaceuticals were approximately 40% of the total market in 1998, or $720 million.
Currently, the vast majority of Israel's pharmaceutical exports are to the United States and the European Union, particularly the United Kingdom, Italy and the Netherlands.
Total exports are forecast to rise to $1.1 billion by 2000 and to more than double to $2.3 billion by 2003.
In 1996, the over-the-counter (OTC) drug market represented 12% of Israel's total national drug market, compared with 20% in the United States and 28% in both France and Germany.
Annual OTC consumption in Israel averages $12 per capita, well below average for most westernized countries.
The OTC market is predicted to be one of the most promising growth sectors in coming years.
There is strong government support for the biotechnology industry within Israel through programs to match research funding, establish technology incubators, and encourage bi-national co-operation (see the Key Contacts section for a complete listing of biotechnology incubators).
The Ministry of Industry and Trade sponsors training projects, or industrial incubators, which partner new immigrants to Israel who have backgrounds in science and technology with experienced Israeli entrepreneurs.
The mentor's role is to assist with the process of moving promising ideas through research and to commercialization.
The program has been very successful, particularly with Russian immigrants who have the technical experience in life sciences, but had not previously been encouraged to pursue individual initiative.
The National Biotechnology Steering Committee, established in 1987, advises the Israeli government on the development of biotechnology, encourages research and entrepreneurial activities, and promotes international co-operation.
Government support also extends beyond research and development to include grants and incentives for start-up costs, marketing and infrastructure development.
The MAGNET program, administered by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, encourages development of innovative generic technologies through collaborations between industry and the scientific community.
MAGNET will underwrite up to 65% of a project's budget.
In 1998, four biotechnology projects received funding under this program.
In 1999, the program received a budget allotment of $300 million over five years.
MAGNET also established a bioinformatics consortium called Da'at to encourage collaboration among 7 companies and 2 academic institutes.
Da'at received funding of $16 million over 5 years.
In order to bridge the gap between basic research and commercialization, the Government has established "national open centres".
The centres work on intermediate strategic research is areas such as protein purification and micro sequencing, genomic technologies and gene therapy, and high-throughput screening technologies.
Projects put through these centres are chosen by a panel that bases its decisions on scientific excellence and future applications.
Canadian companies interested in fostering research and development relationships with Israeli companies are also encouraged to consult the MATIMOP program.
MATIMOP is a public non-profit organization that promotes joint industrial development of advanced technologies.
The program's Web site contains a database outlining co-operative program opportunities that span a range of advanced technologies.
Key Factors Shaping Market Growth In spite of having the scientific know-how and personnel, the Israeli biotechnology industry has yet to achieve the level of maturity and development of its competitors, particularly the United States, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom.
While there has been some progress over the past decade with strong government support and the emergence of several large- and medium-sized firms with sufficient infrastructure to develop and test of drugs, further expansion of the infrastructure is needed, as well as the development of entrepreneurial ability in management.
The Israeli Biotechnology Organization is currently working in co-operation with the Israel Manufacturers' Association in implementing a fast-track management program aimed at matching successful executives with Israeli start-up companies.
Other developments to encourage growth in the biotechnology industry in Israel include the Clal Biotech Fund.
Led by Clal Biotechnology, a group of investors established a $150-million consortium to invest in biotechnology companies in 1998.
The group invested $22 million in Compugen and $3.8 million in Neuro Survival Technologies.
The Clal Biotech Fund is currently examining three investments in foreign companies in the US and Europe.
In addition to the Clal Biotech Fund, Koor Group and the Israel Corporation (among Israel's largest holding companies) have jointly established a $44 million fund dedicated to biotechnology investments.
The Ministry of Science, in cooperation with the Weizmann Institute of Science, established the Israel National Node (INN) for bioinformatics training and support in 2000.
The institute is part of the government's effort to strengthen R&D and manufacturing infrastructures by encouraging closer collaboration between academia and industry.
Israel has a strong reputation for a highly skilled work force, lower costs for conducting clinical trials as well as a history of bringing new products to an advanced stage of development more rapidly than anywhere else in the world.
Israel also has a highly diverse population as a result of years of immigration, providing researchers a heterogenous population for clinical trial research.
Israel also has a well-developed medical infrastructure, universal health insurance system and considerable number of physicians.
Companies from the United States and the European Union are increasingly interested in the research and development environment in Israel, further encouraging growth in the industry.
There are hundreds of biotechnology projects currently being developed in Israel, most of which receive government funding.
A notable change in emphasis in recent years has been a move away from development of diagnostics and agricultural products to research on new pharmaceuticals.
Areas where major advances have been made include the use of molecular modeling to design new and improved drugs, synthetic polyamino acids for drug development, drug delivery techniques and drug design by peptide modification.
In 1998, Israel announced reformed drug import regulations that included major changes in pricing, importing and approvals for new drugs.
As described in more detail below, medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medical Regulations Agency will be approved by the Ministry of Health in Israel much quicker than those that have not received approval.
Further changes, as of February 1999, included allowing parallel drug imports.
In the past, any company registering an imported pharmaceutical with the Ministry of Health had a monopoly on the drug, whereby drugs were imported only by representatives with exclusive agreements with the manufacturer.
In response to proposed changes to allow parallel imports, 15 representatives of international pharmaceutical companies established a non-profit lobbying organization called Pharma Israel to oppose the measure.
The association members argued that medications supplied by the manufacturer ensure the quality of handling, packaging, storage and transportation.
They also argued that parallel imports may threaten intellectual property rights.
The Government argued in return that parallel imports would increase competition in the industry and could reduce the costs of some medications in Israel.
On May 30, 2000, the ministers of Health and of Justice signed regulations allowing parallel imports.
The regulations were signed after Clalit Health Services filed a lawsuit and the High Court of Justice responded by demanding an explanation for the delay.
Despite continued opposition from international pharmaceutical companies, the regulations will take effect on September 1, 2000.
The United States and Germany are Israel's most active scientific collaborators with programs including the Bi-National U.S.-Israel Science Foundation (BSF) and the Germany-Israel Foundation (GIF).
Israel receives the third-largest amount of grant funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health outside the United States.
Opportunities While there is a need for strategic alliance opportunities for small or medium-sized companies, the Israeli National Biotechnology Committee has predicted that new ventures and partnerships will result in sales of $1.1 billion in 2000 and reach $2.6 billion in 2003 - or six times more than 1997 sales.
Israel has a multilingual, immigrant population with cultural, historic and business ties to almost every other nation.
In recent years, over 700 000 immigrants have been absorbed from Russia, 67% of which were previously employed in professional, scientific, engineering or technical positions in the former Soviet Union.
This highly trained scientific elite offers significant growth opportunities in the industry and opportunities for Canadian firms to partner with small and medium-sized Israeli enterprises.
Israeli partners can help Canadian firms with technical expertise and commitment to ongoing research and development to enter the market, through strategic alliances and technology transfer agreements.
Best prospects for growth in the industry are in bio-electronics, bio-informatics, pharmacogenomics, proteomics, and structure based drug design.
Pure biotechnology drug discovery requires greater investment and a longer development time, postponing marked growth in this sector until the Israeli market matures.
Currently, Israeli biotechnology firms tend to sell their technology to international investors or multinational concerns, rather than take the risk to develop the product further.
COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT Local Capabilities In spite of recent growth, the Israeli pharmaceutical market remains relatively small.
The two main producers and importers, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and Agis Industries, have a combined market share of 50-60%.
These and other companies, including Biotechnology General (BTG), Hazera, Interpharm (IPL), Orgenics, and Pharmos, have begun to build critical infrastructure for drug development and testing.
The close co-operation between the manufacturing sector and research institutes, universities and medical centres has resulted in a particularly efficient development of new products from the initial research phase through to manufacturing and marketing.
Characterized by a high level of competition, Israel is expected to become a centre for the development of pharmaceuticals, especially generic brands.
Teva has been particularly successful in the generic drug market.
International Competition By far, the largest biotechnology industry in the world is the United States, with Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Canada following.
More than 90% of advanced biotechnology products on the world market are health related and it is expected that about three quarters of the total world demand for biotechnology will continue to be in the health sector.
World sales of biopharmaceuticals have grown more than seven-fold over the past decade and should exceed $26 billion by 2003.
The biopharmaceutical portion of world prescription drug sales is expected to triple from 5% to 15% by 2005.
Canadian Position The Canadian biotechnology industry has flourished over the last several years.
With almost 500 companies, collective revenues of more than $1.9 billion and research expenditures of more than $1.5 billion, Canada is poised to become a world leader in pharmaceutical research and production.
Canadian pharmaceutical exports to Israel were estimated to be close to 1% of the market in 1997.
Fostering growth in the Canadian biotechnology sector is consistent investment in research and development, financial support by private and public agencies, a solid regulatory framework, strong human resources, and public acceptance of biotechnology-derived products.
In 1999, the Canadian government announced a $550-million increase in health research funding over three years and reinforced biotechnology as an important growth sector for the future.
The funding announcement included the creation of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, $200 million in additional funding for the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, and $150 million in additional funding for Technology Partnerships Canada.
This commitment to biotechnology was strengthened in the federal budget in February 2000 with the announcement of $160 million to fund five genomic science centres across Canada, $900 million for university and hospital research infrastructure and $900 million for additional research chairs at Canadian universities.
The government also allocated $90 million to strengthen Canada's regulatory capacity in the area of biotechnology.
Canada's positive relations with the world's most prominent economies, as well as its global reputation for scientific excellence, give Canadian companies an advantage in expanding their businesses to overseas markets.
Canadian firms are well positioned to provide joint-venture partnerships and commercialization expertise, as well as a broad range of products resulting from Canadian research and development efforts.
Biovail of Mississauga, Ontario has recently signed an agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Israel's largest pharmaceutical company, to develop and market a line of delayed-release drugs produced by Biovail.
In December 1999, Teva signed a letter of intent to acquire Novopharm of Canada from Dan Family Holdings.
The value of the deal is approximately $385 million.
The acquisition did not include Novopharm Biotech and was finalized in June 2000.
Increased access has enhanced the competitiveness of Canadian suppliers to this market.
Canada-Israel Industrial Research and Development Foundation Established in 1994, the Canada-Israel Industrial Research and Development Foundation (CIIRDF) provides companies in either country with an introductory service for the purpose of creating R&D alliances.
The program contributes half of the costs of joint R&D projects (up to $50,000 over one year for approved pilot projects and up to $750,000 over three years to fund approved full-scale projects) for eligible Canadian or Israeli firms operated and headquartered in either Canada or Israel.
At least 30% of the cash costs on any individual project must be spent in either Canada or Israel, contributions are repayable from commercial revenues from the project.
For more information, contact the Canada-Israel Industrial Research and Development Foundation.
Export Development Corporation Export Development Corporation (EDC) offers export financing and insurance to Canadian exporters.
Additionally, insurance can be provided for larger transactions that are subject to the terms and conditions established by the buyer.
EDC prefers to work through letters of credit, bank credits or bank guarantees.
Approval for financing is considered on a case-by-case basis.
Canadian Commercial Corporation The Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC) gives Canadian companies access to financing and better payment terms under the Progress Payment Program (PPP).
The PPP concept was developed as a partnership between major Canadian financial institutions and the CCC.
It enables the exporter's bank to open a project line of credit for the exporter's benefit, based on CCC approval of the project and the exporter's ability to perform.
The CCC will also act as a prime contractor on behalf of Canadian small and medium-sized enterprises, giving those businesses increased credibility and competitive advantage.
The PEMD refundable contribution ranges from $5,000 to a maximum of $50,000.
Preference is given to companies with fewer than 100 employees for a firm in the manufacturing sector and 50 in the service industry, or with annual sales between $250,000 and $10 million.
Other components of the program include international bid preparation (Capital Project Bidding) and, for trade associations, developing international marketing activities for their membership.

PRIVATE-SECTOR CUSTOMERS Israel's 630 privately owned pharmacies represent the second largest group of customers for for pharmaceutical products (the publically funded health-care system is the primary customer).
The two largest drug store chains are SuperPharm and NewPharm.
The public sector consumes 90% of imported and locally produced pharmaceuticals.
Since 1995, health insurance is guaranteed to all Israeli citizens.
All residents are required to register with one of the health care organizations, which provide a standard and extensively subsidized selection of health services and drugs through one of four public "sick funds".
In January 2000, a total of 96 drugs and 22 medical procedures were added to the list for reimbursement and are expected to cost the Israeli government an additional $60 million per year.
The largest of the sick funds is Kupat Holim of the Histadrut (General Sick Fund of the Labour Union), which insures about 65% of the total insured (or about 3.5 million people) and operates about 1200 clinics in Israel.
It is the largest purchaser of drugs in Israel through a centralized purchasing scheme and a chain of in-house pharmacies.
The products sold through sick fund pharmacies have traditionally been the lowest prices in the market.

While open tenders are published in the local press, government-owned companies often use selective bidding practices whereby only selected companies are invited to bid on the contract.
Participation at annual trade fairs can help to develop company and product exposure to this market segment.
Government Procurement Regulations Under the Public Procurement Law and Regulations enacted in 1993, governmentowned companies and entities are required to procure by tender.
"Industrial Cooperation" regulations contain an offset clause for tenders over $735,000 (US$500,000) for the purchase of local products or use of local content for at least 35% of the cost of the contract.
Procurement is administered by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
Although Israel is a signatory to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Government Procurement Code, the "Buy Israel" regulation awards a 15% advantage to local companies.
As well, the National Priority Zones Regulations award an additional 5-15% advantage to companies located in the national priority areas.
MARKET LOGISTICS Tel Aviv is Israel's commercial and financial centre.
Centrally located on the Mediterranean coast and having 25% of the population, it is where most companies are headquartered.
The two major seaports are Haifa in the north and Ashdod in the south, each having good transportation links to the rest of the country.
Channels of Distribution Good representation is the key to the Israeli market.
Prospective exporters are recommended to use the services of a local representative/distributor or local agent who has a thorough knowledge of the market and well connected with key players.
Governed by the Agencies Act of 1965, general common law principles of agency law apply to the termination or cancellation of agency agreements.
An agreement for representation should specify the duration of the contract, provisions for exclusivity, compensation, promotional input and dispute settlement mechanisms.
Exporters new to the Israeli market are advised to appoint a local agent with an understanding of the local market; contacts with the Ministry of Health, the sick funds and other major players; and the ability to promote products effectively.
An importer of pharmaceutical products must have a licence and be a resident of Israel, or a representative of a corporation registered in Israel.
As a result, Canadian companies must either establish an office in Israel, or hire a distributor for their products.
For assistance locating an agent or distributor, contact the Canadian Embassy in Israel.
Suggested Business Practices The two official languages of Israel are Hebrew and Arabic, but English is widely spoken as the language of business and the one preferred for promotional materials.
Most signs in public places are in all three languages.
Yiddish, Russian, French and German are prominent among the languages used by immigrant groups.
The business environment is westernized but likely to be less formal in both dress (especially during the summer months), and the use of first names without titles.
Common office hours are from 8:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. Sunday to Thursday and from 8:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m. on Friday.
Israel has no formal constitution.
It has a modern, independent legal system based on a number of Basic Laws covering key areas of public life - such as the electoral system, the Knesset (parliament) and the legal system - as well as British case law, which effectively enforces property and contractual rights.
Moreover, Israeli civil procedures provide that judgments from foreign courts may be accepted and enforced by local courts.
The financial sector is modern and efficient with a full range of financial institutions and instruments.
There are few restrictions on foreign investment and investors and the regulatory environment and tax system favour foreign companies and investors.
The Consular Affairs Bureau of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) provides country-specific travel information reports and advisories.
Intellectual Property Protection Israel is a member of the World Intellectual Property Organization, the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, the Universal Copyright Convention and the Berne Copyright Convention.
As a member of the WTO, Israel is currently revising its laws to bring them into compliance with the Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIP) Agreement.
Patents Israeli patent laws protects both the process and the product and is granted for 20 years from the date of the application, subject to payment of renewal fees.
The owner of a patent must provide a local address when applying for a patent and the title must appear in both Hebrew and English (specifications, however, may be in either English or Hebrew).
The "first to file" principal applies, whereby the first or prior use of a patent does not protect the owner from infringement by someone else who applies first for a patent in Israel.
The use of the services of a patent attorney are recommended.
Generic Drugs Through 1998 and 1999, Israel amended its patent laws to permit domestic manufacturers of generic drugs to develop generic versions of patented drugs prior to the expiration of the 20-year patent protection for the innovator.
While the laws restrict production for use in research and for filing applications to regulatory authorities, it has no effective safeguards to restrict commercial exports.
The Israeli pharmaceutical market previously relied on licensed technology from foreign companies, or had to license their technology to large-scale manufacturers.
Israeli generic drug manufacturers have now become large enough to undertake the commercial development of pharmaceuticals.
These companies are opposed to any delay in research and development until after the full period of patent protection has expired.
The revised Israeli patent laws allow Israeli generic alternatives to be marketed as soon as the patent expires, when Israel's competitors would only be starting development of alternatives.
This gives Israeli companies a jump start on generic drug competitors, and would likely result in Israeli generic manufacturers gaining a larger portion of the market.
Fearing the erosion of their competitive advantage, the United States and the European Union oppose Israel's revised patent laws and are currently considering taking the matter to the WTO under the TRIP Agreement.
Furthermore, the European Union and the United States do not allow imports of generics while the patented drug is still protected and have threatened sanctions against Israel over Israel's interpretation of the TRIP Agreement.
This objection, however, will not prevent other nations from purchasing Israeli exports.
Canadian exporters are advised to follow this issue closely and take all necessary precautions to protect intellectual property.
Trademarks Applications for trademark protection may be made by the owner or their agent with written authorization from the owner.
All applicants must present a local address and pay the required fee of approximately $175.
The term of protection for a trademark is seven years but is renewable indefinitely for periods of 14 years upon payment of required fees.
Priority of registration is given to the first local user of the trademark and every application must specify goods or services falling within one class only.
Under the terms of the Paris Convention, where an application to register a trade or service mark in another signatory country has been made, the applicant has a right to claim priority for registration of the same trademark in Israel for the same use.
Import Regulations Free trade agreements have been signed with the European Union (1975), the United States (1985), the European Free Trade Alliance (1992) and Canada (1997).
Under these agreements, there are no custom duties on pharmaceutical imports.
Israel pursues a liberal import policy under which tariffs on products from most third-party countries were lowered to between 8% and 12% by 1998.
Most imports are free of licensing and quantitative restrictions.
All imports are subject to a 15% c.i.f. (cost/insurance/freight) value port fee, as well as a value-added tax (VAT) of 17%.
The VAT is recovered by the importer upon the resale of the goods and ultimately paid by the consumer in the final retail price.
The Ministry of Health imposes strict controls on the importation of pharmaceuticals.
Medical drugs and substances for their preparation may be imported only through a licence holder who is either an Israeli resident or a representative of a company registered in Israel.
To obtain a licence, a Registration of Medicinal Products must be submitted to the Ministry of Health.
As of 1998, there has been a concerted effort to speed up the approval process for drugs imported from the United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan and Australia.
Accordingly, drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and/or the European Medical Regulation Agency will be licensed by the Ministry within two months, rather than the usual 4-month period.
Regulations regarding the pricing of imported drugs were introduced in 1998 by the Minister of Health.
The previous regulations saw the importer use the price in the country of origin as a basis for the price in Israel.
Officials argued that this policy created artificially high prices by encouraging importers to purchase drugs from expensive sources.
The new regulation calls for prices to be set based on the lowestaverage price in Belgium, France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
Local Standards, Certificates or Registrations All imports into Israel must have a label indicating the country of origin, the name and address of the producer and the Israeli importer, the content, weight and volume.
In all instances Hebrew must be used.
English may be added provided the print is no larger than the Hebrew print.
In addition, specific labelling regulations may apply to various types of pharmaceuticals.
Exporters are advised to consult with the Israeli authorities or their local agent/importer to obtain specific requirements.
Export Credit Risks, Restrictions on Letters of Credit, Currency Controls The most common method of payment is through a letter of credit that guarantees payment.
Israeli importers prefer Cash Against Documents (CAD) and to collect an advance payment or an irrevocable bank guarantee on a portion of the shipment, given that there is no guarantee of payment with the CAD method.
The most common terms are 30, 60 and 90 days.

Readers should take note that the Government of Canada does not guarantee the accuracy of any of the information contained in this report, nor does it necessarily endorse the organizations listed herein.
This report is intended as a concise overview of the market for those interested in its potential and is not intended to provide in-depth analysis which may be required by the individual exporter.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Canadian agri-food exports to Israel in 2001 totalled $14.9 million(1).
The leading exports included lentils, non-alcoholic beverages, pet food, beans, sweet biscuits and peas.
Canada is Israel's top supplier of dried leguminous vegetables and is among the top three suppliers of soybeans and pet food.
The Israeli food market is moving toward a trend in convenience as evidenced by the many Israelis who are eating more prepared foods, fast foods and snacks.
Potential opportunities are available to exporters in several categories, including ready meals, savoury snacks, sauces and spreads.
The bakery, confectionery and pet food sectors are also promising markets for foreign goods.
Israel is already a major importer of Canadian grains, oilseeds and pulses with continued demand expected for the foreseeable future.
Canadian wines--particularly ice wines--are well-placed to develop a market share in Israel.
With the forecast growth of the private-label industry, significant opportunities also exist for Canadian manufacturers in nearly all product categories.
Israel's domestic food-processing sector is large, diverse and fairly modern by international standards.
Due to kosher requirements of the majority of the country's citizens, Israel has been forced to develop a relatively large food-processing sector.
Although non-kosher food products are produced and imported into Israel, together they account for less than 5% of the food market and their marketing channels are limited.
Exporters are therefore advised to export kosher products in order to achieve widespread distribution.
It is recommended that exporters consult with their Israeli importer prior to shipping.

MARKET OVERVIEW Israel offers a sophisticated and diversified marketplace for goods and services.
Despite its relatively small population of 6.3 million, Israel is still a country with a high volume of imports (both raw materials and finished goods).
Israel is experiencing an economic slowdown related to the Intifada, the world downturn and the high-tech slump.
Most sectors remain far below the peaks of 2000 and only weak recovery, at best, is forecast for this year.
The security situation has seen its greatest impact on traditional sectors such as tourism, construction and agriculture.
More significant overall has been the international economic slowdown, particularly given its impact on Israel's important high-tech sector and technology exports, on which a considerable part of Israel's economic boom had rested.
Nonetheless, Israel's new economy has shown remarkable resilience in the face of severe strain.
There is a sense among analysts and the business community that the business cycle will eventually turn around.
The United States accounts for approximately 30% of agri-food imports.
In 2001, Canadian agri-food exports to Israel totalled $14.9 million.
The leading exports included lentils (19.8%), non-alcoholic beverages (11.7%), pet food (9.6%), beans (7.8%), sweet biscuits (6.2%) and peas (5.3%).
By mid 2002, chickpeas were the top export followed by beans, peas, pet food, prepared fruit jams and lentils.
Kosher Kosher, which means right or clean, describes foods and practices that are specifically permitted by Jewish dietary laws.
With over 60% of the country's five million Jewish population maintaining some degree of kosher observance and a Moslem population of one million purchasing kosher food that meets the halal dietary requirement, Israel is the largest market in the world for kosher food.
Non-kosher food products, including locally produced and imported products, account for less than 5% of the food market and have limited marketing channels.
Although the import of non-kosher food is not forbidden (except for specific restrictions concerning meat and poultry products), its marketing in Israel is difficult.
Approximately half of the Jewish population consumes only kosher foods and most of this group does not shop in stores selling non-kosher products.
Therefore, the large consumer chains and many stores do not carry non-kosher goods.
The large food-processing plants also forgo the use of non-kosher raw materials in order not to lose this market segment.
The Israeli government monitors compliance with labelling requirements through the Ministry of Health(2).
Labelling of a foodstuff as kosher requires the certification of a Rabbi.
By law, the Chief Rabbinate is responsible for kosher certification, although it can delegate its authority to others.
Hence, goods can receive kosher certifications from rabbis in Canada but only with the concurrence of the Chief Rabbinate.
(See Key Contacts and Support Services for a list of kashrut(3) authorities in Canada.)
Rabbinical leaders of the ultra-orthodox sector contend that kosher certifications of the Israeli Chief Rabbinate do not meet the kashrut demands of their communities.
For maximum market coverage to the orthodox and/or ultra-orthodox market segments, products need additional certifications by some or all of the four main religious groups.
Foodstuffs may carry special orthodox/ultra-orthodox certifications to facilitate penetration of additional markets.
Exporters who wish to maximize their markets should comply with at least the Chief Rabbinate requirements.
Many food manufacturers in Israel display at least two kosher certification labels on their goods: the Chief Rabbinate plus an individual approval by one of the orthodox or ultra-orthodox sects.
Key Factors Shaping Market Growth Although Israel's food sector tends to be less sensitive to the overall economy than other sectors, food retailers have noted that consumers have become price sensitive and have reduced their purchases of luxury or high-priced items.
Hostilities in the region have also resulted in a significant decline in the number of people patronizing supermarkets.
According to a study carried out by an Israeli news station in July 2001, consumers are visiting shopping centres only half as much as they were in 2000.
Shoppers fear being caught in terrorist attacks, which often focus on shopping centres and other public spaces.
Food exports fell 4.2% in 2001 to $425 million compared with the previous year.
Elite Industries Ltd., for instance, has reported a 5% drop in sales of impulse products such as salty snack food and chocolate in the fourth quarter of 2001.
Decreases in sales, the company maintains, came as a result of the decline in tourism, pedestrian traffic and visits to entertainment complexes.
Economic slowdown due to Israel's security situation has not greatly affected the market for foreign products, however.
In fact, imports actually grew by 3.5% in 2001, totalling $870 million.
Israel's Manufacturers Association's Food Division have called on the government and consumers to buy locally made food products especially during these reversionary times.
Opportunities There are promising opportunities for Canadian exports in several food categories.
Strong growth in this sector is largely attributed to an increase of in-store bakeries and patisseries in supermarkets, which reflect the growing trend in Israel to buy rather than bake.
Sales of bakery products are expected to reach $2 billion or 4.4 million tonnes by 2005.
The most popular bakery products include fresh bread, which accounts for approximately 50% of in-store bakery sales, sweet biscuits, cakes, savoury baked items (e.g. filled filo-pastries and layered pastry leaves, such as jakhnun and malawah) and pizza.
Roldin, Israel's largest manufacturer of baked products, produces 300 different products, including cakes, breads, cookies and special products.
Elite Industries Ltd. is also a major supplier of wafers, cookies and cakes.
Many bakery items that are Western staples, including English muffins, some varieties of cakes, North American-style bagels and croissants have not been well-received in the Israeli food market.
Items such as pizza and frozen and chilled dough, however, are in high demand.
Opportunities for unique varieties of sweet biscuits and crackers are also available, although competition from local and European producers is fierce.
Sales of frozen bakery products are expected to grow steadily until at least 2005, reaching sales of $17.9 million.
Canadian exports of bakery items totalled almost $1 million in 2001.
Sales of sweet biscuits, which accounted for 6.2% of total Canadian exports last year, are expected to offer continued growth potential in the years to come.
Because the ingredients used in the production process of baked goods are so varied, exporters are advised to consult with Israeli importers to provide the specific guidance with regard to kosher certification for their products.
Additional certification may be required if eggs are present in the product.
Breakfast cereal is a category with tremendous growth potential.
Opportunities are available for unique and/or healthy varieties of breakfast cereal.
Although sales of private-label breakfast cereals have not been significant to date, demand is steadily increasing.
Private-label cereal is expected to be a huge market in years to come.
The United States, which supplies one third of the $18-million market, is Canada's main competitor in the market.
Pasta is among the fastest-growing items in terms of sales.
Israel's noodle and pasta market is currently estimated at $53 million annually with a estimated value of $57 million by 2005.
Exports of uncooked pasta from Canada jumped from $57 963 in 2000 to $203 174 in 2001 and have the potential for continued growth as demand grows.
Confectionery Products Israel is a promising market for imported confectionery products.
Chocolate is the best-selling segment of the confectionery sector.
Approximately 1.2 million tonnes of chocolate was sold in 2001 with sales expected to reach 2 million tonnes by 2005.
Chewing gum and sugar confectionery products (other than chocolate) are expected to reach sales of 646 000 and 647 000 tonnes, respectively by 2005.
Chocolate confectionery is expecting sales of $234 million in 2005, while gum and sugar confectionery are expected to reach $117 million and $114 million, respectively.
Firms in the confectionery industry compete on the bases of brand name, product advertising and promotion, specialty products, quality and cost of production.
Because confectionery products are usually discretionary and high-impulse purchases, promotion plays a substantial role in establishing brand-name presence foreign markets.
Most boxed or packaged chocolates are sold as gifts for special occasions.
With sales of $794 million in 2001, Elite Industries Ltd. is the domestic leader in Israel's chocolate and confectionery market.
Its confectionery product line includes chocolate bars, moulded and enrobed chocolate and chewing gum.
Carmit Candies, the Israeli distributor of Cadbury chocolates, is the country's leading manufacturer of marshmallows.
Although it has only a 4% share of the chocolate market, Carmit holds a 30% local market share of toffee candies, 21% of cookies, and 16% of halva.
Other major confectionery producers include A.K. International Age Marketing 1989 Ltd., Aharonoff Enterpresa Neve Zuf LTD., Allee Sweets (1990) Ltd., Friedland D. Ltd., Geva Food Products-Almond Tree, Mahroum Sweets Ltd., Rose of Galilee Candy & Chocolate Industry Ltd., Vita Quality Food Ltd., and Sides Moshe & Son Ltd.
Major domestic producers of chewing gum include Tamar Food Industries Ltd. and Atlas Sweets Ltd.
In 1999, chewing gum exports from Canada to Israel totalled $737 000.
Sugar confectionery exports, however, more than doubled in 2001 to $569 000, up from $226 000 in 2000.
Imports of chocolate confectionery products from Canada were negligible.
Israel's growing confectionery provides room for high-quality Canadian products.
Sugar-free and low-calorie confectionery products, in particular, are the fastest-growing market segments in this category.
Fish and Seafood In 2000, Israel's fish industry accounted for only 3.4% of the country's agricultural production.
The fish sector in Israel is limited to fresh-water fishing in the Sea of Galilee, salt-water fishing in the Mediterranean Sea and aquaculture facilities located in northern Israel.
Research is being conducted to determine if edible fish can be raised through thermal water sources in the south.
Future imports might decrease if this research proves successful.
In the mean time, the majority of fish and seafood consumed in Israel will be imported.
With sales of $16 million in 2000, canned tuna was the leading kosher fish product in the country.
Most tuna is imported but is packaged locally under the Bumblebee and Starkist brand names.
Imports of fresh lobster have been found recently in Israel's non-kosher market segment.
The best prospects for exporters include high-quality fish such as salmon and sole.
The United States, which accounted for 14% of country's $180-million fish imports in 2001, is Canada's main competitor in the market.
Canadian companies also face competition from Norway (salmon) and the Netherlands (herring).
Fresh or frozen fish is considered kosher if it has fins and scales.
Grains, Oilseeds and Pulses Israel relies on imports to meet 95% of its grains and oilseeds demand.
These thirsty crops are not commonly grown in Israel because of their heavy dependence on water.
Barley Barley is primarily used in Israel as a food supply for livestock.
It is also used as the basic ingredient for beer as well as an ingredient in soups and stews.
Local production of barley is concentrated in the Arab sector (mainly Bedouin in the Negev area) and to a lesser extent in the Jewish sector, where it is planted only for hay or silage.
In 2001, total domestic production amounted to 50 000 tonnes.
Due to the high price for barley, local production is expected to drop to 10 000 tonnes in 2002.
Imports of barley, most of which come from the Black Sea Basin (including Bulgaria and the Ukraine), showed a rising trend in the 1990s but dropped significantly in 2000 due to steep price increases.
Imports are forecast to rise again however in 2002 as local production is reduced.
The Canadian Wheat Board (CWB) holds a monopoly on Canadian malt barley sales to domestic and international customers.
Sales are made in two ways: the CWB works directly with customers to negotiate the purchase price and delivery conditions; and, secondly, accredited exporting companies purchase malt barley from the CWB for sales on their own accounts.
Exporters should note that most animal feeds and feedgrains do not require kosher certification.
Pulses Pulses, particularly chickpeas, dried beans and lentils, are an important part of the local diet.
Israel imported approximately 9000 tonnes of dry beans in 2001.
This figure is expected to grow at an annual average rate of 5.2% in 2002 and 2003; resulting in excellent opportunities for export sales of kidney beans, small white beans and great northern beans.
Israel's lentil imports have increased with an average annual growth rate of 8.82% over the last five years.
The country produces only 50 tonnes annually due to harsh climatic conditions.
Domestic demand and local production of chickpeas vary from year to year.
However, as a result of substantial investments, local production of chickpeas has been increasing steadily during the last 10 years, with an average growth rate of 13.7%.
Most chickpea suppliers to Israel are from the United States and the European Union.
However, new trade partners such as Turkey and countries from the former Soviet Union have also increased their share of the chickpea export market to Israel, through trimming costs due to proximity and cheap labour.
Israeli imports of dry peas will continue to be a strong market for Canada due to growing domestic consumption and the inability of local production to meet domestic demand.
Most Israeli pulse importers are small companies.
In many cases, importers are able to assume the responsibility of pulse distribution inside Israel.
Many of them are wholesalers and some of them have grocery outlets.
With sales of $5.1 million, pulses comprise the largest component of Canada's agri-food exports to Israel.
In 2001, lentils accounted for 19.8% of total exports.
Sales of beans (7.8%) and peas (5.3%) were also strong.
Canada is the top global supplier of lentils, peas and dried leguminous vegetables to the Israeli market and among the top four suppliers of chickpeas and beans.

More information about the CSCA and the services they provide can be obtained on their Web site at http://www.specialcrops.mb.ca.
Soybeans Due to water shortages, Israel's domestic oilseed production is limited to cottonseed, peanut and sunflower, which are grown mainly for feed or confectionery.
The country depends largely on imports of oilseeds for crushing.
In 2000, the United States accounted for 92% of soybean imports.
Water shortages may also result in the local industry foregoing production of sunflower seeds and peanuts in years to come, relying instead on imports for their needs.
Israel's annual crushing capacity of soybeans is approximately 625 tmt.
The largest soybean crusher in Israel is Shemen.
Other crushers include Teth-Beth, Olivex, Solbar and Milomor.
Domestic crushers are at a disadvantage because kosher restrictions allow them to operate only 250-270 days per year.
New crushing facilities in Turkey and Egypt are also posing a threat to domestic operations.
Although U.S. soybeans have a quality and supply advantage over many foreign suppliers, Israeli crushers are open to suppliers that can provide the same quality and reliability for service for a lower price.
Canadian exporters are therefore in a good position to compete.
Pet Food In Israel, approximately 21.5% of households have a dog, making them the most commonly owned pet in the country.
The number of dogs is also expected to rise in the coming years, increasing dog food sales.
Cats follow as the second-most popular house pet.
At present, approximately 12.2% of Israeli households having cats; this figure is expected to increase in the coming years as well.
Because of the unstable economy, sales of premium foods for dogs and cats will be low throughout the next few years, in favour of economy- and medium-priced foods.
Private-label pet foods, however, are expected to see significant growth.
Overall, wet dog food is expected to sell approximately $5 million in 2003, while dry dog food is expected to be worth $46 million.
Wet cat food is expected to sell $14 million and dry cat food is forecast to reach $18 million in 2003.
Sales of pet care products have been declining over the past few years from $11.3 million in 2000 to $10.6 million in 2001.
Forecasts estimate that sales in this sector will continue to decline for at least three years or until the economy becomes more stable and consumers are able to spend money on luxury items for their pets.
Sales of dog and cat food from Canada have almost doubled since 1998 reaching $1.4 million in 2001.
Canada is now the third-largest supplier to the Israeli market behind the United States ($9.1 million) and Italy ($1.8 million).
The market is poised for future growth and thus offers significant opportunities to Canadian companies.
Although non-kosher pet foods sell well in the market, kosher brands offer a distinct advantage and will likely provide a huge market in the future.
Prepared Foods/Packaged Foods Israeli consumers are looking for products that are quick and easy to prepare, and are spending more on food prepared away from home.
These changes in eating habits have encouraged supermarkets to allocate space for consumer-ready products, which consist of prepared meals and meal components.
Prepared foods also require certification--on a product by product basis, or at least on groups of raw materials.
According to the Kosher Meat and Poultry Imports Law, the meat or poultry component of prepared foods would have to come from an animal that had been slaughtered according to Rabbinate of Israel.
Exporters should consult with their potential importer or their agent in Israel prior to exporting.
Ready Meals Ready meals are aimed at consumers who work and do not have time to cook.
These meals are therefore convenient and easy to buy, transport, prepare and clean up.
Higher-earning professionals make up a large portion of ready-meal consumers.
Italian is the leading ethnic food in Israel as evidenced by the success of pasta-based ready meals and, most notably, pizza, which is the top-selling ready meal item in the country.
In 2000, frozen pizza accounted for 47% of volume sales and 44% of value sales in the ready meals category.
It is popular with all age groups and is purchased by families and singles.
Pizza, as well as poultry- and vegetable-based meals, sell for lower prices than red meat-, fish- and pasta-based ready meals because of the cost of their ingredients.
Although ready meals are available in several formats, chilled and frozen varieties are currently the best sellers and are poised for future growth.
Increased freezer space and the availability of new flavours have led to the growth of frozen ready meals.
Leading domestic producers of frozen ready meals include Soglowek Nahariya Ltd., Tivall, Tovav Ltd., Chiby Italian Food Ltd., Maadanot Ltd. and Hamsi Ltd.
Private-label ready meals have seen tremendous growth in recent years and accounted for 5.3% of total segment sales in 2000.
Nevertheless, sales of private-label ready meals are not slated for huge increases in the coming years due to the premium quality offered by their competitors.
There could be opportunities for high-quality, private-label ready meals, however.
The ready meals category is a relatively new area that has experienced strong growth in recent years due to busier consumer schedules.
As is the case with many new categories, currently there is a lack of brand loyalty, which will provide opportunities for high-quality products to distinguish themselves from existing brands.
Additional opportunities for Canadian suppliers may also be found in the sale of food ingredients used in the preparation of ready meals.
Condiments Israel's condiment market is valued at $210 million and is forecast to reach $225 million by 2005.
Ketchup has been the number one condiment since at least the mid-1990s and has retained the top spot since.
Tomato pastes, purees and sauces, salad dressings and mayonnaise offer consistent market growth, as do savoury sauces and dry mixes.
Osem, the leading domestic condiment producer, controls 50% of the market.
Other leading companies are Segal, Strauss and Vita.
Imported products account for 25% of the category and include popular brand names such as French's, Heinz, Hellmann's, La Choy and Paul Newman.
There is tremendous room for growth in this sector in a number of product categories, providing ample opportunities for Canadian exporters.
Ketchup is forecast to hold almost 25% of sales in 2003.
Tomato pastes and purees follow with a forecast of 17% while herbs and spices, as well as mayonnaise, are expected to represent almost 10% of sales.
Pickled products complete the top five condiments with almost 6% of sales.
Sales of Canadian condiments have fluctuated in recent years with exports of approximately $500 000 in 2001.
Snacks Annual consumption of savoury snacks in Israel is valued at $153 million.
Popular varieties include potato chips, wheat snacks, peanut snacks, and popcorn (particularly microwave popcorn), which have seen a 10-15% increase over the past few years.
Sales of snacks tend to increase by approximately 20-30% in the summer months.
Tremendous opportunities are available in the already booming savoury snack market.
Sales in 2002 are expected to reach $262 million, up from $256 million in 2001, and leap significantly to $278 million by 2005.
Israel's snack food industry is highly concentrated with two enterprises, Elite and Osem, dominating the market.
Nestlé, a majority owner of Israeli food producer Osem Investments, is scheduled to construct a research and development centre for snack foods in Sderot, Israel in 2002.
Spreads Although the spreads category makes up a small portion of Israel's total food and beverage sector, it has exhibited steady growth in recent years.
Chocolate spreads have seen the largest growth, from sales of $21 million in 1996 to $27 million in 2000.
It is the top overall product in the category, followed by honey and jams/preserves.
Demand for nut- and yeast-based spreads have also risen steadily in the past five years.
Continued growth in all categories is expected for at least the next four years with sales of $96.7 million forecast for 2005, up from $86.4 million in 2001.
Ingredients Opportunities for Canadian suppliers may also be found in the sale of food ingredients, since raw materials for Israel's food-processing sector are largely sourced through imports.
Agents actively seek out steady sources of supplies and are willing to pay higher prices for quality merchandise that is readily available.
Products including frozen fruits, ingredients for baked goods and ingredients for use in ready meals are in high demand.
Certain products that are sold in their natural state, such grains and oilseeds, can be certified as kosher even though they were not specifically produced as kosher product for Israel.
These products may require certification as to their kosher origin, but since the products do not go through a cooking process, the procedure is simpler than for prepared or processed products.
Nevertheless, exporters should check with their Israeli importer to ensure that all kosher requirements are met.
Private Label Private-label products represent an excellent opportunity for retailers to generate increased profits and distinguish themselves from competitors.
In 2001, private-label brands represented 7-9% of sales for the major supermarkets; this figure is expected to double in 2002.
With the growing demand for private-label goods in Israel, retailers are actively looking for new or unique products in nearly all product categories.
Super-Sol, Israel's leading supermarket chain, launched its private-label line, Super Class, in 2000 as a way to offer corporate branding to their products.
In 2001, the Blue Square supermarket chain entered into a partnership with Casino, the second-largest retailer in France, in an attempt to increase its market sales of private label from 4% to 10% of total store sales.
Under the agreement with Casino, Blue Square received a franchise for Casino's private-label line, Leader Price, which includes 2500 food and non-food products.
With its commitment to high quality and competitive pricing, the Canadian food industry is very well positioned to capture a larger share of this market.
The Clubmarket supermarket chain stocks President's Choice premium private-label products in addition to their own line, Cool.
Moreover, private-label lines offer important market access advantages, especially in markets so far away from home.
Categories with good prospects for Canadian companies include pet food, ready meals, confectionery and breakfast cereals.
Consumer patterns in the market are changing rapidly; annual per-capita consumption has increased over the past 10 years from 4 litres to 6.5 litres.
Approximately 79.4% of the adult Jewish population consumes wine.
Although most of the wine produced and consumed in Israel is kosher, the majority of imports are non-kosher wines.
For wine to be considered kosher it requires effort and commitment on the part of the wineries.
In general, only kosher vessels and materials may be used during the manufacturing process and the equipment and wine can only be handled by Observant Jewish males.
Importing wine to Israel is still sort of a niche activity, since the majority of supermarkets food chains and points-of-sale insist on the sale of kosher products only.
Nevertheless Canadian wines--particularly ice wines--are well-placed to develop a market share in Israel.
Additional opportunities can be found in sales of dry red wines, which are steadily reducing the dominance of white dry and semi-dry wines.
COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT Local Capabilities Agriculture represents 2.5% of Israel's total gross domestic product and 3.6% of exports.
Israel grows approximately 95% of its food requirements; the remaining 5% comes from imports.
Israel's major crops include wheat, corn, fruit (apples, apricots, citrus, cherries, kiwis, guavas, pears, bananas, dates, mangoes, grapes and tomatoes), vegetables (avocados, cucumbers, peppers and zucchini) and field crops (spices, medicinal plants and groundnuts).
Locally grown poultry and eggs meet Israeli demand; poultry accounts for two thirds of all meat consumed.
Approximately 80% of Israel's domestically produced agriculture goods come from two types of co-operative agriculture settlements: the kibbutz, a collective entity based on co-operative principles; and the moshav, a village of family businesses in which each household earns money from their own products but work as a collective co-operative when purchasing and marketing products.
Non-co-operative villages comprise the remaining 20% of domestic production.
This group is made up of the Jewish sector (non-agricultural rural villages) and the Arab sector, which grow vegetables. fruit, and olives, as well as raise sheep and goats.
Israel has a large and sophisticated food-processing industry that provides a broad array of food products.
There are almost 2000 business engaged in some from of food processing.
The leading manufacturers include Tnuva Food Industries, Elite Industries Ltd., Osem, Strauss Dairies, Israel Edible Products (TAMI), Tivall and the Meir Ezra Group.
Israel's domestic food industry has shown a decline in net profits since 1999.
Sales of food products slipped 41% from 1999 to 2000 due to a decrease in exports and the loss of 500 jobs.
Hostilities have also been a factor in the industry's decline.
From October 2000 to June 2001, sales of Israeli food products to the Palestinian Authority have dropped 50%, totalling a loss of $76 million for Israeli food producers.
International Competition Israel has a liberal import policy and has entered into free trade agreements (FTAs) with several countries: the United States, the European Union, the European Free Trade Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Turkey and Mexico.
Canada's main competitors in Israel are the European Union, which accounted for 39% of total food imports in 2001, and the United States (24.4%).
The United States has traditionally maintained a strong presence in the Israeli agri-food market, having tariff advantages over some Canadian agri-food products.
Products recognized to be "American" do very well with consumers.
A number of multinational firms, including Nestlé (Osem-Nestlé), Unilever (Tami-Unilever), Pilsbury, Danone, Knorr, Heinz/Starkist, Proctor and Gamble, Del Monte, Cadbury Schweppes PLC, Yoplait, Coca Cola, PepsiCo and Best Foods, have successfully entered the market through licensing agreements or in partnership with local food producers.
Canadian Position Canadian agri-food products are well-positioned to thrive in the Israeli market.
A significant number of Canadian food manufacturers produce kosher food products including bakery products and ingredients, confectionery products, fish (especially salmon), soybean meal, honey, and packaged food products and meals.
Canadian food producers have also developed a reputation as dependable suppliers of private-label goods and have made significant inroads into the Israeli private-label market over the past few years.
Solid examples abound on the shelves of the Clubmarket, which sources a significant array of President's Choice (PC)-brand private-label products from Canada.
President's Choice brand pet food, for example, accounts for 8% of Israel's private-label sales and is leading PC-brand product line in the market.
Nevertheless trade between the two countries face a number of barriers in the form of quotas agreed upon in CIFTA.
However, these duty-free quotas have been set well above historical trade levels in the hopes of expanding agricultural trade, particularly in the areas of grains, oilseeds and pulses.
Competitive Advantage Through Canadian Government Policies and Initiatives Canada-Israel Industrial Research and Development Foundation Canada and Israel are involved in a joint venture to promote research and development in all sectors including agriculture.
The Canada-Israel Industrial Research and Development Foundation (CIIRDF) was established in 1993 to promote research and development co-operation between Canadian and Israeli firms.
The CIIRDF both promotes and provides grants for companies looking for joint ventures.
Export Development Canada Export Development Canada (EDC) offers export financing and insurance to Canadian exporters.
Additionally, insurance can be provided for larger transactions that are subject to the terms and conditions established by the buyer.
EDC prefers to work through letters of credit, bank credits or bank guarantees.
Approval for financing is considered on a case-by-case basis.
EDC has three facilities in Israel:
Bank Hapoalim ($15 million); Bank Leumi ($15 million); United Mizrachi Bank ($15 million).
Program for Export Market Development The Program for Export Market Development (PEMD) helps Canadian companies enter new markets by sharing the costs of activities that companies normally could not or would not undertake alone, thereby reducing risks involved in entering a foreign market.
The PEMD refundable contribution ranges from $5000 to a maximum of $50 000.
Preference is given to companies with fewer than 100 employees for a firm in the manufacturing sector and 50 in the service industry, or with annual sales between $250 000 and $10 million.
Other components of the program include international bid preparation (Capital Projects Bidding) and, for trade associations, developing international marketing activities for their membership.

MARKET LOGISTICS Israel's largest cities have well-developed transportation systems and are easily accessible from Israel's largest free ports:
Haifa and Ashdod on the Mediterranean Sea and Eilat, on the Red Sea (Gulf of Aqaba).
Eilat is home to the country's only free-trade zone.
All major ports offer good quality warehousing, including cold storage, but growing demand has rendered capacity problems.
Israel has 610 kilometres of standard gauge railway and 15 965 km of highways.
There are eight main airports located primarily in the largest cities.
Ben-Gurion International Airport is the largest.
Channels of Distribution With an estimated total value share of 67.6% by 2005, supermarkets, hypermarkets and co-operatives are expected to dominate Israel's retail food sector in the coming years.
The number of discount stores is expected to decline during this period and be replaced by outlets of leading supermarket and hypermarket chains.
Israel's leading supermarket chain is Super-Sol Ltd. which operates 143 stores throughout Israel.
The chain operates a variety of supermarket formats including Cosmos and Super-Sol, which are large urban supermarkets; Hyper-Netto, discount food stores; Seven Universe Club, club-member superstores; and Birkat Rachel, a discount chain of supermarkets specializing in kosher products for Israel's ultra-orthodox community.
SuperSol purchases most of its imports from Israeli importers but operates one central distribution centre from which they deliver products to various stores in the chain.
Super-Sol's major competitor is Blue Square Ltd., which operates 171 stores in Israel including 12 Mega hypermarket outlets.
Other retail formats run by the chain include Super Center, the company's discount supermarket chain; King Center, a smaller version of hard discount-format retail centres; SuperCenter City, neighbourhood stores based on the Super Center model, and Co-Op, medium-sized convenience stores (generally found in Tel Aviv).
Like Super-Sol's Birkat Rachel, Blue Square's Shefa Mehadrin chain also caters to Israel's ultra-orthodox population.
The chain purchases most of its imports from Israeli importers although some high-volume, high turnover items, which do not demand a long warehousing period, are imported directly.
With 160 stores, Clubmarket Ltd. is Israel's third-largest food chain.
Like its competitors, it operates several retail formats including Clubmarket, its flagship discount supermarket chain; Co-Op, a large chain of convenience stores; Hyperzol, chain of discount stores; Glatmarket, discount food stores targeted to ultra-orthodox consumers; Metro, mega-store specializing in discount wholesale trading; Rav Mecher discount retail stores; Jumbo, large hypermarkets, and Franchisees, a subchain of small neighborhood stores operated via franchisees.
On-line Sales In 2001, Blue Square launched its Blue Centre Home Buying Network, which allows customers to purchase food items via telephone, Internet or fax.
Clubmarket offers similar services to its customers.
These Web sites allow for 24-hour-a-day shopping and provides up-to-date information on all products available.
Clubmarket also produces a catalogue for shoppers who want to shop by telephone or fax.
Israel's main supermarket chains report increased on-line purchases in the past 12 months.
SuperSol's NetSal Online reported that on-line and telephone sales in 2002 for Passover grew 20-30% compared to the same period in 2001.
This is especially significant given that prices for food products sold over the Internet are priced higher than those purchased in shops.
It is believed that Internet-based sales have risen largely as a result of reluctance of people to shop in public places due to security concerns.
Importers, Agents and Distributors Good representation is the key to the Israeli market.
Prospective exporters are recommended to use the services of a local representative/distributor or local agent who has a thorough knowledge of the market and is well connected with key players.
For assistance in locating an agent or distributor, contact the Canadian Embassy in Israel.
Israel has a diverse import system, ranging from small, two to three person operations that contract out distribution to large companies that offer full marketing and logistic services.
Large international firms often use multiple importers for distribution, however.
A nationwide list of Israeli food importers is available from the Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce.
Market-entry Considerations Suggested Business Practices The Consular Affairs Bureau of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade's (DFAIT) provides country-specific travel information reports and advisories at www.voyage.gc.ca/destinations/menu_e.htm. Canadians travelling to Israel should pay particular attention to their security and follow news reports carefully, as the security situation can change rapidly.
When entering the Israeli market it is advisable to appoint a local agent who understands the local market.
There is an unspoken understanding and trust within Israel's business community that welcomes partners and sales, but looks for a local who "knows you."
Israeli consumers tend to focus on price, quality and brand recognition.
Israelis expect service; a product without service is a product without real potential.
Israel's two official languages are Hebrew and Arabic.
However, English is readily used, especially by the business community, and an increasing number of Israelis speak or read French.
Many other languages are also spoken.
On Saturday (Sabbath), businesses including most restaurants are closed.
However, Sunday is a regular work day.
Government offices and most companies are closed on Fridays.
Import Regulations The Canada-Israel Free Trade Agreement was implemented on January 1, 1997.
The agreement improves market access for agri-food products of export interest to both Canada and Israel and eliminates virtually all tariffs on industrial goods.
It has partially restored Canada's competitive position in the Israeli market, where the United States and European Union have gained preferential access through negotiated bilateral agreements.
Canadian exports have increased by 30% since the CIFTA came into effect.
Canada and Israel are currently re-negotiating the CIFTA and Canada hopes to further liberalize trade in agri-food products.
Not only will this maintain Canadian exporter's competitive position vis-à-vis exports from other countries, it will help to secure long-term opportunities for Canadian agri-food products.
Canada and Israel agreed that the next round of negotiations would exclude the mutually sensitive supply managed sectors of dairy, eggs and poultry.
Through the CIFTA, duty-free access or low rates of duty for specific Canadian agri-food items have been made available:
• under the agreement, Israel has established annual duty-free tariff rate quotas of 200 000 tonnes of coarse grains (rye, barley, oats and corn) from Canada.
Canadian malt exports also benefit from duty-free tariff rate quotas with annual quotas set at 9000 tonnes;
•  Canadian producers of confectionery products, peanut butter, jams, fruit jellies, and sauces will also find duty-free access to the Israeli market;
•  pulse crops benefit from a duty-free tariff rate quota of 10 000 tonnes; and
• Canada also benefits from a preferential tariff-rate of 14% for frozen raspberries, blueberries and selected specialty berries.
For more information on the CIFTA, visit Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Web site at http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca/ tna-nac/cifta-e.asp. With the exception of fresh fruits and vegetables, all imported products are subject to a value added tax of 17%, which is levied on the cost, insurance and freight, landed cost plus purchase tax.
Documentation Standard documentation includes a certificate of origin, a commercial invoice, a bill of lading and a kosher certificate.
Commercial invoices must contain the following information: names and address of supplier, seller and buyer; shipping information; detailed description of goods; quantity or measure (in metric units); price or value of each unit; total gross and net weights of each package; total gross and net weights of shipment; price per unit; terms of supply; rate of exchange; statement of all charges involved; total value of shipment; HS tariff number heading; country of origin; name of Israeli agent (if applicable); Israel import licence (if applicable); and signature of the manufacturer, consignor, owner or duty authorized agent.
With regard to health/phytosanitary certification, the Government of Israel requires that food and health products be registered with the Ministry of Health before they can be sold in the country.
Sanitary regulations are governed by mutual agreements under membership in the World Trade Organization.
Documents that need to be authenticated, such as certificates of sale and letters authorizing an exporter's local agent or importer to act on their behalf, must first be notarized in Canada.
At no cost to the exporter, the notarized documents can be authenticated by sending them to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade's Authentication and Service of Documents (JLAC) branch.
Although import licences have been removed, imported food items still require the approval of the Ministry of Health's Food Inspection Service before entering the country.
This agency is also responsible for labelling and packaging requirements.
All plant material requires approval from the Plant Protection and Inspection Agency.
Fish imports must be accompanied by a Certificate of Origin and Hygiene.
Additional information on Canadian exports of fish to Israel can be obtained from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/fispoi/ export/cert10/isrisre.shtml). For statistical purposes, Canada requires exporters to complete an Export Declaration (Form B13A).
The following information is required on all consumer packaging entering Israel: country of origin; name and address of the producer; name and address of the Israeli importer; contents; and weight or volume in metric units.
In all instances, Hebrew must be used.
English lettering on the label may also be provided, but the English letters cannot be larger than the Hebrew letters.
Moreover, the English lettering must be identical in content to the Hebrew wording.
In the labelling, packaging and advertising of a food, section B.01.049 of the Food and Drug Regulations prohibits the use of the word kosher or any letter of the Hebrew alphabet, or any other word, expression, depiction, sign, symbol, mark, device or other representation that indicates or that is likely to create an impression that the food is kosher, if the food does not meet the requirements of the Kashrut applicable to it.
For more information, consult the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's Web site at http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/bureau/labeti/guide/ 4-0-1be.shtml#4-2-16. All manufactured and processed foods must be labelled with nutritional information according to guidelines set by the Israeli health ministry.
Unprocessed fish is exempt from this requirement.
Exporters should consult with their importers for further details concerning Israeli labelling requirements.
The Israeli government has not yet issued a policy on genetically modified organisms.
However regulations are being prepared which will require positive labelling for genetically modified products or an ingredients.
To avoid infractions, exporters are strongly advised to consult with an Israeli authority to ensure all labelling and packaging requirements are met.
Specific information on labelling and packaging standards is available from the Israeli Ministry of Health, Food Control Services.
Local Standards, Certificates or Registrations Imported food products are subject to standards issued by the Standards Institution of Israel (SII) and the Ministry of Health's Food Control Services.
These standards include those for packaging and labelling of food products as well as technical specifications with respect to chemical and physical attributes.
The SII adheres to international standards established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
The SII is also the authority that determines wine standards in Israel.
The Wine Institute is in charge of their implementation and is therefore the only body in Israel legally responsible for the safe consumption by the general public of all alcoholic beverages, whether domestic or imported.
It is important to note that the Wine Institute is not considered an authority on the quality of the wine itself and is only judging whether the wine adheres to Israeli standards.
Export Credit Risks, Restrictions on Letters of Credit, Currency Controls Despite the security situation and political upheavals, conditions for financing in Israel remain favourable.
Payment is usually done through a letter of credit.
Credit terms last 60-90 days.
In cases where distribution arrangements are concluded, exporters are advised to prepare a contract detailing all major points of agreement, rights and responsibilities.
Local currency delays are, on average, one month.
Although local currency payments are generally made by importers within two weeks, foreign exchange delays of two months are currently reported.
The import cover is currently 5.8 months.

History  British Columbia Records indicate that early plantings of tree fruits in British Columbia followed in the wake of movement of settlers into the interior.
The earliest tree fruits are said to have been grown from seed brought to Fort Vancouver in 1826.
Scions or seedlings of tree fruits, supposedly taken from these early plantings, were then established for local use wherever settlements occurred.
By the 1850's, there were plantings of small orchards in the Lower Fraser Valley, and the first commercial orchard was said to have been established at Lytton, further north between 1870 and 1875 by Thomas G. Earl.
However, due mainly to cold winters, this area did not prove itself to be a particularly favourable region for orcharding.
In the meantime, an orchard established in 1867 in the Similkameen Valley by F.X. Richter did do well and from this beginning, the industry flourished.
The Okanagan, as well, was discovered to have a climate favourable to tree fruit production.
The first apple trees in the Okanagan Valley were plants by an oblate missionary, Father Pandosy, in 1862, on the present location of the City of Kelowna.
They were supposed to have orginated directly from trees planted at the Oblate Mission at Mission, B.C. When this first tree was planted, the area was semi-arid with insufficient rainfall to grow anything but sagebrush and rattlesnakes.
With the discovery that tree fruits did well in the hot dry climate of the Okanagan-Similkameen Valleys, fruit orchards sprang up throughout the area.
Obviously, many of these orchards did not survive due to unsuitable climate and/or soil conditions.
But with the introduction of power pumps and open flumes, which could be used to direct water from lakes and rushing creeks in the foothills, orchards were planted inland along the length of the Okanagan-Similkameen and Kootenay Valleys.
Now, 120 years later, with all of the modern methods for moving water not only inland but also to higher elevations, the slopes bordering these valleys have been planted to orchards and vineyards, and they now represent a veritable paradise on earth.
Ontario Fruit growing in Ontario probably commenced with the culture of cherries and peaches in the Niagara Peninsula.
Records indicate that these two fruits were being harvested at the mouth of the Niagara River as early as 1790.
Early mentions of apple propagation in the area come to us from the diary of Charles Woolverton of Grimsby Township.
He mentions that the sale of 200 acres of land to his grandfather, John Woolverton in 1796, was bound by the inclusion of 5 natural apple trees.
The first McIntosh tree was discovered in 1811 at Dundela, Dundas County, Ontario by John McIntosh, the son of Scottish immigrants to the United States.
He immigrated to Canada in 1796 from New York State, and eventually settled on a farm near Ottawa.
He discovered an overgrown orchard on this property and transplanted twenty of the healthiest seedlings to new ground, but only one survived.
This tree produced apples that all his neighbours commented on.
True to his Scottish origins, McIntosh tried to capitalize on his new find but it wasn't until 1835 when a peddler showed McIntosh techniques of bench grafting, that he succeeded in duplicating the famous McIntosh tree.
However, the McIntosh was slow to gain acceptance by growers probably due to its susceptibility to scab.
By 1900 with the new spray techniques becoming available to growers, McIntosh rapidly became an important variety.
Today, McIntosh are cultivated in nearly every apple growing area of North America.
Quebec Even before 1850 there were established orchards in several areas of Québec.
Most of the trees were seedlings grown from seeds supplied by such countries as United States, France, England and Russia, and a majority of these early orchards were located on the slopes of the mountainous region surrounding Farnham and Abbotsford.
Other important areas were located south of Montréal in Chateauguay County as well as west of Montréal in Deux Montagnes.
Other fruit growing areas found in the Isle of Orléans near Québec City and in L' Islet County further north, date back to the days of France's presence in Québec.
In 1875, 25,000 bushels of apples were harvested in Québec.
Of this crop a large percentage was marketed in Montréal.
M.B. Southwick of St. Hilaire reported 20,400 apple trees in that area in 1876.
An equivalent number was reported in the Abbotsford region.
Much of the harvest was marketed in populated centres on the shores of the St. Lawrence.
Today that same marketing pattern exists with a large majority of the Québec crop moving to major urban centres such as Montréal and Québec City which border the St. Lawrence River.
New Brunswick Fruit cultivation was probably introduced to New Brunswick in the 17th century by early settlers from France who came out to settle Acadia.
Nicholas Denys was one of these.
He and his wife came to the New World to manage a string of fur-trading posts in Northern Acadia.
Denys was also expected to bring out colonists.
Unfortunately, he had difficulties doing this and as a result, he was dispossessed and lost most of his belongings.
He finally retired with his wife and family to a small farm which he owned near Nipisiquit, New Brunswick.
Here, he kept a garden with fruit trees in it.
He left journals and information on fruit propagation in the area which provided important information for others in the fruit industry to build on.
New York State still supplied apples to Fredericton as late as 1856.
However, the greatest advances in fruit cultivation in the province after this date must be attributed to Frances Peabody Sharp of Upper Woodstock.
By 1891, he was reported to be growing 900,000 apple trees and 60,000 plum trees, and was shipping nursery stock all over the continent.
Sharpe was also very interested in apple breeding and developed two varieties, the New Brunswick Apple and Crimson Beauty, which apparently had the Fameuse and the New Brunswick Apple as its parents.
Today, the Crimson Beauty is still grown in many Canadian orchards and stands as a monument to one of Canada's early horticulturists.
Nova Scotia As with the development of fruit culture in other parts of Eastern Canada, fruit growing no doubt was introduced to the area by early settlers and was necessitated by the need for self-sufficiency.
That would date the beginning of fruit propagation in Nova Scotia to the early 1600's.
As with Québec, fruit growing was a family affair with each homestead having several apple trees.
In 1862, displays of Nova Scotia fruit at a London, England exhibition were widely acclaimed by all who saw them.
By 1939, Nova Scotia was exporting 75% of its production to the British markets.
However, from 1939 to 1965, the industry exports to U.K. went into a decline.
Three things possibly caused this.
As was the case during World War I, little fruit was exported to the U.K. during the second World War.
By the time the war was over, fruit production and specifically apple production in England and Europe had reached significant proportions.
Coupled with this was the shortage of exchange.
The organization of the European Economic Community, and Britain's entry into it, did little to improve the status of Nova Scotia in a traditional market.
The introduction of several processing facilities which take a large percentage of the crop has somewhat served to temper the blow that the industry suffered in losing this market, and together with added interest in the potential of apples for processing, has served as an incentive for increasing interest in fruit production in the province.
Welcome to Canadian Apple Online, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's site for Canadian apple market information Agri-Food Trade Service Online provides access to international trade and market information for Canadian agri-food exporters.
Canadian Apple Online will be helpful to a large base community to better understand the dynamics of the apple industry in Canada.
On this site, you will find basic information on production, trade, regulation and even nutrition.
More detailed information could be accessed through other links.
From this site, you can also access a series of contacts from governments, industry and the main national and regional associations.

Production  Canadian Fruit Situation The summer of 2002 was characterized as being generally dry in nearly all regions of the country.
These conditions had the effect of reducing production of most fruit crops including apples, tender fruits, raspberries and strawberries.
The resulting lower production also negatively affected farm gate values.
In 2002, the value of all Canadian fruit, including apples, tree fruit and berries, amounted to $517.1 million, a small decrease of less than 1% from 2001.
Within the overall fruit category, the berry sector accounted for the largest percentage of value with 54.5%, followed by apples with 31.2%, and tree fruits with 14.1%.
The area of production of berry and tree fruits changed (Table 1) over the past twenty years with the help of new technology and pruning practices that have allowed producers to increase tree densities, yields and therefore production.
Over the last five years, the number of tree fruit farms have decreased by 28%, after being relatively stable fifteen years before.
On the other hand, the number of berry farms have slightly decreased, but by only 2% the last five years.
The important changes were in acreage.
Berry farms increased their acreage by more than 20% the last five years and more than doubled the last twenty years.
The berry category (blueberries and cranberries) have witnessed increased production in response to positive health claims, but prices have weakened in the past few years due to oversupply situations and weaker export opportunities.
Grape area continues to expand and has increased over 40% in the last five years, driven primarily by the demand for high quality Vinifera grapes for wine production.
In the 2001 Statistics Canada Census, from 1996 to 2001, number of acreage devoted to apple production decreased by 18% mainly due to low commodity prices and retail consolidation, and in spite of new production practices and better yield per hectare.
Producers are struggling to receive a fair return of their crop.
Being at the end of the supply chain, producers want to remain competitive and achieve the goals of environmentally responsible production of safe, high quality food for domestic and exports markets.
Table 1 - Number of Farms and Hectares (Tree Fruits and Berries) by major provinces PROVI NCES 1981 1986 1991 1996 2001 2001/ 19961
Statistics Canada (1981 to 2001 Census) 1 % Change from 2001 to 1996
Apples The 2002 Canadian apple crop is estimated at 412,161 metric tonnes (MT) representing a 15% drop from 2001 (482,484 MT) and the fourth consecutive decrease since 1999 (see Table 2).
The provinces of Ontario and Quebec suffered huge loss with record-low production over the last five years.
Climate conditions and severe competition form other countries are responsible for those decreases.
The farm gate value of Canadian apples from the 2002 crop are estimated at $166 million, nearly the same as in 2001 ($166.3 million) and almost as low as the 1998 crop ($160 million).
On a provincial basis, production in British Columbia decreased slightly by 2% from a year earlier to reach 126,600 MT, and remained relatively stable at that level since the 1998 crop.
McIntosh, Spartan, Red Delicious, IdaRed and Empire are the major varieties produced mostly in Eastern Canada.
British Columbia growers have planted a number of newer apple varieties such as Gala, Fuji, Braeburn, Jonagold, Ambrosia and Honeycrisp.
In fact, Gala should become the most important variety in BC, before Red Delicious.
New plantings of Ambrosia are doubling in size every year and should remain likewise for the next 3-4 years.
In response to rising availability, grower prices for these newer varieties has moderated significantly in the past couple of years.
In addition, apples continue to compete for limited retail shelf space with other major fruit such as bananas and citrus, but also more increasingly from exotic fruits from around the world which are now available on a year-round basis.
Apple juice concentrates from China were imported at a very low price and affected greatly local industry and growers.
Producers had to find alternate options to process their apples.
Ontario had to increase the number bulk loads of apples from Maritime provinces.
Ambrosia is also popular in Ontario and plantings are expected to increase.
New-Brunswick and Nova Scotia recorded major increase in production, improving their trade with central provinces.
Statistics Canada * Estimate 1 % Change from 2002 to 2001
1.1 Cost of production As the Canadian Apple industry is a major component of the horticulture industry, many producers are afflicted with low returns on investment, even below their costs of production.
Producers claim to loose 22.85 cents per kg (9.25 cents per pound) on average, surviving mostly on depreciation and equity of their assets.
Replant costs are estimated $30,000 to $37,000 per hectare ($12,000 to $15,000 per acre) and full production capacity is not reached until 4 to 6 years following replant.
There is also support from Farm Credit Canada with their program "Plant Now - Pay Later" allowing up to three years of interest deferral.
1.2 Storage Holdings & Utilization With respect to the 2002 crop, total storage holdings as of November 01, 2002 (the first storage release date of the new crop year) were 201,199 MT, a 5.5% decrease from the 213,013 MT in storage the previous year at the same time.
Only the province of Quebec recorded an increase while other major provinces recorded decreases varying from 2% to 27% (see Table 3).

1.3 Standard Practices 1.3.1 Integrated Fruit Production In March 2002, the Canadian Horticultural Council received approval for up to $151,500 in CARD funding on December 19, 2001 from the Canadian Adaptation and Rural Development (CARD) fund for "The Canadian Apple Industry National Integrated Fruit Production (IFP) Initiative".
IFP is defined as the economical production of high quality fruit which gives priority to ecologically sound methods, and minimizes the use of agricultural chemicals, thereby protecting the environment and human health.
The project is designed to develop national IFP guidelines, principles and standards for the Canadian apple industry.
More information is available on the CHC website at (http://www.hortcouncil.ca/). The CHC's Apple Working Group (AWG) will move into the next phase of the initiative and works towards deelopment of national on-farm food safety guidelines for Canadian apple growers.
1.3.2 Integrated Pest Management The apple industry, in cooperation with Provincial extension specialists and officials at the Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA), have developed an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy.
IPM is a process that optimizes the use of biological, cultural and chemical measures to control pest and disease pressures.
Producers continue to adapt their agricultural management practices to respond to environmental concerns, reduce costs of crop protection materials and address pest/disease resistance concerns.
The framework for the program has also been designed to be transferable to other tree fruit crops.
IPM is part of the IFP strategy.
1.3.3 Pest Management Regulatory Agency - Update Update on Streptomycin and 1-MCP Apple growers' concerns in relation to product availability in the short term include the antimicrobial Streptomycin, and a growth regulator type of product recently registered in the U.S., 1-MCP (1-methylcyclopropene).
The bacterial disease fire blight can affect several types of fruit trees including apple and pear.
Under favourable conditions and without adequate control, a fire blight infection can have a serious impact in an orchard.
One of the few tools available to apple growers for managing this problem is the antibacterial Streptomycin.
The issue of antibiotic resistance in general, and the fact that resistance problems have been observed in some orchards have been making the future of this product uncertain.
However, growers are not ready to give up on the use of this product since no other alternatives have been found yet to fill the niche of an efficient antibacterial product for orchard use.
Registration of this product has been renewed for the 2003 season.
When harvested fruits are exposed to the volatile active ingredient 1-MCP, they are less susceptible to the influence of the gaseous plant hormone ethylene, which is involved in the ripening of fruit.
Ethylene is particularly important in stored apples and that is why apple growers see the new product as having good potential to improve the quality of their produce and to extend apple storage time.
They are eager to obtain early registration of this product since their US counterparts already have the benefit of using 1-MCP since last year.
The product 1-MCP has entered the submission process at the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, following a recent application for registration in Canada.
1.3.4 Traceability (www.producesupply.com) Traceability addresses how a product can be traced through the supply chain.
CPMA and PMA created in November 2002 a joint task force to tackle traceability (CPMA/PMA Traceability Task Force).
This group is to produce a "best practices" document that will serve as a road map for the industry for implementing traceability.
More information on EAN available at: http://www.ean-int.org/index800.html. 1.3.5 Canadian Partner-in-Quality A Quality Management program based on HACCP principles, the Canadian Partners in Quality (C-PIQ) program, is being developed as a voluntary alternative to traditional inspection methods for fresh fruit and vegetables.
Under the C-PIQ program, the facility would assume responsibility for documenting and implementing a Quality System to ensure that produce quality requirements are met.
The program will be validated through periodic audits of each facility's system by CFIA auditors.
The initial C-PIQ pilot project, in 2002, in potato packing facilities in the Atlantic went well.
CFIA have had discussions with the industry on fees and presented the program to the USDA last summer.
USDA visited the pilot participants and CFIA is awaiting USDA acceptance of the program.
1.3.6 Code of Practice for unpasteurized fruit juice A voluntary "Code of Practice" for the manufacture of unpasteurized fruit juice/cider, developed by the CFIA in partnership with Health Canada, producer, processor, distributor and consumer representatives was finalized and distributed in 1998.
The Code sets out recommendations for growing, harvesting, transporting, storing, processing, packaging, and distributing the product.
Its objective is to make all producers aware of the potential problem and inform them of how to avoid the contamination of their juice/cider by pathogenic microorganisms, such as E. coli 0157:H7.
1.3.7 Global Coding To ensure consistency of codes around the world, industry worked with the International Federation for Produce Coding (IFPC) to introduce a global standard for the use of international Price Look-Up (PLU) numbers.
Those numbers are available free on the internet at: www.plucodes.com. 1.3.8 Data Pools The emergence of data pools in the industry is present in Canada (ECCnet) and the United States (UCCnet).
Launched in 2000 by the Electronic Commerce Council of Canada (ECCC), ECCnet is designed to centralize data to ensure greater accuracy and also provide cost-savings to trading partners.
The Canadian produce industry has come up with its own Industry Product Database (IPD), the purpose of which is the same as EECnet, but structured to meet the specific requirements of produce.
The industry is now trying to determine which system is going to provide the best solution, the best data and the easiest to manage.
1.3.9 Repacking, Transportation and Wholesale Food Safety Project The first edition of these "best practices" guidelines will be finalized in 2003 by CPMA.
Also CPMA will issue a HACCP model for the repacking and wholesale sector, including Critical Control Points.
The model may not apply to all as needs differ.
CPMA involved the Canadian Council of Grocery Distributor (CCGD) in developing and implementing a HACCP toolkit for the warehouse operations.
1.3.10 Promotion Canada's apple producers supported a national apple promotion in the past two years in conjunction with the Five to Ten A Day campaign.
In addition, a national apple website was initiated in the summer of 2000 and can be accessed at: http://ats-sea.agr.ca/applecanada/. The site includes such subjects as production areas, associations, suppliers, varieties and consumer information.
1.4 Trade As of January 1st, 2003, the Mexican government implemented the 2003 tariff elimination on agri-food products as scheduled under NAFTA.
Fresh apples, grape and apple juice have now duty free access in the Mexican market.
During the 2001-02 CY, Canadian imports (quantity) of fresh apples surpassed exports by 113%.
In the 1996-1997 CY, imports were almost the same volume as exports.
GRAPH -- Imports and Exports of Fresh Apples (quantity) GRAPH -- Imports and Exports of Fresh Apples (value) 1.4.1 Exports The volume of Canadian fresh apple exports for the first five months (August - December) of the 2002-03 crop year (CY) were up 12% to 35,306 MT as compared to 31,438 MT in the 2001-02 CY for the same period (Table 4).
The value of exports for the first five months of the 2002-03 CY increased 23% to $34.9 million from last year's period ($28.3 million).
For the first five months of 2002-03 CY, exports to the U.S. and Mexico were almost unchanged from last year's period.
Total Canadian apple exports were valued at $52.1 million for the 2001-02 CY, virtually the same as the previous CY and 22% below the record-high 1996-1997 season.
During the past ten crop years, 65% to 70% of all Canadian apple exports originated from British Columbia, while providing between 25% and 30% of total production.
Compared to domestic production, exports of apples represent approximately 10% to15% of total production.
Statistics Canada *August to December 2002 1 % Change from 2001-02 to 2000-2001 Canada has exported apples to over 20 countries (see Table 5) in the past few years with the most commonly exported varieties being Golden and Red Delicious and Gala.
The United States, Mexico and the United Kingdom remain in the top three, other countries in Asia-Pacific and the Caribbean have been moving in and out of the remaining spots.
Canada should gain market share in Mexico with the latest improvements in NAFTA.
In Europe, Canada exports mainly to the United Kingdom.
As for Asia, the value of Canadian exports has fluctuated widely in recent years due to the downturn of the Asian economy.
During the first five months of 2002-2003, exports to the Philippines and Indonesia appear to be declining compared to the previous year.
In the past few years, low priced Chinese apples have displaced Canadian apples from many Asia-Pacific markets.
Statistics Canada *August to December 2002 1 % Change from 2001-02 to 2000-2001 1.4.2 Imports The volume of Canadian fresh apple imports for the first five months (August - December) of the 2002-2003 crop year (CY) were up 39% at 41,368 MT as compared to 29,840 MT in the 2001-02 CY for the same period (Table 6).
However, the import value for the first five months of the 2002-03 CY increased by 54%, from $33.2 to $51.0 million.
Canada imports of fresh apples originated from about 15 countries, lead by the U.S., New Zealand, South Africa, Chile and Argentina (Table 7).
The following apple varieties accounted for most of Canadian imports:
Granny Smith, Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, and to a lesser extent Fuji, Gala, Braeburn and McIntosh.
The main time period for apple imports from Southern Hemisphere countries is April through August, with June having the largest number of imports.
1.4.3 Imports of Fresh Apples for Processing The total quantity of fresh apples imported for processing in 2001 amounted to 33,915 MT, a decrease of 15% from 2000.
The 2001 imports were valued at $38 million, down 15% from the previous year.
(A reminder that these statistics are based on calendar year and not crop year).

1.5 Other Markets 1.5.1 U.S. Apple Situation Utilized apple production for 2002 is estimated at 3,898 thousand MT (8.47 billion pounds), down 8 percent from the 2001 level, and down for the third consecutive year.
Decreased acreage was caused mainly by financial problems and fierce competition from foreign apple growers, namely China.
Washington's utilized production increased 5 percent compared to the weather reduced 2001 crop.
California, Michigan, New York, and Pennsylvania decreased total utilized production from the previous year due to poor weather and less bearing acreage.
Higher prices for apples and pears were mainly responsible for the 3-percent increase in the U.S. grower price index for fruit and nuts during the fall of 2002 compared with the previous year.
Weather problems such as freezing temperatures and hail reduced the harvest of apples and pears this past fall and together with lower stocks drove grower prices higher for these two commodities.
Fresh apple prices averaged 17 percent higher.
Aside from significant declines in production among eastern and central apple-producing States, a late October freeze in Washington, the Nation's largest producer of apples, has further reduced domestic supplies available for marketing into 2003, particularly of the Pink Lady and Fuji varieties.
Hence, apple prices are expected to remain strong and increase further through this winter, especially as supplies grow seasonally tighter.
As of December 1, 2002, fresh apple holdings in regular and controlled atmosphere storage facilities, as reported by the U.S. Apple Association, were down 2 percent from the same period the year before and are the lowest level in more than a decade.
National Agricultural Statistics Service, USDA f = forecast 1 % Change 2003 from 2002 1.5.2 U.S. Apple Trade Apples lead in U.S. fresh fruit exports, both in volume and value terms.
Each year the United States ships more than 500,000 MT (1.1 billion pounds) of apples to markets across the world, with an annual value of approximately over $360 million.
The quantity of fresh apples shipped between January and November 2002 declined 18 percent over the previous year along with its value, from $363.9 to $329.2 million.
1.5.3 World Market For the second consecutive year, China and the U.S., the two leading world apple producers, have witnessed decrease of apple acreage.
In China, government policy encouraged fruit growers to more fruit diversification, contributing to reducing the apple acreage.
In terms of the variety mix, there is indication that the importance of Red and Golden Delicious will slowly decrease at the expense of Gala and Fuji.
Market globalization and increasing competition require good knowledge of the competitive strengths and weaknesses of different producing countries.
It is also important to monitor trends in consumer preferences in order to plan a future strategy for production, distribution and marketing.
Newer varieties that entered the apple market in the 1990's have become so mainstream that their once attractive price premiums have leveled off.
The Canadian apple industry has been facing a number of challenges over the past decade or so, including a general decline in producer prices and an increase in North American and world production (see Table 9).
Canada must remain competitive in order to survive not only at home but also in foreign markets.
Apples are produced in all major parts of the world and retailers can supply from all those sources, as long as those apples meet certain requirements.
Many of those requirements are dictated by consumers and competition.
In Canada, consumers have a considerable advantage compared to others around the world as they spend less than 10% of their income on a food basket.
Competition is then fierce.
Canadian producers must then differentiate from other suppliers with unique advantages.
Canada produces approximately 500,000 MT of apples each year, or less than 1% of the world production estimated at 59,000,000 MT in 2001 (Table 9A).
Two regions, Asia and the European Union are the main producers (Table 9B).
China's apple production increased by five-fold in the last decade alone to more than 20 million MT.
Varieties of apples have also changed since the early 1990's.
This increase was at the expense of varieties such as Red and Golden Delicious, Rome and McIntosh, that are predominant in Canada.
Production is expected to rise by 21% in the world, mostly because of China, until 2010.
Canada has increased its imports of apple juice concentrate from China and fresh apple imports from countries such as New Zealand, South Africa and Chile.
FAO Statistics 1 United States and Canada only 2 Consult FAO definitions * % change 2001 over 2000 The sector is in the process of addressing issues such as market development, research and reduced pesticide usage, all of which will benefit producers.
As an example, tariffs for the European Community (EC) are very complex, changing every month during the European Union (EU) crop season and differing for each apple variety.
Under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), TRQ and tariffs for apples for Mexico were eliminated in January 2003.
Tariffs in Argentina are 13% and Venezuela 15%.
In addition to these tariffs, there can be consumer and other taxes which vary from 3% to 15%.
In Asia, there are tariffs of 50% in Taiwan, 10% in Thailand and 5% in Indonesia.
Japan still requires apple exports to be fumigated and an inspector to be on site during the fumigation.
1.6 Challenges Producers will face major challenges in the next decade and these originate from the consumers themselves, social pressures and the retailers.
Consumption of apples was a family thing, with the typical father-mother-two-kids model.
Things have moved from a more single parent and single-person model.
Consumers are also more educated and conscious of their environment and the way food is produced or processed.
They want to know more about pesticides, food additives and the nutrition value of the food they buy.
As people are more educated and informed about what they eat, they in turn want more convenient, prepared and ready-to-eat food.
Snacking have become increasingly present for those consumers.
For more than half of century, retail consolidation and the impact of fast-food chains and major discounters such as Wal-Mart or Costco have increased price pressure on growers and changed the consumer habits for good.
Retailers favourised their own private labels at the expense of the manufacturer's brands.
Retailers also want some insurance from suppliers that not only the product is of high quality but also safe and traceable.
Category management have become very popular and efficient for both buyers and suppliers.
To remain competitive, the produce industry may have to have to diversify not only in production (new varieties) but also in new marketing techniques (new markets, new products, processed products).
Consumption Over the last 10 years, the consumption of fruit (fresh only) remained relatively unchanged going from 62.18 kg per capita (KPC) in 1992 to 63.42 KPC in 2001.
With people becoming increasingly more health conscious, consumption went from fresh to processed and more "convenience" fruits (juices, processed and frozen).
Continued improvements in packaging, transportation and distribution have all contributed to the increase in per capita consumption of fresh and processed fruits and vegetables.
The two most favorite fresh fruit of Canadians are citrus and bananas (Table 18).
Apples are next.
Statistics Canada 1 % Change from 2001 to 2000
Opportunities or Challenges $ Liberalization of trade under the WTO should help Canadian exporters to continue to develop offshore markets.
$ Canada's shorter growing season reduces opportunities for market expansion into offshore markets.
Strong competition from earlier maturing U.S. crops tends to set the price and generally impacts negatively on growth opportunities.
$ Implementation of the new IFP guidelines should increase consumer confidence and industry acceptance in Canada and abroad.
IFP guidelines were developed on the basis of international systems such as Europe's EUREPGAP.
$ Favorable media reports on the health benefits of eating fruits and vegetables will continue to encourage future sales.
$ With practically no use of pesticides or chemical fertilizers during production, the wild blueberry production can be considered as "organic" and benefit from higher prices.
$ Future berry production is expected to increase, driven by a good demand from secondary processors such as bakeries for use in muffins, bagels, pies and the dairy sector for use by yogurt manufacturers.
$ Increased competition from Chinese fresh apples in Asian markets is expected to increase in coming years and will exert downward pressure on prices.
$ Continued favorable exchange rates should help Canadian exporters maintain market share in foreign markets.
$ Consolidation in the retail food sector and the increased popularity of large warehouse superstores are forcing producers, packers and distributors to reassess their marketing strategies.

Storage  History of Storage of Apples Storage of apples may have had its beginnings with the custom of burying barrels of apples in the ground, and covering them with soil and trash.
However crude this method was, it was probably the initial step in storage development, and without doubt, led to on-farm root cellars as a more sophisticated method of fruit storage.
Although with either of these methods, temperature could not be controlled, it usually tended to be constant at somewhere above freezing and was suitable for at least delaying, if not preventing, deterioration of the product stored.
On-farm root cellars, however primitive compared to today's cold storages, are still an effective means of storing perishable products, if the product is of a reasonable quality beforehand.
They have also helped to identify the need for better storage techniques.
In 1920, Canada got into the cold storage research business also, with research programs in storage being initiated at both Summerland, British Columbia, and Kentville, Nova Scotia.
In 1929, the first experimental cold storages were built, one at Summerland, British Columbia, and one at the Central Experimental Farm, Ottawa.
Cold storage apples are chilled to 0ºC in special chambers.
Since apples continue to live after picking, and breathe by using oxygen and giving off carbon dioxide, maintenance of the apples at a low temperature slows the respiration and thus retards the ripening process.
The humidity is also controlled.
Maintenance at around 85%, or higher, prevents loss of moisture by evaporation.
By the 1950's, research in a new storage technique called controlled atmosphere storage, had gained widespread interest.
Interestingly enough, controlled atmosphere storage techniques had been examined by several scientists previous to this, as early as the 1820's in fact, but unfortunately for the industry, all this work had gone unnoted or unused.
This new technique combined airtight refrigeration at 0ºC with an atmosphere reduced in oxygen, and with increased levels of carbon dioxide.
The resulting effect was that the ripening process slowed to a rate such that the apples could be maintained longer than under normal cold storage.
The first commercial C.A. storage was constructed at Frelighsburg, Québec in 1953.
Of vital importance to the storage of apples under these conditions, are two things: the apples must be of excellent quality, and the storage should be closed and sealed as quickly as possible after initial filling begins, to achieve the maximum benefits of the technique.
C.A. storages are closed under government supervision and must not be opened for at least 90 days after a seal is affixed, for the apples to be officially called C.A. apples.
With the development of cold storage, apples could be marketed for extended periods of time.
The implications of this technique on the industry were immediate and positive.
Instead of trying to market all his apples during a two month span in the fall, the producer was now able to sell "fresh" apples up until Christmas.
With the introduction of Controlled Atmosphere storage, the marketing season was extended until March and April, with further benefits to both growers and consumers.
The sale of the product over a longer period of time, resulted in a more even price distribution over the marketing season.
The consumer was able to buy "fresh" Canadian apples during many of the winter months previously bereft of local apples.
A further modification of the controlled atmosphere storage concept, simply called low oxygen storage, has been researched in recent years.
Canada is a world leader in the research work presently being conducted on the controlled atmosphere storage concept.
Few commercial enterprises have attempted this new storage method because of its increased complexity and cost.
Although the monetary benefits can be easily measured, and opportunities for sales of apples in the summer months are identified, the technique is still in research stages.
Apples can be stored by the low oxygen technique in chambers used for controlled atmosphere storage, but the gases in the chamber must be much more closely monitored under low oxygen storage.
The equipment needed to do this is also more highly specialized.
Three things are vital when considering low oxygen storage: one must be knowledgeable about the subject and prepared to spend both extra time and money on the project; the apples which go into such a storage must be of the highest quality and of specific maturity; and the apples must be chilled to the appropriate temperature and atmosphere mix as quickly as possible after harvest.
These three factors cannot guarantee success but can increase the likelihood that the project would reach a positive conclusion.
Present Storage Situation Canadian apple storage holdings by type of storage, by region of storage and by variety of apples show that developments in storage have followed the needs of the industry.
The volume of apples held in C.A. storage has been gradually increasing over the years.
As more C.A. storages are built, more and more apples are being held for extended periods.
Apple storage data is collected monthly, October to July, in each province across Canada and reports are made available to the public by the second week of that month through the web site at http://www.agr.ca/infohort/. Reports available are:
Apple Storage by Type, Province and District  Provides data by provincial district and storage type (Controlled Atmosphere, Cold and Common).
Apple Storage by Type, Variety and Utilization  Provides data by provincial district and intended utilization (Fresh, Juice and Peeler)
Summary The availability of C.A. storage at a commercial level, has greatly extended the marketing season for apples.
Excellent C.A. apples now appear on supermarket shelves as late as July.
Of course, it is not economic for a grower to store all his apples in C.A. storage.
The ideal situation is to have a combination of cold and controlled atmosphere storages.

Agri-Food Past, Present & Future Report Indonesia December 2006
Table of Contents
Indonesia Country Report:
Overview Indonesia is located in Southeast Asia and is the world’s largest archipelago composed of more than 17,000 islands bordering Papua New Guinea, East Timor, and Malaysia.
Java island, the most populous island in the world, is home to over half of Indonesia’s total population.
The island is also home to Jakarta, Indonesia’s capital and largest city, with an approximate population of 8.8 million.
Indonesia has the world’s largest Muslim population of approximately 205 million.
Globally, Indonesia is perceived as an emerging market which has recovered from a number of past economic shocks and is making positive political and economic developments.
Economic growth is expected to continue due to a prominent agriculture sector, developing industry sector, and expanding services sector.
The country is also a strong international exporter and maintains a positive agricultural trade surplus.
Indonesia is a rapidly expanding market for Canadian agri-food and seafood exports, with Canadian exports to Indonesia growing a substantial 114% more than Indonesia’s worldwide imports, from 2003 to 2005.
The Indonesian consumer market is maturing, incomes are rising, and lifestyles are becoming increasingly busy.
Eating out is on the rise, and consumers are increasingly seeking functional food and beverages.
Healthy lifestyle and diet awareness and knowledge is slowly growing and making an impact on consumer eating and spending habits.
Canada - Indonesia Relations Canada and Indonesia have a long history of co-operation on a wide range of issues such as education, social equity projects, trade agreements, and initiatives to support reform and governance.
Diplomatic relations have existed between the two countries for over 50 years.
Canada and Indonesia also share membership in a number of international organizations, most notably APEC, IMF, IMO, OPEC, UN, and WTO.
Canada’s investment presence in Indonesia is quite strong, with Canadian foreign direct investment valued at $3.5 billion in 2004.
Canada-Indonesia relations are considerably influenced by participation in APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation).
APEC is composed of 21 members, many being located in the Asia-Pacific region, but also a number of countries located around the world, including Canada and the United States (U.S.). APEC’s purpose is to foster Asia-Pacific economic growth, freeing trade and investment, and to reinforce the strength of the regional community.
For more information on APEC and Canada-APEC relations visit the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada web site at http://www.asiapacific.ca . APEC’s web site can be found at http://www.apec.org .
Canada- Indonesia Ag Trade Exports (2005) Imports (2005) Trade balance (2005) $204.2 million $207.9 million ($3.7 million)
Indonesia’s Canadian product imports increased 18% from 2004 to 2005, and processed food products rank as the third most opportunistic Canadian export market to Indonesia.
The majority of Canadian agricultural exports to Indonesia are cereals.

Animal feed was the second largest import at 15.2% ($1 billion), followed by sugars and sugar confectionary which accounted for 12.1% ($795.8 million).
Indonesia imports an approximate 1.5 million tonnes of sugar in order to supply a domestic sugar demand of 3 million tonnes.
In 2005, bulk and cereal grains composed 79% of Canada’s agri-food and seafood exports to Indonesia and have historically held a similar position.
Canada’s Top 5 Agricultural Exports to Indonesia (2005) Wheat, non-durum Soybeans Malt extract Animal Feed Frozen fries $157.5 million $12.4 million $9.3 million $5.9 million $5.0 million

However, the majority of Indonesia’s population is opposed to these reforms.
Consumption is expected to continue to drive economic growth in 2006 and economic recovery is projected to continue in the future.
A number of developments are providing positive markers for Indonesia’s economic future.
2004 Tsunami relief efforts have been successful and there has been considerable cooperation among the government, armed forces, and aid workers.
Indonesia is no longer included on the OECD Financial Action Task Force’s list of uncooperative countries.
A major peace process has also begun with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding, which has ended a 29 year political conflict between the government and the Free Aceh Movement in the province of Aceh.
Current:
• GDP in 2005 was comprised of GDP US$281.3 billion agriculture (13.4%), industry (45.8%), and services (40.8%).
• All major Indonesian sectors have GDP/capita US$ 1, 256 a key role in the economy.
Agriculture has historically been a GDP/capita (PPP) $4, 364 dominant sector, however the services sector is growing and the mining and manufacturing sectors play a prominent part in the economy.
• Major natural resources are oil, natural gas, tin, bauxite, copper, nickel, coal.
There are also small resources of silver, gold, diamonds, and rubies.
• Main industries are oil, gas, textiles, timber, coffee, rubber, coal, tin, copper, rice, pepper, and palm oil.
• Indonesia supplies over 80% of Southeast Asia’s oil and over 35% of worldwide liquefied gas.
• Exports have been a large factor in Indonesia’s growth, with semi-processed and manufactured products dominating the export market.
Gross Domestic Product (2005)
Indonesia’s merchandise import growth surpassed export growth in 2005, with growth of 26.2% and 21.8% respectively.
Total Indonesian imports grew 16% from 2004 to 2005.
Private consumption expenditure has been expanding since 1999 and has played a significant role in economic growth.
Inflation was 7.2% in 2005, and the unemployment rate was 9.4%.
Bank Indonesia has been executing a tight monetary policy, and aiming for a government inflation target of 7-9%.
Fiscal policy was more expansive in 2006, with the Government promoting infrastructure development.
Considerable cuts were made to fuel subsidies, which have long been straining the fiscal budget.
Forecast:
• GDP growth is projected to slow slightly in 2006, with an estimated annual growth of 5.5%, and increase in 2007 with growth of 5.7%.
An average growth of 6.6% a year is expected for the economy from 2005 to 2009.
• From 2004-2009, development policies and strategies combined with market reforms are expected to result in favourable macro-economic conditions.
• In the second half of 2006, interest rates are expected to decrease as a result of exchange rate stabilization and decreased pressure on year-on-year inflation rates.
An approximate interest rate of 10% is expected for the end of 2006 and external debt ratios are predicted to steadily decline.
• Inflation is expected to stay within the 2006 target of 7-9%.
• Social welfare is also expected to improve and the poverty rate is projected to decline to 8.2% of the population in 2009.
In 2004, 16.7% of the population lived below the poverty line.
This new law, coupled with rebounding investment may help Indonesia’s economy to reach a more sustainable level.
• In 2007, a less stringent monetary situation and lower inflation are expected to significantly improve Indonesia’s domestic demand.
• Significant surpluses are predicted for 2006 and 2007, due to expected high levels of merchandise exports.
Consumer Market Indonesia has a population of approximately 234 million growing at a rate of 1.4% annually.
By 2010, the population is expected to reach 245 million and as the population grows, so will population density and urbanization.
Despite government efforts to control migration flows, urbanization continues to spread.
In 2005, the urban population composed 45% of the total population and is expected to grow 54% from 2000 to 2015.
Java island is experiencing extreme urbanization.
The entire island is now one large city where more than half the Indonesian population resides.
Approximately 8.8 million Indonesian’s live in the city of Jakarta.
Demographics
•
•
• Indonesia has a fairly young population with a median age of 26 years.
The overall population is maturing gradually, with a median age of 29 years projected for 2015.
Declining fertility rates and increased life expectancy, due to improved education, living conditions, and health awareness, are the reasons for this maturing population.
The age structure of the population is as follows: 0-14 years (29%), 15-64 years (66%), 65 years and older (5%).
Population age groups under 20 years of age are projected to decrease between 1.4-3.6% from 2000 to 2015, whereas population age groups that are 45 years or older are expected to grow between 65-70%.
300 ethnic groups are present in the country, with 88% of the population being Muslim.
• Almost 40% of households were located in the highest income bracket in 2003.
This number is significantly higher than the income bracket with the next largest number of households, which was roughly 9% of total Indonesian households.
The proportion of households in the lowest income bracket is decreasing, while the number of households in the highest income bracket had an estimated growth of 46% from 2000 to 2003 and continues to increase.
In 2005, consumer expenditure grew 2% and totalled US$157.6 billion.
Food is a large portion of the average Indonesian’s per capita expenditures, accounting for 55% of total expenditure in 2004.
Consumer expenditure on food and non-alcoholic beverages is projected to grow by 80% from 2000 to 2015.
Compared with food expenditure, expenditure on alcoholic beverages is very low; however there is a trend towards more expenditure on alcoholic beverages and less on common beverages.
Packaged food expenditure has increased due to a larger consumer base and more frequent consumption; overall consumption is still fairly low.
Lifestyle and Diet
•
•
December 2006
Alcohol consumption is low because Indonesia is a largely Muslim state and even non-Muslim Indonesians do not drink significant amounts.
Bottled water, ready to drink tea and fruit/vegetable juice are very popular.
Consumers generally prefer fresh food to packaged food as it is perceived as healthier.
• Consumers are becoming more sophisticated, incomes are rising, and consumers with middle-to-upper level incomes are increasing.
These factors provide a growing customer base and opportunity for high-value, value-added products in the Indonesian market.
With consumers’ increasingly busy lifestyles and health awareness, there is an overall growing demand for functional food and beverage products.
Packaged food retail sales were expected to grow by more than 15% in 2005.
Frozen processed food was expected to grow the strongest, by 31% in 2005, and manufacturers are offering more specific and varied products.
In packaged food, there is a trend toward smaller packaging, particularly singleservings and refill packs.
Health and nutritional awareness is expected to lead to a growing trend toward white meat and seafood consumption, while red meat consumption will decline.
Increasing product availability in retail and foodservice is expected to further improve fish and seafood consumption.
Fresh fish and seafood are most popular, however frozen fish and seafood are growing in popularity.
Consumers are beginning to perceive fish and seafood as a healthier source of protein compared with alternative meat products.
This trend is predominantly visible in the younger generation; 15 years to early 30’s.
There is large potential for wheat flour due to the popularity of noodles and baked goods and the presence of in-house bakery formats in retailing.
Annual flour consumption is among the lowest in the world, leaving considerable room for growth in this industry as wheat-based products become increasingly popular with consumers.
Retailing
Hypermarkets grew the fastest of all grocery retail channels in 2005, with surface area growth of 51% and outlet growth of 55%.
Despite the rapid growth of modern retailing, ‘other’ grocery retailers composed 95% of all grocery outlets and nearly 56% of grocery sales.
Another intra-regional trade incentive is the close geographic proximity of member countries.
However, Canada is a large trading partner with ASEAN, which places Canada in a good position with respect to Canadian-Indonesian trade.
While strong intra-regional trade among ASEAN members is expected to continue, Indonesia’s agri-food and seafood imports are not primarily supplied by ASEAN countries.
• Japan is a major trading partner with Indonesia and has become the country’s largest export market, surpassing the U.S. Indonesia’s top 5 import sources in 2005:
Australia (19%), U.S. (16%), Thailand (11%), China (6%), and Argentina (6%).
Australia mainly supplies cereals, dairy products, bird eggs, honey, cotton, live animals, and sugars and sugar confectionary.
The U.S. supplies oilseeds, cotton, food industry residues and waste, dairy products, bird eggs, honey, and edible fruit and nuts.
Access Issues Indonesian government control of food imports and distribution has lessened in recent years, however heavy import regulation still exists.
All food and agriculture import products require registration with the National Agency of Drugs and Food
A 10% value-added-tax is levied on all agriculture product imports: meat and live cattle included.
Fresh produce imports must have a phytosanitary certificate which can be obtained from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) http://www.inspection.gc.ca/. Upon arriving in the country, products are subject to a plant quarantine inspection.
Alcoholic beverages face greater access issues, being strictly controlled and charged with sizeable excise rates.
Food labelling must be in Indonesian and include the following information: product name, ingredient list, net weight/volume, manufacturer/importer name and address, Halal information, and expiry date.
The BPOM registration number, production code, and ‘use by’ date are also mandatory on food labels.
When entering the Indonesian agriculture import market it is important to appoint a reliable business partner and to arrange face-to-face meetings as often as possible.
Business partners can be very beneficial as major importers generally have their own network distribution and facilities for cold storage.
Distributors generally add a 10% mark-up.
Participating in main trade shows is also a beneficial forum for gaining entrance to the market.
Business Travel Tips
• Modest, ‘business casual’ attire is acceptable.
A business suit, batik shirt, or dress for women, is commonly worn in business situations.
Hand shaking should be done with the right hand.
Business cards are frequently used.
Offer and accept cards with your right hand and treat the business cards of others with respect.
• 11% of Indonesia’s land is arable, 7% is used for permanent crops, and 45,000 sq km is irrigated.
Of the ASEAN countries, Indonesia has by far the largest amount of arable land.
Indonesia has long been a prominent palm oil producer, and in 2006 the country surpassed Malaysia to become the world’s largest producer.
There are currently expansion plans underway to establish the largest palm plantation in the world.
Main agriculture products are rice, cassava (tapioca), peanuts, rubber, cocoa, coffee, palm oil, copra, poultry, beef, pork, and eggs.
Rice, sugar, coconuts, and corn represent approximately 94% of Indonesia’s domestic crop production.
Chicken is the most produced type of meat, followed by pork.
However, Indonesians do not consume large amounts of pork and the majority of domestic production is exported to Singapore.
The country still experiences substantial problems with the quality of dairy cattle breeding and stock.
There is an active fish and seafood fishing sector and cultivation also plays a role in supporting the fish and seafood industry.
Indonesia does not possess very modern fishing technology which has a negative effect on the quality of domestic fresh fish.
Imported fish and seafood products are directly distributed and sold to modern retail outlets, hotels, and restaurants.
materials are often directly imported by food processors, with complementary ingredients commonly purchased from local agents.
Organic farming is still very limited in Indonesia.

Market Information Southeast Asia Food and Beverage Retail Report - Singapore February 2003 Prepared for the Canadian High Commission, Singapore by Jennifer C. S. Norris
Table of Contents Introduction The Singapore Market  The Retail Sector (grocery trade) Supermarkets in Singapore The Players and their Market Schedule of Listing Fees Canadian Opportunities - Trends and Constraints  Food and Beverage Retail Survey  Company Index Conclusions  Key Government Contacts and Sources of Information
Introduction The Food & Beverage Retail Report has been devised as a handbook of practical information for use by Canadian agri-food exporters whose preliminary research has identified the Singapore market for possible penetration, whether solely within the country or as a strategy into the region.
This document has been created as an update of the original report carried out by the Canadian High Commission of Singapore and published in January 2000.
The objective is to provide an updated and qualified list of active companies who have indicated interest in importing and distributing Canadian agri-food products for the retail market.
All companies listed within this report have responded to a retail survey conducted through the Commercial Section of the Canadian High Commission in Singapore.
The survey was conducted over a period of three weeks in December 2002.
Data was derived from the survey,s 11 predominantly close-ended question.
Additional information on the specific product group interests and future intentions were conducted through a random sampling of respondents with an additional interview process, to both extract greater specifics as well as validate information gathered through the survey.
These interviews were conducted in the first part of January 2003.
A total of 52 companies responded by returning the survey form.
This report also summarizes information related to the general business climate in Singapore as well as background information related to the Retail Food & Beverage Industry.
Profiles of the leading supermarkets, as well as recent changes and developments in this sector are covered in this report.
The background information on the business climate was obtained through various statistics provided by the Government of Canada, the Government of the Republic of Singapore, and various authorities within Singapore.
The Canadian High Commission in Singapore hopes that this report will assist Canadian agri-food exporters to more accurately target their product offerings, and speed potential business connections within Singapore.
Companies who are interested in pursuing businesses listed in this report are encouraged to use the contact information provided in the index for each of these companies.
The Singapore Market Singapore, an island city-state located at the tip of peninsular Malaysia in the heart of Southeast Asia, has an area of about 648 km².
In spite of its small size and lack of natural resources, Singapore,s over 3-million population enjoys one of the most affluent per-capita GDPs in Asia at approximately US$24,000 (S$44,000).
Singapore,s trade was about 2.7 times the size of its GDP in 1999.
Singapore,s business strengths focus mainly on utilizing its free trade policy along with the country,s position in the heart of the Asia-Pacific region.
Singapore,s excellent business services, financial and manufacturing sectors are supported by one of the busiest ports and largest container ports in the world.
Its efficient Changi international airport allows a free-flow of people and goods to Singapore, both as a destination as well as a gateway to ASEAN and Pacific Rim markets.
A pro-business approach to policy and processes has given Singapore a list of accolades which include World,s 2nd freest economy (Economic Freedom of the World: 2002 Annual Report); Fifth least corrupt nation (Corruption Perception Index 2002); Best airport worldwide (IATA 2002); World,s 5th most competitive economy (World Competitiveness Yearbook 2002); and, World,s 4th most competitive economy (Global Competitiveness Report 2002).
In spite of its economy being hard-hit by the Asian Financial Crisis of the late 1990s, the country,s sound legal framework, clean and efficient government, emphasis on education and science and technology, good labour/employer relations, competitive telecommunications and increasingly competitive financial system makes the island-state a safe bet for continued international business.
Regional Singapore has been historically recognized as Southeast Asia,s distribution hub, and has been the base of operations for many food and beverage importers and exporters, providing administrative and financial support for business establishments in other countries in the region.
This role, however, may be daunted in the future by the additional infrastructure being completed around Southeast Asia.
Shipping destinations at Johor Bahru and Port Klang in Malaysia will challenge the country,s ability to maintain its part as a trans-shipment point for the region.
However, Singapore,s long-standing ability to 'facilitate, around the region, tapping on computer and communications technology, incentives, and financial support, should retain its title as a vibrant entrance and distribution point for international business.
Notwithstanding the repercussions of the Asian economic crisis, Singapore has continued to pursue liberal trade and investment policies and to deepen internal reform, especially in key services.
A new WTO report on Singapore's trade policies says that Singapore has weathered the recent economic crisis in the region well mainly due to its stable and sound macroeconomic policies and its open trade and investment regime."
World Trade Organization, Press Release, 22 March 2000.
The Retail Sector (grocery trade) Description Singapore continues to be considered one of the most developed food retail markets in Southeast Asia.
With high disposable income, the monthly per capita food expenditure is S$219.30, based on the most recent Singapore Statistics Household Expenditure Survey (1997/98).
This amount comprises an average monthly per capita expenditure of S$99.60 and S$119.70 on non-cooked and cooked food respectively.
Due to the dearth of agricultural land on the island, Singaporeans are more dependent on imported food and beverage, resulting in higher expenditure on food products compared to neighbouring countries.
Catering primarily to household consumption, the grocery trade can be generally divided into three main categories of marketing channels and distribution.
Provision shops are no-frills, small stores usually set up in highly populated residential areas to cater specifically to those "block" areas.
They are usually family run and staffed.
Mini-marts offer a slightly broader range of products in a more comfortable setting which increasingly includes some air conditioning.
Supermarkets (added together by Statistics Singapore as Supermarkets and Departmental Stores cum Supermarkets) provide an extensive selection of products and tend to offer higher end products in the mix within an air-conditioned environment.
There are some general trends that have occurred from 1987.
This is due to the reduced number of general provision shops and the increased number of both mini-marts and supermarkets.
While these two latter categories have more than doubled their numbers since 1987, the number of provision shops has plummeted.
Number of Stores in Grocery Trade There may be several reasons for this shift.
Economic growth and generally higher incomes have enabled individuals to shop in establishments with greater selection and comfort.
The shift from provision shop to mini-mart seems to also hold advantages for small entrepreneurs in that these mini-marts are often franchised and provide the owner with better management systems, stock control and more effective purchasing power.
For those with good business savvy, existing provision shops have been "up-grading" to mini-marts.
With the emergence of both national and international supermarket chains, which tend to be more aggressive in their marketing strategies, the number of stores has risen from 60 in 1987 to about 153 in 2000.
These establishments also provide a much higher level of employment as they have expanded, compared to provision shops or mini-marts.
As the supermarkets continue to consolidate and increase their buying power, they will become an even greater force in Singapore.
Even after the tough economic climate of the late 1990s, the grocery trade has grown.
From 1987 to 1997 turnover increased at about 7.2 per cent annually, supporting the growing population and the increased demand for grocery products amongst consumers.
Turnover by Store Format Supermarkets recorded the highest growth, especially between 1997 and 2000.
Some factors that have supported the trend towards supermarket shopping are that supermarkets have been moving into the "heartlands" of residential housing for increased access.
Individuals are also becoming more affluent and savvy to a wider variety of foods and grocery products, thus demanding a wider range of goods.
Finally, the number of working women continues to increase.
This group tends to prefer shopping in supermarkets for convenience, atmosphere and value for money.
It looks as though these trends will continue to make supermarket shopping a preferred, although not exclusive, choice for Singaporean grocery shoppers in the future.
Even within the category of supermarket, there has been and increase in the focus of target market levels that range from upmarket to discount format.
The players, their store numbers and markets are listed below.
Carrefour This well-known hypermarket from France is present in 31 countries around the world and entered the Singapore scene within the last four years.
Known for its deep pockets, this hypermarket did not expand quickly to additional locations and remained with its one (1) flagship store within the central business district since inception.
Its broad, international variety of food and beverage products stems mostly from European, and predominantly French, sources.
It was recently announced, however, that it will finally be opening a second store in Plaza Singapura, at the heart of one of the new public mass transit interchanges in the central city and shopping area.
Carrefour Singapore Pte Ltd  3 Temasek Boulevard #01-043  Suntec City Mall, Singapore 038983  Tel: +65 6333 6868  Singapore@carrefour.com Giant Giant offers a wide range of local merchandise and a wet market environment.
Following the successful launch of this format of stores in Malaysia, Giant,s emphasis of its stores is "Ethnic and Fresh".
There are presently three (3) hypermarket stores in Singapore, opened in relative quick succession.
Giant is a 100% owned company of the Dairy Farm Group, who also own Cold Storage (G,value and Jason,s described below).
Dairy Farm Group also owns 7-Eleven Convenience Stores, as well as Guardian Pharmacies across Singapore.
There are 25 outlets under the Cold Storage label, one (1) Jason,s store which is positioned as more of a "purveyor of fine food and wine", four (4) Market Place stores which cater to the upper income markets, and nine (9) G,Value shops, which have been positioned to target local value-conscious residents looking for everyday needs.

In 2002, FairPrice was in the process of building a central fresh food distribution centre to increase cost savings over the long term.
FairPrice continues to have the highest number of outlets positioned throughout all areas of Singapore.

With the mission of "Great Value Always" Shop N Save has expanded using its major discounter entry position.
The company now has 35 outlets around the country.
QAF Ltd and Delhaize "The Lion" Group are both owners in this supermarket chain and are looking to expand aggressively into the regional market.

As suggested by its name, Shing Shiong caters more to local fare and tastes.
A minor player in the supermarket scene, the company has six (6) outlets in Singapore.
Schedule of Listing Fees Singapore is the first country in the Southeast Asian region to implement slotting fees.
While not all supermarkets practice this fee structure, two of the biggest supermarket players, Cold Storage and NTUC FairPrice do.
Below are examples of slotting listing fees that give an example of the potential costs for products being brought to Singapore.
Canadian Opportunities - Trends and Constraints Generally, the Singapore market is a good one to enter into for Canadian agri-food producers.
There is an affluent and expanding market within the country and many of the Singaporean importers and exporters of products are interested in taking advantage of their regional hub position to expand into Southeast Asia and beyond.
Singapore, however, is extremely price conscious.
With the increasingly savvy population, innovative and value-added products are in higher demand, but with a cost sensitivity that should be noted.
Agri-food products imported into Singapore must conform to regulatory requirements.
Health certificates and supporting documentation are needed for meat, poultry and seafood items.
Canada and Singapore have agreed to specific import regulatory requirements for most meat imports, including bison.
However, other exotic meats currently do not have agreements in place.
The issue of Halal products, those that are handled and processed within the requirements of the Muslim community, is becoming increasingly important for widespread acceptance in Singapore.
Many importers and questioning the viability of non-Halal certified food and beverage products in this country and region.
Major agri-food sources to Singapore include Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and some of the European countries.
Their perceived proximity, compared to North America and especially Canada, gives them an advantage of being top of mind.
More often than not, proximity is associated with lower cost and increased freshness.
Based on the interviews conducted for this survey, Canada can take advantage of its exchange rate to differentiate itself from the United States.
Canada seems recognized as a high quality producer of food and beverage products but may need to take advantage of goods that have added value as opposed to commodity level products.
However, with the question of safe supplies of products, and specifically in meats, secondary sourcing may be a valuable opportunity for Canada.
Comments from some of the companies interviewed suggested that "healthy" was an increasing buzzword in Singapore - organic, health, fresh.
It was also indicated that convenience foods - frozen goods that can be place in chillers and are ready to serve, from meals to desserts - are in increasing demand, both for retail customers as well as food services.
Adding to the convenience trend, Petrol (gas) station grocery outlets are becoming increasingly popular for basic goods, confectionery products and ready-to-serve items.
Canada,s reputation as a solid supplier needs to be backed with a willingness to build a relationship with Singapore importers.
With the size of the Singapore market remaining small, the need for consolidators or the facilitation of smaller orders will be key in accessing and expanding in this market.

As a predominantly fresh food arm, the company presently brings in strawberries from California as well as other berries from the USA by air.
Salads for the company are sourced from Europe.
However, they would be interested in finding other suppliers to bring in a wide variety of products, noting that freight, transit periods and handling are all going concerns.
Forecore at the moment has a tendency to be pro-European in their product line, due to proximity as well as subsidies.
The company's work with modified packaging is increasing their interest in short shelf life products and items from further away.
Future plans for the company are to open large, urban-based gourmet shops, with the possibility of a North American area to highlight specialties.
Competitive cheese and dairy, pastry products, deli meats, berries, seafood (oysters) and other niche or gourmet products are of interest to the company.
Their interests in the bakery business may increase their needs for innovative expansion products and supplies.
The company has a good awareness of Canada and has a long history with the country.

All parts of the company are aiming at the high upper-middle end of the market.
Halal products are seen as very important for sales in Singapore especially convenience products, frozen pastries, ready to eat and pre-packaged foods.
As a supplier for convenience stores in Singapore, desserts and frozen cheesecakes are increasingly popular.
The situation in Singapore is very price competitive.
The market for frozen convenience (both retail as well as food services) is growing and there is a dearth of innovative products.
Convenience products in the dry goods area is also something that the company is interested to look into.
Products for both retail and food services GTK has been looking for Canadian suppliers for food products.
They are interested in locating products that are "innovative", "meaningful", "funky" - items with nice packaging, a great taste, with the concept of "natural" foods running through their line.
They are open to many ranges with value-added products and gourmet foods as a specialty.
Possible products of interest are organic or natural cereals, gourmet soda pops like root beer, premium ice cream and dairy products.
Soy-based snacks must be flavourful (as must all foods for the Singapore market) - bland foods in this spice-taking country does not sell as well.
GTK provide for food service as well as their own restaurants and are in the market for bakery goods and ready cooked foods as there tends to be limited kitchen sizes that cafes are working with.
The company is planning to expand into Malaysian a much more aggressive way in the future.
While the Canadian dollar is favourable at the moment, shipping costs seem to be of concern.

Meidiya Japan, in a joint venture, owns part of Meidi-ya Singapore Co.
Either through Meidi-ya Japan or Lim Mah Tat, the companies Nor-Scan and Be Fresh are associated to the group.
This gives them group buying power and they can take advantage of some of the cost advantages where possible.
However, even with this larger purchase power, the company feels it is buying small quantities and is looking for a consolidator in Canada for regular consignments of meat, cheese, salad, and seafood products.
The company is also looking for high quality beef products.
As of 1 April 2003, the company will be taking over on the retail front to own a retail supermarket.
This will open up an avenue for providing products to the store directly.
Part of the Meidiya associated group (see Meidiya company write up).
Products the company are interested in include clams, oysters, hokigai, and whelks.
The quantities that are ordered are on the low volume end.
Smoked salmon which might have been sourced from North America is now sourced locally.
The company is also getting sausages from the USA - with the Euro going up, they are looking to North America for purchases.

Conclusions In the area of Food and Beverage Retail, the information and statistics provided in this report should provide Canadian companies with some basic tools to use when approaching potential import/export or development partners in Singapore.
There appear to be many Singapore businesses that are looking for long-term partnerships with innovative products.
As Singapore remains a smaller market, these companies are looking to work with Canadian companies to find solutions which lead to mutually beneficial relationships.

______________________________________________________________________________ The Government of Canada has prepared this report based on primary and secondary sources of information.
Readers should independently verify the accuracy and reliability of the information.
This report is intended as a concise overview of the market for those interested in its potential and is not intended to provide in-depth analysis which may be required by the individual exporter.
Malaysia COUNTRY PROFILE Economy Malaysia is one of the fastest growing economies in the world.
Malaysia has developed from an agriculture based economy to an industrial manufacturing based economy, though the country maintains strong manufacturing, service and agricultural sectors.
Malaysia is export oriented and is particularly reliant on the export of electronics.
Malaysia is both politically and economically stable and is open to foreign investment.
Overview The Malaysian government has laid out a vision for the country’s economy.
The vision is working to increase the country’s GDP eightfold helping the country achieve "industrialized country" status by the year 2020.
The foundation of this national development is privatization, while maintaining an emphasis on foreign investment to support industrialization.
Manufacturing is central to the economy and the country is heavily reliant on a healthy export market for its industry.
One of the most important industries in Malaysia is the food manufacturing industry.
There is a range of businesses in the industry, from small family owned operations to large international companies.
Major manufactured products include refined sugar, wheat flour and baked products, non-alcoholic beverages, edible oil, dairy products, confectionery and snacks, fish and seafood products, beer, canned pineapple and processed meat.
The food processing industry is expected to expand in the future.
Current situation Malaysia’s GDP has seen healthy growth since since 1998, with the exception of 2001 when a global slowdown negatively affected Malaysia’s export oriented economy.
Growth returned in occurred in 2002 and has continued in 2003.
Consumer confidence has increased, and has been shown through purchases of large items, increased consumer credit and mortgage approvals, and an increase in the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange.
Investor confidence has also increased, as applications for foreign direct investment have increased.
The unemployment rate in Malaysia is quite low at approximately 3.5%.
However, about 8% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Government Role The government is actively involved in the development and industrialization of the Malaysian economy.
This includes state sector investment, a close alliance between the government and the private business sector, privatizing state enterprises, and a variety of policies and programs to bolster the economic status of Malaysian communities.
The role of the government in agriculture is to provide support to facilitate the business and development activities of the private sector and of producers.
Consumer Market The largest percentage of the Malaysian population, about half, are Malays.
This group is followed by Chinese, making up approximately 25%.
Total Population Population Growth Rate Breakdown by Age 0-14 yrs 15-64 yrs 65 yrs and over Life Expectancy Male Female Total
semi-prepared foods or takeaway meals and can afford to do so.
This group is increasingly exposed to global and western influences and will be a driving force within Malaysia for higher value products, including food.
Geography Malaysia is located in southeastern Asia, sharing common borders with Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines.
The capital of Malaysia is Kuala Lumpur.
Muslims in Malaysia only eat beef and poultry products which have been approved by Malaysian authorities as "halal", or acceptable for consumption by Muslims.
They do not eat pork.
In contrast, Buddhists and Hindus do not eat beef.
Therefore, chicken meat is most popular in general.
There are 3650 square kilometers of irrigated land in Malaysia.
Natural resources include tin, petroleum, timber, copper, iron ore, natural gas and bauxite.
There are an estimated 400,000 hectares of idle agricultural land in Malaysia.
Industrial,
Infrastructure Malaysia has well developed transportation and communication infrastructure.
Malaysia has modern and efficient transportation services.
Major cities are connected by highways.
The majority of cargo shipments – about 90% – are transported by road.
Railway lines also connect the north, south, east and west coasts, in addition to the roadways.
All major cities have airports as well; there are seven international airports in Malaysia.
Approximately 90% of Malaysia’s imports are transported to the country by sea.
This makes the development of efficient ports very important.
More than two thirds of the people who frequent these restaurants are in the "teen" market.
Increasing direct shipments, intense restaurant competition, and a strong retail sector should allow the Malaysian food market to maintain growth.
Goods are generally marketed through agents or distributors who operate sales outlets in the major cities in Malaysia.
The products are then distributed to supermarkets, hotels, rural shops and other retail outlets.
Some of the larger supermarket chains are beginning to import directly from overseas.
Shipments through Singapore are declining as the ports in Malaysia improve.
This is to ensure the safety of the products and compliance with regulations and standards.
Malaysia’s economy rely’s on exporting.
Exports were valued at $131.2 billion, while imports were valued at $112.4 billion resulting in a positive trade balance of $19 billion.
Malaysia’s exports are dominated by electronic products and other manufactured goods, such as furniture.
Additional exports include: petroleum and liquefied natural gas, wood and wood products, palm oil, rubber,
______________________________________________________________________________ Country Profile:
Malaysia’s largest export partners include: the US, Singapore, the EU, Japan, Hong Kong.
Malaysia’s major import suppliers include:
Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Malaysia was strong, as a result of the privatisation, until the Asian economic crisis.
Foreign direct investment has been an important aspect of the development of Malaysia.
In the 1990s, the majority of investment went to the manufacturing sector, followed by oil and gas, services, and property.
However, this flow has decreased in recent years.
Competition from other markets such as China and less developed Southeast Asian countries has affected Malaysia.
The government has worked to bring investment to high technology, capital intensive manufacturing operations.
The top contributors of FDI to Malaysia are Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States.
Total inflows of FDI in 2001 were US$554 million.
The Malaysian Industrial Development Authority (MIDA) performs screening for all foreign and domestic investments.
As a member of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), Malaysia is involved in reducing trade barriers over a fifteen year period with fellow AFTA member.
These include Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos and Burma.
Malaysia is also a member of the following international organizations:
Malaysia 2003 7
Market Access Exporters of agri-food products to Malaysia face a number of challenges when entering the market.
The market for imported foods continues to be liberalized as tariffs are reduced for most products.
Luxury goods are heavily taxed, while goods such as raw materials, essential foodstuffs, and pharmaceutical products are subject to reduced duties.
Many other goods, which are to be used in Malaysia’s development, also benefit from lower duties.
Although tariffs have been reduced on a number of goods, certain sectors still have high rates in order to regulate imports.
Certification Requirements Imported meat products must be from approved halal facilities because the products cannot be sold to Muslims in Malaysia unless they are certified halal.
Imports from China also require special permits.
If a specific license is not required, a "Declaration of Goods Imported" form must be filled out at the point of import.
Documentation is generally handled by international freight forwarders.
Packaging and Labelling All imported consumer goods must be affixed with a label identifying the importing agent.
This is generally done after the goods have cleared customs.
Processed food products must show the name of the manufacturer and packer or importer on the product label as well as the weight or volume, common name, brand, content or list of ingredients in accordance to proportion by weight, animal product content, alcohol content, additives and storage instructions.
Expiry dates are required on certain produce, perishable foods, and goods with short shelf lives.
Nutritional information is optional except for baby food, processed food for children, cereal and food for dietary purposes.
Malaysian consumers are price sensitive.
Canadian products are not always pricecompetitive when compared to local products and imports from other neighboring countries.
The price sensitivity of consumers directly affects the sector’s buyers and their suppliers.
Peninsular Malaysia - rubber, palm oil, cocoa, rice; from Sabah - subsistence crops, rubber, timber, coconuts, rice; and from Sarawak rubber, pepper; timber.
The deficit is expected to continue as a result of economic factors that limit Malaysia’s capabilities.
Malaysia needs to increase the competitive capabilities of food production within the country, however, the agricultural sector faces challenges such as acute labour shortages, limited availability of suitable land and increasing cost of production.
Competition for resources from other sectors and competition in the global market has contributed to these challenges.
Strong local brands that have foreign origin, for example Nestlé and Coca Cola, command strong positions in their market segments.
Agriculture and Agri-food Overview and Outlook
The agriculture sector plays a rapidly diminishing role in Malaysia’s economy.
Over 3,500sq km of land is irrigated.
Malaise’ primary agricultural products include: from
other sectors and expand into new areas, while maintaining the ability to conserve and utilize natural resources.
The specific objectives of the NAP3 are: to enhance food security; to increase productivity and competitiveness of the sector; to deepen linkages with other sectors; to create new sources of growth for the sector; and to conserve and utilize natural resources on a sustainable basis.
Initiatives to promote new products and emerging industries such as agroforestry, biotechnology products, specialty natural products, bamboo and rattan, floriculture and aquarium fish are expected to be sources of growth for the agricultural sector.
Although land expansion is not likely to occur, productivity is expected to increase during the NAP3 period, due to increased labour productivity.
This will reflect the emphasis put on labour saving technology, innovations and more efficient farm management practices.
As well, moderate expansion of land will still be pursued in some areas, such as agroforestry, oil palm, and fruit and vegetable cultivation.
This will require key elements of the country’s economic foundation, such as human resources, technology, physical infrastructure, finance and incentives, and supporting industries and institutions, to be continuously developed.
New Zealand is the leading exporter of dairy products to Malaysia, Australia is the leading exporter of meat products, and both countries are among the top exporters of fresh fruit and vegetables and wines.
These two countries have the advantage of shorter, and therefore cheaper, shipping times.
China is among the leading exporters of fresh fruits, along with Thailand and Indonesia.
Trade organizations such as the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers and the government agency, Malaysia External Trade Development Corporation (MATRADE), aggressively promote and assist Malaysia’s food industry export market.
Canada - Malaysia Trade and Investment
The Canadian and Malaysian governments have developed a good relationship since Malaysia's independence in 1957.
This relationship has been strengthened by the two countries' record of cooperation as members of the Commonwealth, the United Nations and the World Trade Organization; as participants in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum, which deals with security issues; and through ASEAN itself, of which Canada is a dialogue partner.

Agri-Food Regional Profile of ASEAN
Michael Ash Trade Evaluation and Analysis Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada ashmi@agr.gc.ca
The Government of Canada has prepared this report based on primary and secondary sources of information.
Readers should take note that the Government of Canada does not guarantee the accuracy of any of the information contained in this report, nor does it necessarily endorse the organizations listed herein.
Readers should independently verify the accuracy and reliability of the information.
This report is intended as a concise overview of the market for those interested in its potential and is not intended to provide in-depth analysis which may be required by the individual exporter.
Executive Summary ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) is a regional group that has, over the last two decades, become more interested in increased economic integration between its members.
ASEAN members are a highly heterogeneous group, with political structures ranging from democracies to military dictatorships, and certain development rivalling that of Western Europe coupled with some of the poorest countries in the world.
Even though the overall region is relatively poor, strong real GDP growth, both recorded and forecast, make this an interesting and potentially lucrative market.
Canadian agri-food and seafood exports to ASEAN are small and confined to only a few products, wheat and soybeans being the most important.
In 2003, exports were valued at $506 million.
Trade and domestic economic liberalization coupled with rising incomes makes ASEAN a potential growth market for Canadian goods.
History and Future of ASEAN ASEAN was created in 1967 by five member states – Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand initially as a mechanism to protect against a perceived Communist threat within the region.
It has since expanded to include Brunei (1984), Cambodia (1999), Laos (1997), Myanmar (1997) and Viet Nam (1995) and has arguably become the most successful economic association primarily involving developing countries.
Much of the group’s initial dialogue consisted of non-economic issues, such as regional stability and peace.
Starting in 1992, there was a dramatic shift to better address common economic concerns.
One of the most important principles agreed upon was the establishment of an ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA).
The AFTA, formalized in 1993, requires that the first six member countries register most product classifications as part of their Inclusion List (IL).
The items in their inclusion lists were then proscribed to fall to tariff levels between zero and five per cent, with 60 per cent at zero.
As of 2003, 99.6 per cent were in this range.
ASEAN Secretariat
The direction of ASEAN’s economic focus is oriented towards greater trade liberalization.
It is optimistically scheduled that there will be zero tariffs on all intra-ASEAN trade by 2015 and a single market for goods, services and investments by 2020.
Agriculture has been identified as one of the priority markets that requires added attention in the integration process.
Because of increased linkages between the regions and a confluence of domestic regulations, ASEAN members have also indicated interest in branding ASEAN, using methods such as "Made in ASEAN" labelling.
Similar to the beginnings of the European Union, ASEAN is increasing presenting a common front in bilateral trade negotiations.
Talks have started with both China and India and ASEAN members are optimistic that free trade areas with these countries can be negotiated and completed by 2010 and 2016, respectively.2 The ASEAN Economy Unlike many other regional associations, ASEAN did not form out of then-present common political ideologies or economic circumstances.
The only common factor that linked them was geographical proximity.
Although the countries remain at highly different levels of development, it is their new-found common outlook for the economic development of the region that joins them.
Population Population growth 2
"ASEAN seeks to fast-track economic integration," AFP, Jan.
Other measures of development, such as international aid per capita, reveal similar heterogeneity between countries as with incomes.
Net FDI flows, on the other hand, are less varied between countries and, in all cases but one, are positive inflows.
Their levels are low, relative to world levels, especially when compared against other stable, developing countries.
Within the last decade, all the countries have rapidly increased production of agricultural products (see table 2).
Livestock production has outpaced overall food production in the entire region, an indication that local producers are responding to increased domestic demand for high-value products resulting from rising incomes.
Land productivity as measured by cereal yield, for example, is relatively consistent among ASEAN.
Physical capital is much larger in the EU, as they record 94 tractors per thousand hectares in comparison to the ASEAN average of eight.
Given these large resource bases for European agriculture, with similar levels of inputs, ASEAN farmers would probably be able to easily increase production.
With rising wealth, these inputs should become more accessible to the average farmer.
FAO Statistics, World Development Indicators (World Bank).
Arable land is in millions of hectares in 2000, food production index in 2001 is such that 1989-91=100, livestock production index in 2001 is such that 1989-1991=100, cereal yield is in kilograms per hectare, fertilizer use is tonnes per thousand hectares of arable land in 2001, and tractor use is tractors per thousand hectares.
Other ASEAN members accounted for over 70 per cent of import demand.
As mentioned before, exports are small in comparison to Brunei’s imports.
In 2001, agri-food exports valued $1.6 million USD and imports $189.6 million USD.
The largest category of imports was cereals.
Some of the smaller categories in which it was a large importer were bakery products, beer, cigarettes, and fruits.
World Trade Atlas.
Canadian exports to this tiny country are very small, amounting to only a few hundred thousand dollars annually.
Table 4 describes the various commodities exported.
Although recent trends suggest that Canada has done well in Brunei, exports in 1995 exceeded $600,000.
Plantations have been encouraged and are focused on palm oil, cashews, coffee, tea, and vegetables.
Other important commodities were alcoholic beverages, malt extract, and milk products.
In that year, like many others, Canada did not export any agri-food and seafood products to Cambodia and thereby had no market presence.
Table 5 Canadian Agri-Food and Seafood Exports to Cambodia 2001 2002 2003 TOTAL AGRI-FOOD EXPORTS $0 $0 $22,000 Cookies $0 $0 $22,000 Source:
Canadian agri-food and seafood exports to Cambodia were nonexistent from 1998 to 2002; in 2003, exports were minimal, as seen in table 5.
Indonesia Like many of the other ASEAN countries, Indonesia has experienced a shaky foundation in the last fifteen years with both economic and political disturbances.
In primary crops, Indonesia is highly engaged in the production of rice, sugar, coconuts, and corn.
After chicken, the second-largest type of meat is, surprisingly, pork, which accounts for more than a quarter of meat production.
Most of the pork, however, is exported to Singapore.
Australia (20.2 per cent), the United States (18.6 per cent), China (11.2 per cent), India (7.2 per cent), and Thailand (5.9 per cent).
Overall, Indonesia’s main imports are basic commodities.
Table 6 outlines its main agri-food and seafood imports.
Much the same reason exists for cotton and oilseeds.
Canadian exports to Indonesia are almost exclusively focused on cereals.
Table 7 Canadian Agri-Food and Seafood Exports to Indonesia 2001 2002 2003 TOTAL AGRI-FOOD EXPORTS $152.6 $171.5 $93.8 Wheat and meslin, nondurum $132.0 $135.0 $65.2 Potatoes, frozen, prepared $1.5 $2.0 $7.2 Skim milk powder $1.8 $2.6 $4.3 Flour meal & pellets (not edible) $4.8 $6.0 $4.1 Wheat, durum $4.1 $2.9 $2.6 Source:
Canada supplied 29.3 per cent of Indonesia’s import demand of non-durum wheat in 2002.
In 2003, Canada’s exports fell considerably
Value-added products, on the other hand, have shown continued growth in this market.
For example, the export of frozen potatoes, many of which are used in French fries, is a large growth market.
Laos Laos, much like Cambodia and Myanmar, is extremely poor.
Overseas development aid makes up more than 13.5 per cent of GDP.
Because of widespread subsistence farming and lack of a highly developed export sector, Laos was relatively unaffected by the Asian crisis of the late 1990s.
It has enjoyed high real growth rates for the past few years and is projected to continue doing so.
Primary crop production is almost exclusively focused on rice, while pork dominates meat production.
Like Viet Nam, Laos does not produce its own trade data and, as such, are derived through indirect means.
Laos imported $70.4 million USD worth of agricultural products in 2001.
The largest sector by value was beverages and tobacco, followed by cereals and related preparations.
Canadian Agri-Food and Seafood Exports to Laos 2001 2002 2003 TOTAL AGRI-FOOD EXPORTS $0 $0 $0 Source:
As seen in table 8, Canadian agri-food and seafood exports to Laos simply do not exist.
The last recorded export in this category was in 1988.
In 2003, no exports of any sort flowed between Canada and Laos.
It has been projected that the country will be a net oil importer by the end of the decade, but that its large gas deposits will continue to provide significant revenues.
Domestic meat production is dominated by chicken.
On the whole, Malaysia is a net agri-food exporter, as 2002 values reveal that imports were $4.7 billion USD and exports were $7.4 billion USD.
Table 9 below outlines the broad import categories of Malaysia.
Malaysia imports a wide variety of agri-food and seafood products, which has resulted from its higher income and thereby more differentiated tastes of its citizens.
Value is in millions of American dollars.
The two countries that border Malaysia play significant roles in its trade patterns.
Thailand (15.3 per cent), China (13.8 per cent), Australia (12.3 per cent), Indonesia (10.4 per cent), and the United States (9.0 per cent).
Although the world exports a wide variety of products to Malaysia, Canada’s exports are concentrated in two products: soybeans and wheat.
Myanmar Myanmar is the poorest of the ASEAN members and one of the poorest in the world.
Its government is run by the military and there are international concerns over human rights.
As such, international corporations are reticent to enter the market because of the resulting negative perception domestically.8 Agriculture accounts for a significant portion of both the economy and the labour force: 59 and 66 per cent, respectively.
This is despite widespread hunger within the country.
Domestic primary crop production is focused on rice, in which output increased 28 per cent between 1998 and 2002.
Prior to 2000, Myanmar was a net agri-food importer but, since that time, it has become a net exporter.
Its largest exports are fruits and vegetables.
Similarly seen in many other poor countries, the leading broad import group is beverages and tobacco.

Value is in Canadian dollars.
For the last decade, export values have never really reached above the 2003 value.
Although the Philippines was more insulated during the Asian crisis of the late 1990s than its neighbours, they also had not so fully participated in the large international capital inflows.
Over the last few years, the Philippines has recorded the lowest real per capita GDP growth of any ASEAN member.
to boost the economy, the government has undertaken a major initiative to increase infrastructure and reform the tax system.
In the lives of everyday people, agriculture still plays a large role, as more than 36 per cent of the labour force is engaged in this sector, contributing 20 per cent of GDP.
World Trade Atlas.
Its exports were mostly primary goods such as bananas and coconut oil.
Imports, as outlined in table 12, were a varied group, consisting mainly of goods that are not wellsuited to the Philippine climate.
Before 2000, tobacco exports had been practically nonexistent.
Overall Canadian agri-food and seafood exports to this market have done extremely well, considering that mid-1990 values averaged slightly over $50 million.
Singapore Singapore is a small, highly open economy that has achieved significant wealth; GDP per capita is now on par with many Western industrialized countries.
Singapore has one of the world’s most open, trade-friendly economies, resulting from its high population density and the resulting lack of natural resources.
Singapore is home to the headquarters of over 3,000 multinational corporations and is a regional leader in exporting electronics.
Singapore is a large net agri-food and seafood importer, although this number is somewhat undervalued because of the significant impact of re-exports.
The largest exports were high value goods, such as beverages and tobacco products.
As for imports, table 14 outlines the leading categories.
Value is in millions of American dollars; Singapore does not record trade between itself and Indonesia
It should be noted that Singapore data do not include trade with Indonesia.
Above, in table 15, are Canada’s leading exports to Singapore.
Although not listed above, one major growth product has been the export of cured bacon.
This has seen annual growth of almost ten percent; in 2003, just under $1 million was exported.
Thailand Thailand has enjoyed rapid economic growth brought about by a wide industrial base that initially started in value-added agricultural goods that has since diversified.
A major component of the economy is tourism, which is seen as a cheap and exotic destination by young people.
The country’s open attitude to business, coupled with ongoing reforms of the fragile banking sector, should make the country extremely conducive to further investment.
This is confirmed by the fact that 40.5 per cent of the labour force is engaged in agriculture but the sector only contributes 13 per cent to GDP.
Thailand’s main production of primary crops is centered on sugar; Thailand is considered the world’s largest exporter.
In 2000, the government proposed increased subsidies to farmers and some debt relief.
To date, however, no action has been taken.9 Other important primary crops include rice, cassava, and rubber.
Because of its abundant natural resources, Thailand has emerged as a large net agri-food and seafood exporter.
In 2003, exports were 9
valued at $14.5 billion USD and imports at $4.6 billion USD, leaving a trade surplus of almost $10 billion USD.
Thai imports (see table 16) are interesting, considering that a significant portion is comprised of seafood products, half of which is various types of frozen tuna.
One area that has seen considerable growth is oilseeds, which is almost completely fuelled by demand for soybeans.
Value is in millions of American dollars.
Canada’s share in this market was 1.8 per cent.
Value is in millions of Canadian dollars.
Canadian trade with Thailand was down in 2003 over previous years, substantially because of lessened wheat exports.
The export of crabs and shrimp constitute more than 30 per cent of Canada’s trade with Thailand.
Viet Nam Viet Nam is ruled by a one-party communist state has moved recently to adopt free(r) market policies.
In July 2000, the first stock market in Viet Nam was opened.
The World Trade Organization hopes
that Viet Nam will accede on schedule in 2005 but significant additional reforms still need to be undertaken.
The reforms that have been enacted so far have undoubtedly helped the country achieve the highest real GDP per capita growth rate in the region.
Much like Thailand, rural poverty is rampant and relies primarily on subsistence farming.
Leading exports to Viet Nam by Canada are almost identical in composition as those to Thailand.
With a liberalizing economy, a larger population, and faster economic growth than Thailand, agri-food and seafood exports to Viet Nam could see large gains.
There are a couple of interesting points.
First, the trends in overall trade versus agri-food trade are completely opposite: in total trade, relative imports are rising while relative exports remain constant, while in agrifood trade, the opposite is true.
Second, intra-ASEAN trade is rising more quickly for agri-food and seafood products than for overall trade.
This may be an indicator that tariff-reducing exercises are increasing regional trade flows, as tariffs and non-tariff barriers are usually higher on agricultural products than other commodity classifications.
Direction of ASEAN Trade Flows 1993 1997 2001 Overall Intra-ASEAN (Imports) 17.4% 18.2% 20.8% Intra-ASEAN (Exports) 21.1% 24.9% 22.7% Intra-ASEAN (Total) 19.2% 21.5% 21.9% Agri-Food & Seafood Intra-ASEAN (Imports) 24.0% 21.8% 22.9% Intra-ASEAN (Exports) 14.7% 21.0% 21.6% Intra-ASEAN (Total) 18.0% 21.3% 22.1% Source:

These numbers are the combined imports and exports reported by six ASEAN members (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) to the then-current ASEAN members.
Thus, there is upward bias in the numbers as the date progresses.
Also, agri-food and seafood is defined simply as the first 24 HS chapters.
Because of common linkages, such as former colonial bonds and similar organizational frameworks, a greater partnership between ASEAN and the EU may have been expected.
Today, however, ASEAN is looking increasing westward as the member countries have realized their overall heavy dependence on Japanese goods and technology and would like to see greater diversification of external suppliers.
For total merchandise Total Value $2.691 bil $2.276 bil exports, the ASEAN region has Share 1.03% 0.60% been a declining region, both Agri-Food Value $0.332 bil $0.506 bil in nominal and relative terms, Share 1.61% 1.76% as displayed in table 20.
ASEAN is a larger market for Canadian agri-food and seafood exports than for any single European nation.
Edward Elgar:
Cheltenham, UK: 1999.
Canada’s largest exports to the region are outlined in table 21.
Half of trade with the region is composed of wheat.
The other leading products are similarly unprocessed products with little value-added.
Much of this can simply be attributed to low incomes and therefore low demand for high-value products.
As the region develops, however, there should be increased demand for more Canadian agri-food and seafood products, especially high-value ones.
Agri-Food Past, Present & Future Report Philippines January 2007
Philippines Country Report:
Philippines Past, Present & Future Report January 2007 Overview The Philippines, home to almost 88 million residents, is located in the heart of the rapidly developing Southeast Asian region.
Having been under American control from 1898 to 1946, this influence has transformed the Philippines into the most westernized country in the region.
The country boasts a growing consumer market that has developed a strong penchant for North American foods, and ultimately presents great opportunity for Canadian agri-food exporters.
The Philippines has an expanding under-30 population that is increasingly leading a westernized lifestyle, with a growing taste for North American-type packaged, processed and convenience foods.
This nearly 21 million-strong consumer group may become an extremely lucrative target market for Canadian agri-food exporters in the future.
Canada – Philippines Relations Canada and the Philippines maintain excellent bilateral relations.
Canada has provided monetary aid since the mid-1970s and enjoys a strengthening trade relationship with the country that averages $1 billion annually.
Canada has given more than $500 million in development support to the Philippines to date, and continues to donate approximately $25 million each year.
The nations first established diplomatic relations in 1972 and continue to maintain frequent highranking official visits to each other’s states.
The countries currently share trade, development, educational and cultural partnerships.
The Philippines is Canada’s 38th major export market and 36th Philippines Total Trade US$102.8 billion largest source for Canadian Exports US$49.6 billion Imports US$53.2 billion imports.
• Top Canadian exports to the Philippines include copper ores Canada-Philippines Ag Trade $159.4 million and concentrates (18%), meslin Exports $104.6 million and wheat (12%), and lumber Imports $54.8 million (11%).
Agricultural Trade Total agricultural trade between Canada and the Philippines has fluctuated over the past several years, but overall, decreased by 44% from $196 million in 2000 to $159 million in 2005 due to a reduction in Canadian exports.
Bulk and consumer-oriented goods consistently represent the majority of Canadian agri-food exports to the Philippines.
Such goods comprised almost all Canadian agri-food exports in 2005 at 85%.
Canada’s agricultural exports to the Philippines decreased by 44% between 2004 and 2005 mainly due to a large decrease in bulk exports.
Canada currently accounts for 1.7% of the Philippines’ total agri-food imports and is the Philippines’ 14th largest import source for such goods.
Canada’s agri-food imports from the Philippines have steadily increased over the past few years from $48.8 million in 2003 to $52.9 million in 2004, and $54.8 million in 2005.
This rise was largely due to increases in fruit juice mixtures and coconut oil imports between 2003 and 2004, and growth in fruit mixture imports between 2004 and 2005.
Complete statistical summary available at: http://ats.agr.gc.ca/stats/philippines_e.pdf
• Total Canada-Philippines agricultural trade represents approximately 13% or $159.4 billion of all trade between the two countries.
Top Canadian exports to the Philippines in 2005 were wheat totalling $43.4 million and representing approximately 42% of total agri-food exports, chicken and capon cuts at $8.6 million or 8% of total exports, and prepared or preserved potatoes worth over $7.7 million and 7% of exports.
Frozen swine cuts and malt accounted for roughly $5.4 million and $4.1 million respectively, or 5% and 4% of exports.
2005 bulk exports to the Philippines totalled $47.8 million, decreasing by 63% from $131.4 million in 2004, while intermediate exports totalled $15.5 million and showed about 29% growth from 2004.
Consumer oriented exports were valued at $41.2 million in 2005, a $2.2 million or 5% decrease from 2004.
Top Canadian imports from the Philippines in 2005 were dried coconuts valued at over $7.3 million and making up about 13% of all agri-food imports, garlic valued at over $7.2 million or 13% of total imports, and dried guavas, mangoes and mangosteens totalling almost $6.7 million or 12% of such goods.
Other major Canadian agri-food imports included pineapples and coconut oil, worth over $4 million and $2.5 million, or roughly 7% and 5% of total imports respectively.
Economy The Philippines has seen varied economic growth over the past 60 years, having experienced recessions (e.g. most recently the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis) and implemented numerous economy-boosting laws and reforms.
The country has recently made considerable progress in establishing economic stability, although fiscal and social problems remain two of the Philippines’ largest weaknesses.
In order to see sustained economic growth, the Filipino government must implement a high-growth strategy to address the country’s poverty issue.
A high population growth rate and unequal distribution of wealth throughout the country are major contributing factors to the Philippines’ ongoing struggle with poverty.
In fact, the National Capital Region (NCR), situated in Manila, alone is home to 14% of the population and generates one-third of total GDP.
Furthermore, 2001 per capita income in the NCR was estimated at almost nine times that of the poorest region of the Philippines.
Other challenges remain, including widespread corruption, little progress with core fiscal policies, the need for legal reforms, and rising energy prices.
However, the state plans to introduce continued economic reforms in order to help the Philippines remain competitive with the rest of developing Asia.
The government’s strategy includes improving infrastructure, boosting public revenues by strengthening tax collection, tightening fiscal spending, fostering privatization, improving banking sector viability, and increasing trade integration with the Asian region.
Such reforms are expected to counteract economic weaknesses and improve FDI to the Philippines.
The Philippines has drawn in over US$13.5 billion in FDI over the past decade in areas such as information technology, manufacturing, and telecommunications, as well as in service sectors like tourism, consulting, engineering and construction.
Foreign investment levels totalled US$1.1 billion in 2005.
As of July 2006, FDI levels had reached the 2005 year-end value, an approximate 60% increase over the same period in 2005.
The country also heavily relies on the remittances it receives from its estimated eight million overseas Filipino workers; foreign exchange payments equalled US$10.6 billion in 2005 or more than 10% of GDP.
Current economic trends:
Forecasted economic trends:
Inflation is expected to average 5% in 2007 and 2008, down from 6% in 2006.
As Filipinos increasingly lead busier lifestyles, demand for healthier packaged and processed foods is greatly increasing.
Filipinos also enjoy dining outside of the home on a regular basis, often frequenting take-away and fast food outlets, as well as reasonably priced full-service restaurants with family.
Therefore, major opportunities for Canadian agri-food exporters may include offering healthier portable, convenience, and ready-to-eat and -cook foods.
As is the case in many countries, traditional eating habits are modified as cultural and social changes surface.
With the Philippines having seen an influx of Westernstyle fast food chains and products (bolstered by Western lifestyles shown through media) consumers have trended toward purchasing more meals from such outlets and moving away from eating traditional Filipino dishes.
Healthier packaged and ready-to-eat foods, such as breakfast cereals, pasta, margarine and spreads have become increasingly popular.
Consumer expenditure totalled $75.6 billion in 2005, and is expected to rise approximately 27% to reach $96.3 billion by 2015.
Overall spending on less nutritious processed and packaged foods seems to be decreasing as consumers opt for healthier and more affordable value-added options.
Specific agri-food products that hold strong opportunities in the Philippines marketplace include powdered milk; green peas; fresh or dried potatoes, and potato flakes or powder; tomato paste or purée; and fresh, dried and mixed fruit.
Flavouring for ice cream, snack, canned and beverage products; dressings and spreads; cocoa-based products; and fats and oils are also expected to show considerable growth.
Due to extreme differences in the standard of living throughout the Philippines’ urban and rural areas, the following Filipino consumption analysis primarily reflects those consumers living in major urban areas of the country.
General
• Approximately 37% of consumer expenditure was allocated to the purchase of food and non-alcoholic beverages in 2005.
• In 2005, consumers spent $28.3 billion on food and non-alcoholic beverages.
This value is expected to increase by 31% to reach $37 billion by 2015.
• Roughly 15% of Filipinos (i.e. 13 million consumers) have enough income to purchase imported food and beverages on a regular basis.
This trend should yield significant long-term import growth if income distribution improves throughout the Philippines.
• More than 60% of the Filipino population (i.e. 52 million consumers) are under the age of 30; many of these urban residents are regular consumers of processed and ready-to-eat foods.
Dining outside of the home is becoming extremely popular with the Philippines’ urban residents, as such consumers increasingly lead busier lifestyles.
• Fish is the most popular fresh food in the Philippines, greatly due to its wide availability for most consumers.
Filipinos consumed an average 86 lb. per capita in 2003, a 6% increase over 1998 levels.
• Red meat remains a staple in most Filipino households despite its higher prices in comparison to poultry and fish.
Filipino consumers are quite price sensitive, and therefore tend to purchase food products that provide the best value for money.
Filipinos consumed an average 9.1 lb. per capita in 2003, a 15% increase over 1998 levels.
This fresh food sector saw 12% growth between 1998 and 2003 and obtained an average 79 lb. per capita consumption in 2003.
Growth in ready-to-drink (RTD) tea followed at 59% and 0.05 L per capita, and fruit and vegetable drinks with a 46% increase and 5.3 L per capita consumption.
Despite growing consumer interest in healthier beverages, carbonates remain the most popular soft drink among Filipinos with 35 L per capita consumption in 2003, a modest 1.4% increase over 1998 levels.
• Lager, white spirits and rum are the most consumed alcoholic drinks in the Philippines.
Combined, these sectors saw an average 133% growth between 1998 and 2003.
• Major supermarket chains operating in the Philippines include Supervalue Inc., SM Mart Inc., Robinsons Supermarket Corp., and Rustan Supermarkets Inc.
There are no internationally-owned supermarkets or hypermarkets in the Philippines.
Supervalue, Inc., SM Mart Inc., and Robinsons Supermarket Corp. target lower- to middle-class consumers who make up approximately 90% of the Filipino population.
Due to Filipinos’ price sensitivity and limited cold and/or freezer storage, products should be made available in smaller quantities, and packaging designed to resist extreme heat and humidity.
Fast food outlets, full-service restaurants, cafés, bars, home delivery and takeaway counters, self-service cafeterias, and food kiosks can all be found in major shopping malls in the Philippines.
In fact, such shopping centres have become more popular for their food retailers than for other shops on-site.
Fast food outlets account for 49% of the $4.1 billion (or 16% of consumer food expenditure) annually spent by consumers on food for consumption outside of the home.
Competitors As a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Philippines relies heavily on its many Asia-Pacific neighbours as import sources, making the country a more challenging market for Canadian products and companies to penetrate.
The Philippines’ principal agri-food import sources, United States (20%), Vietnam (16%), New Zealand (7%), Argentina (6%) and Thailand (6%), represent Canada’s top competition in the Philippines export market.
Other key competitors include Australia, China and European Union (EU) countries.
Access Issues The Philippines remains a destination of constant trade and investment interest for foreign investors, and holds strong potential for Canadian companies wanting to penetrate the Southeast Asian market.
To facilitate successful market entry, Canadian exporters are encouraged to develop market entry strategies that include working with local importers and distributors to develop a presence, gain valuable market advice, and best position products to meet local tastes, laws and pricing.
Logistics are a key consideration when looking to export to the Philippines.
Although the country continues to improve its infrastructure, many distribution networks, specifically roads in and around Manila, remain underdeveloped or highly congested.
The majority of the Philippines’ requirements governing imports are co-ordinated with WTO regulations, while others are specific to the region.
The Philippines does
hold several import regulations which Canadian exporters should be aware of before entering the market:
• Imported products typically face lower tariffs than those that compete with domestically produced goods.
The Value Added Tax (VAT) laws were amended in 2006, increasing the VAT rate to 12% from 10% and reducing VAT exemptions, in order to raise government revenues and in turn, eliminate the fiscal deficit.
It is recommended that Canadian exporters contact the Philippines’ Tariff Commission when checking import duties on individual products at http://www.tariffcommission.gov.ph/. The corporate income tax rate was raised to 35% from 32% in 2005, but is expected to decrease to 30% by 2009.
All bulk agricultural exports must have a sanitary certificate from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) or an appropriate agency.
Processed food and beverage exports need to be registered with the Philippine’s Bureau of Food and Drug.
For more detailed information on customs procedures, documentation, tariffs and labelling requirements consult the International Trade Canada – Trade Commissioner Service http://www.infoexport.gc.ca/ie-en/DisplayDocument.jsp?did=42842.
Business Travel Tips The Philippines’ business customs are similar to those in North America; however, a good understanding of the differences is important for successful market entry.
•
January 2007
The Philippines’ agriculture sector is an integral component of its economy, accounting for 14% of GDP and employing approximately 36% of the population in 2005.
The Philippines’ agricultural industry produced almost $19 billion of goods in 2005, a 5.6% increase over 2004 levels.
Agricultural growth is expected to slow through 2007, due to inclement weather that is forecast for the short term.
Crops accounted for approximately 47% of the 2005 agricultural output, and poultry and livestock comprised 15% and 13% respectively.
Arable land accounts for approximately 19% of total agricultural land, and permanent crops make up 17% of this land.
There are 15,500 sq. km of irrigated land in the Philippines.

Vietnam Past Present & Future Report January 2007 Overview Since Vietnam began its transition towards a market based economy its economic performance has been remarkable.
Over the past 5 years, Vietnam’s growth has been second only to China in the Asian region and many believe that growth could match or exceed China’s if infrastructure development and privatization keep up with economic expansion.
GDP growth is trickling down to the average consumer as average spending power has increased substantially.
Urban consumers have much higher levels of income and are increasingly looking to new retail outlets for new products that meet their evolving lifestyle.
Increasingly, Vietnam is turning to imports to address the growing needs of its ever expanding consumer base.
Canada - Vietnam Relations Canada - Vietnamese relations have been expanding considerably since diplomatic relations were formally established in 1973.
Since 1994, the Canada-Vietnam relationship has developed greatly due in part to a series of high level diplomatic missions by both countries.
This expanding relationship has led to significant increases in bilateral trade, facilitated by a bilateral trade agreement implemented in 1997, an Agreement on the Avoidance of Double Taxation, and an economic cooperation agreement.
Additionally, Vietnam and Canada are both members of La Francophonie which has allowed leaders from both countries to conduct less formal yet fruitful meetings.
Since 2000, bilateral trade between Canada and Vietnam increased from roughly $270 million to reach over $750 million in 2005.
Trade balance ($360 million)
• Canada’s imports from Vietnam were valued at $560 million in Canada - Vietnam Ag Trade 2005 up from $440 million in 2004 Exports $104.6 million Imports $154.4 million and $330 million 2003.
Trade balance ($49.8 million)
• Canada’s imports were comprised of primarily: fish and seafood, cashew nuts, coffee, wooden furniture, garments, footwear, woven apparel, spices, coffee and tea.
Agricultural Trade Traditionally, Vietnam had been a difficult agricultural market to access due to strict import regulations and high duties and tariffs.
However, this import situation, particularly involving agricultural goods, could improve to the benefit of imported consumer goods.
Vietnam is poised to join the WTO as early as the end of 2006.
In order to gain membership, Vietnam has already agreed to remove all agricultural export subsidies, implement a 30% reduction in tariffs over a five-year period and put an end to all export subsidies.
The key staples of the Vietnamese diet (fish and rice) are produced in abundance domestically and have naturally limited agricultural imports in the past.
However, the makeup of agricultural imports is changing as more affluent urban consumers seek more variety and convenience options.
In turn, the processing sector is looking to imports to supply this rapidly expanding industry.
In 2005, Vietnam imported US$3.7 billion worth of agricultural goods.
Vietnam’s primary agricultural import suppliers include China, Australia, Thailand, New Zealand, ASEAN countries, Argentina, the EU and the US.
Key agricultural imports for the consumer sector include dairy, tobacco and grain (wheat), while other major agricultural imports, such as fertilizer, animal feed and pesticides, support Vietnam’s significant agricultural sector.
This was an increase of more than US$70 million over 2003 levels.
Actual import totals continue to be difficult to accurately list as border and reporting issues continue.
Despite impressive growth in consumer-ready imports, bulk commodities continue to dominate the Vietnamese agricultural import market, a trend that will likely continue over the next five years due to three key factors.
• First, high value and processed goods are in very low demand throughout the country.
There are niche markets present, particularly in the country’s two key cities, but a majority of the population is still unable to afford processed or imported goods.
• Second, the government is working very hard to build a viable, modern food processing sector able to process the country’s vast ag-resources and imported bulk items for the domestic and regional market.
Given the country’s success in other ventures of this nature, it is fully expected that the it will succeed.
Vietnam Country Report:
Finally, despite significant growth and expansion in the retail sector, Vietnamese food purchases continue to be made in outdoor, informal wet markets.
Canada Vietnam Agricultural Trade Bilateral agricultural trade between Vietnam and Canada was valued at $259 million, over 40% of total trade.
This was an increase of $90 million over 2004 and $130 million over 2003 levels.
Canada exported $104 million worth of agricultural goods in 2005, an increase of $81 million over 2004 figures.
Canada’s agricultural exports are typically dominated by wheat and 2005 export growth was bolstered by a $69 million increase in wheat exports.
This increase has been carried through 2006 as wheat exports through August have already exceeded $66 million.
Growth in 2005 also came from significant increases in hide and skin exports which grew by more than $10 million over 2004, and seafood exports which increased by almost $3 million over the same period.
Vietnam Country Report:
Rates for 2005 and 2006 exceeded 8%, and 2007 and 2008 projections are in line with the period as a whole at 7.2% and 7.4% respectively.
Much of the country’s growth has come thanks to a rapidly expanding export sector.
Export growth since 1990 has exceeded China’s and Vietnam is now challenging even the most dominant countries in their "Bread and Butter" exports, such as with Brazil and coffee, India and tea, and Thailand and rice.
The truly remarkable aspect of this growth is the trickle down to the general population.
While Vietnam is still one of the Asia’s poorest countries, GDP PPP has tripled since 1990.
The percentage of the population that lives in deep poverty (less than US$1 per day according to the World Bank) has dropped from 50% of the population in 1990 to less than 10% to date.
Secondary school enrollment has doubled during the same period and today over 60% of appropriate aged children are enrolled in secondary school.
Life expectancy has jumped and infant mortality has plunged.
Statistics like these have demonstrated that over 15 years Vietnam has passed India, China and the Philippines in terms of percentages of population living out of poverty.
The country has better life expectancy and infant mortality rates than much richer countries like Thailand, and school enrollment is better than all of the above.
The Vietnamese economy has a number of notable strengths, such as key natural resources including oil reserves and an expanding educated workforce.
• FDI is growing at more than 30% GDP growth 8.4% (2005) 8% (2006e) per year, and is focused in the GDP/ capita US$550 industrial sector and services, particularly hotels and tourism.
• Ho Chi Minh City is the commercial centre of Vietnam.
Vietnam Country Report:
Overall, economic development has not been even.
Urban economies are much stronger than rural.
Urban PPP remains much higher than rural PPP.
Economic disparity is also visible on a province by province basis.
The government continues to be the country’s largest employer.
Industry contributes 41% of the country’s GDP and employs 37% of the labour force.
• GDP growth for 2007 and 2008 is expected to remain at the 7% average of the preceding 10 years.
• Long-term objectives include global economic integration through membership in APEC, ASEAN free trade and the WTO.
One million young Vietnamese enter the workforce every year and one million more Vietnamese move to the cities annually.
Serous issues could arise if jobs dry up.
Recently, Vietnam has benefited from high prices for its key commodities.
Serious drops in any of these categories could negatively affect future growth.
Both sectors are of high importance to the Vietnamese economy in terms of the work force and GDP, and it is unclear how they will perform without protection.
A regional slowdown or worse, an economic bust, would deeply impact this economy.
Privatization while reportedly at the top of the government’s plans for the future has seen politically motivated delays.
Currently only 5% of jobs are in private industry.
Over 70% of banking is controlled by Vietnam’s six state-owned banks and lending practices favour non-performing loans to state-owned enterprises.
Further improvements to the investment environment will be necessary if Vietnam is to become a prime destination for international investment dollars.
Current limitations to foreign ownership and a lack of transparency in internal deals have put off some investors.
•
Disposable income is increasing very quickly and income increases are not yet being erased by higher costs of living.
National per capita GDP is US$550 / GDP PPP is US$3,200.
Ho Chi Minh City is the commercial centre of Vietnam.
GDP growth rates in Ho Chi Minh City are 3% to 4% higher than the national average.
GDP / PPP in the Ho Chi Minh area is reportedly as high as US$9,000.
Modern retail outlets/supermarkets account for roughly 10% of food sales.
Consumers generally shop daily.
General preferences
• Fresh food is preferred and/or required due to daily food shopping habits and low levels of refrigerator ownership.
Fruit is an important component of the Vietnamese diet.
Pork has traditionally been the country’s meat of choice.
Issues with chicken safety have led to supply issues which have opened the door to beef.
While current sales have been limited to high-end consumers (e.g. hotels, restaurants, etc.) beef has been introduced to some of the larger local supermarkets.
Alcohol sales, in particular beer, are growing rapidly.
Vietnam has been described as a "snack-happy" society.
Since imported snacks are subject to some of the highest import rates, Western producers are moving toward domestic production to meet consumer needs and introduce new brands and products.
Consumer confidence in Western products is high and there has been a notable fascination amongst younger consumers with Western-styled goods.
Opportunities
• Dairy products (powder and fresh).
Imports are being targeted at general consumers and the processing industry.
Canada has had success in the past with powder exports.
Imported fresh and canned fruits are growing in popularity, particularly apples and grapes.
Competitors Vietnam’s Southeast Asian neighbours are the dominant food exporters in this market.
Their products are recognized, have the advantage of proximity and price and in some cases can avoid logistical issues by circumventing borders (illegally).
With regards to bulk products and processed goods commonly produced by Canada, competition comes chiefly from Australia and New Zealand.
The EU and the US have also established a strong presence in Vietnam.
Australia and New Zealand have focused a great deal of time and effort advertising and promoting their national foods in the region, in particular Vietnam, and have been rewarded.
In addition, the modern hotels and restaurants in Vietnam are dominated by Australian and European managers and chefs who have shown a preference for their home products.
Access Issues Overview With WTO accession on the horizon the access picture in Vietnam should improve considerably.
Processed goods face import tariffs from 20% to 50% while alcoholic beverages faces 65% import tariffs.
Food import requirements, particularly animal imports, can be lengthy and difficult.
January 2007
Foreigners are not permitted to import or distribute food in Vietnam.
Legal issues can be very complex, a local lawyer is considered essential.
Only 15 years ago Vietnam was a net importer of food, while today the country has become one of the world's largest exporters of rice and coffee.
Tea exports continue to rise and pepper, nuts and spices are all major international exports.
Even more impressive has been the recent performance of the fisheries industry.
Rice and coffee account for about half of agricultural export revenues.
The agricultural sector’s share of the overall economy continues to shrink in the face of the performance of the industrial sector; however, farmer harvests continue to grow and exports are on the rise.
The government has openly emphasized this great importance to the national economy of developing this sector.
Agriculture employs roughly 60% of Vietnam's workforce, farm products account for over 50% of the country's income, and 55% of all of its exports are related to the agricultural, fisheries or food processing industries.
Used and low cost machinery is common and there continues to be a demand for innovative, cost-effective production techniques which improve efficiency and productivity, but do not require large investments in capital equipment.
Many economists and policy makers seek solutions for Vietnam's rural sector where the overwhelming proportion of the population lives and works.
Crop diversification, rural industrialization, increased farm size, greater mechanization, application of science and technology, and diversification of crops are all ideas for greater growth and further poverty reduction in rural areas.
Food safety, both for domestic and export markets, is an increasingly important issue in Vietnam, but overall standards continue to lag behind Western levels.
Demand will increase for technologies in production, processing and storage facilities.

Economy- Overview Thailand is an industrializing country that has moved away from a traditional agrarian economy towards an export-oriented, service based economy.
However, the Thai economy still relies heavily upon agriculture as it consumes little foreign capital and contributes greatly to foreign earnings.
The Thai economy has experienced sustained growth between 3% and 4% over the past six years.
The IMF has backed the government of Thailand’s economic initiatives with a US$17.2 billion package.
The growth of the Thai economy has been tied directly to growth in exports.
In the period between 1997 and 2002 exports increased by 19.6% with the industry sector growing by 5.2%, services growing by 3.8%, and agriculture growing by 1.2%.
However, weak domestic demand between 1997 and 2002 forced the Thai government to reduce interest rates and run a low fiscal deficit.
Economy - Current Situation The solid GDP growth of 5.4% achieved in 2002 carried through into 2003 which achieved 6.7% for the year.
Industrial sector growth was fueled by growth in manufacturing and contributed 4.2 percentage points to GDP growth.
Stronger economic growth meant that the unemployment rate continued to fall.
After averaging 2.4% in 2002, it averaged 2.2% in 2003, the lowest rate since 1997.
However, the incidence of poverty remains a concern.
The Government is dealing with it through a fiscal spending program and an unemployment security fund to provide a safety net for those laid off.
The government has launched a "war on poverty" in an attempt to eradicate poverty within 6 years.
Faster economic expansion also strengthened the fiscal position from a deficit of 2.2% in 2002 to surplus of 0.6% in 2003.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose to 1.8% in 2003 from 0.7% in 2002, but remains manageable.
The core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, edged up by just 0.2%.
The monetary policy of the Bank of Thailand (BOT) is aimed at maintaining core inflation within a 0-3.5% range.
Thailand paid off the last of the IMF-arranged loan package in July 2003, 2 years ahead of schedule.
Soon after this, the Government announced that it would no longer borrow from multilateral sources.

30 years of age.
The importance of the Thai restaurant, hotel and catering services sector is growing.
Thailand is one of the top tourist destinations in the area.
High growth in the number of hotels, resorts and other tourist accommodations continues to lead to an increase in the number of imported food items to support more tourists.
Hotels and international restaurants play an important role in increasing consumer awareness about products, which may not be commonplace in the retail market.

Economy - Forecast GDP growth for all of 2004 is estimated at 7.2%, moderating in 2005 to just above 6%.
These numbers take into account any fallout from the Avian Flu outbreak.
Exports are likely to accelerate in 2004 assuming currency appreciation is held in check and assuming global economic conditions continue to improve.
Planned increases in government investment in 2004 and the government pledge to eliminate poverty should help to boost growth.
Growth in private consumption spending, a large factor in GDP growth for the past two years, should continue at 6% in 2004.
Farm incomes should increase with the higher prices of major crops.
Exports of electronics, plastics products, and vehicles have so far increased by 21% with imports of intermediate goods and raw materials increasing by roughly 25%.
Consumer Market Domestic spending and a rebound in exports bolstered the renewed growth that occurred in 2003.
Recently, Thai living in urban areas have become relatively brand conscious and their shopping behaviour has moved away from the traditional open-air wet markets to modern supermarkets and shopping centers which offer them convenience and a wide selection of products in a modern experience.
Changing eating habits of Thais are greatly benefitting the restaurant sector in Thailand.
Continuous increases in the number of health-conscious consumers is leading to higher demand for health and functional food and drinks.
Consumers are also eating out more frequently.
Upper and middle-income groups in Thailand like to spend money on food, especially during the holidays.
Consumption of imported food products
The products with the best sales potential are seafood, meats, nuts, baking products, breakfast cereals, canned foods, dairy products, fresh fruit and vegetables, frozen products, fruit juice, and alcoholic beverages.
Thailand has recently become a promising market for bull semen with imports valued in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Thai farmers are utilizing this import as an inexpensive way to upgrade the genetics of the existing domestic cattle herds.
The Thailand’s biotech policy mirrors that of Thailand's main trading partners Europe and Japan.
To keep in line with Japan and the EU, research is being conducted to reduce dependence on chemical pesticides, improve yield and reduce crop losses.
It is expected that future Thai decisions regarding biotech importation and production will continue to follow the standards set by Japan and the EU.
Thailand accounts for roughly 1% of total global trade.
Agriculture Thailand is a key regional agricultural producer with the capability to produce far more than it's population can consume.
As a result, the agri-food sector is a key component of international trade.
Thai agri-food exports exceed their imports by a broad margin.
Thailand's agri-food sector employs roughly 60% of the population.
The primary food crops produced are bananas, barley, cocoa beans, coconuts, coffee, maize, potatoes, rice, soybeans, sugar cane and wheat.
The primary livestock products are beef, chicken, duck, goose, lamb and pork.
Thailand is the world's largest exporter of rubber, canned pineapple and fresh orchids.
Thailand is also one of the world's largest seafood producers with valuable exports of frozen fish and shrimp.
However, 2004 anti-dumping tariffs on Thai shrimp entering the US will probably reduce Thai seafood exports in the coming months.
It is also estimated that Thai rice and tapioca account for 25% and 85% of world exports respectively.
The mining sector accounts for 3.8% of exports and 14.4% of imports.
Many of these countries are its major trade partners, accounting for more than 50% of total international trade value.
Thailand's foreign policy includes support for ASEAN in the interest of regional stability.
The country has developed increasingly close ties with other ASEAN members--Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Laos, Burma (Myanmar), and Vietnam.
Regional cooperation is progressing in economic, trade, banking, political, and cultural matters.
As part of its effort to increase international ties, Thailand has reached out to such regional organizations as the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
Hypermarkets, large supermarkets, have been hugely successful in Thailand.
Thailand features a growing retail industry which is looking for new imported food products.
To differentiate Canadian products from Thai products, firms should emphasize their strengths in quality, innovation, and safety.
It is recommended that all Canadian exporters visit the Thai market to conduct research, especially for product testing, price comparison, adjusting the product for local tastes and determining government regulations.
Canadian exporters must provide reliable product availability, consistently supplying a quality product, technical support, and information support.
Your business should match your export volume capabilities to the sale volume capabilities of the retail channel.
Product advertisement is very important in the Thai market.
In Thailand, advertising on television is the most popular and commands 64 %, newspapers 18%, radio 10%, magazine 5%, outdoor billboards 3%, and others 3%.
Thailand's high tariff structure remains a major market access impediment.
Even though the rates will decline by 33 to 50 % under the WTO, most items will remain in the 30 to 40 % range by the year 2005.
However, raw materials used in the food processing industry, which are not available locally, may be imported with low tariffs.
Market Access Distribution and sales of industrial goods in Thailand are normally conducted through two
proven to be a successful option for many foreign businesses.
In addition to high duties, other Thai policies continue to impose tough barriers on imports of products.
The Thai government has identified key areas of focus for future foreign investment.
The Thai agriculture industry is also currently seeking additional foreign investment.
Public investment declined in the first half of the year before recovering in the second, resulting in overall growth in total investment of 11.7%, approaching double the 6.5% recorded in 2002.
Semichemical wood pulp exports were at $27 million, up a strong 33% from 2002, while wheat exports to Thailand dropped to $21 million down 44% from 2002 The top five imports from Thailand to Canada are Computers at $204 million, up 30% from their 2002 levels.
Video and television equipment export values rose to $129 million, up a solid 7% with live crustacean imports decreasing 15% to $133 million.
Prepared crustaceans were exported at a value of $79 million, up 12% from 2002.

Agri-Food Past, Present & Future Report Singapore April 2007
Singapore Country Report:
Singapore Past, Present & Future Report April 2007 Overview Singapore is an island city-state with an exceptional infrastructure, stable political environment, and advanced economy.
Commercially and financially, Singapore is one of the most highly developed countries in the world.
The country is very prosperous and boasts a per capita GDP that is on par with Western Europe’s leading nations.
With limited space for large domestic production, Singapore is highly trade-dependent and possesses one of the busiest ports in the world, second only to Hong Kong.
Singapore also plays a significant role in Southeast Asia, acting as a major gateway to other countries in the area, and is the financial and technological center of the region.
The country’s 4.4 million consumer market has developed a strong penchant for North American foods, especially wholesome, organic and convenience food products.
This trend ultimately presents great opportunity for Canadian agri-food exporters looking to enter the Southeast Asian marketplace.
Canada-Singapore Relations Singapore is an active member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a strong advocate for regional growth and development, and a member of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).
Canada is a dialogue partner of ASEAN and has long been involved in development co-operation in the region.
Canada-ASEAN political and trade ties are quite strong.
Over the years, official development assistance from Canada to ASEAN countries has reached a total of $2.58 billion.
As one of APEC’s founding members, Canada is very active within the organization and has a history of promoting trade liberalization and facilitation initiatives.
Legal and regulatory systems are transparent, no equity is required to establish a business in Singapore, and there are little, or no, foreign ownership or control restrictions.
Foreign firms are present in nearly all economic sectors of Singapore, with the industrial sector largely dominated by foreign multinationals.
A significant amount of information sharing and
project collaboration occurs between Canada and Singapore in the areas of science, technology, and research and development (R&D).
Canada and Singapore are currently negotiating a bilateral free trade agreement.
This Imports $979.9 million Trade balance ($241.3 million) value increased by 6% from its 2005 Canada-Singapore Ag Trade $43.0 million total of $1.6 billion.
Exports $29.3 million
Agricultural Trade Although total agricultural trade between Canada and Singapore has fluctuated over the past several years, it has increased by 37%, from $31.3 million in 2000 to over $43 million in 2006.
Intermediate and consumer-oriented goods consistently represent the majority of Canada’s exports, comprising almost 80% of Canada’s agricultural and agri-food exports to Singapore in 2006.
These changes were largely due to increases in shelled cashew nuts and pasta imports between 2004 and 2005, and reductions in the same product imports between 2005 and 2006.
Pasta has remained Canada’s top import commodity from Singapore over the past decade and typically accounts for about 27% of total agri-food imports respectively.
Although Singapore is a large exporter, agriculture and agri-food comprises a small portion of its total exports due to the country’s small size and minimal agricultural industry.
Top Canadian exports to Singapore in 2006 were soya beans totalling $6.9 million and representing approximately 24% of total agri-food exports, wheat at $3.5 million or 12% of total exports, and prepared or preserved potatoes worth over $2.8 million and 9% of exports.
Frozen swine cuts and food preparations each accounted for roughly $1.4 million, or 5% of exports respectively.
2006 bulk exports to Singapore totalled $10.6 million, increasing by 34% from $7.9 million in 2005, while intermediate exports decreased to $4.6 million, a 242% decline from the 2005 value of $13.3 million.
Consumer oriented exports were valued at $13.6 million in 2006, an $800,000 or 5% decrease from 2005.
Singapore’s continual establishment of free trade agreements (FTA) are expected to further growth and create new opportunities for the country, as such accords improve market access and encourage foreign investment.
In order to maintain its market competitiveness and hold its position as a primary gateway to Southeast Asia, the Singaporean government continues to exercise an
Research and development has been cited a national priority with $3.8 billion planned to be spent in the area between 2006 and 2010.
Singapore has drawn in over US$82 billion in FDI over the past five years in such knowledge-based and hi-tech areas as information and communication technology, electronics, business and financial services, chemicals, biomedical sciences, logistics, other service sectors.
Foreign investment levels totalled US$9.3 billion in 2006 with more than 7,000 multinationals, mostly from the United States, Japan, United Kingdom, Germany and India, operating in the country.
• Singapore’s unemployment rate was approximately 3.6% in 2006.
• GDP growth is forecast to slow to 4.5% in 2007 from its 7.9% rate in 2006.
Consumer Market Singapore is labelled the culinary capital of the Southeast Asian region and eating is colourfully called a national pastime, presenting major opportunities for Canadian agrifood exporters.
Strong economic growth in recent years has increased consumer incomes and in turn bolstered the already successful Singaporean foodservice and retail sectors.
As Singaporeans increasingly lead busier lifestyles, traditional meal preparation and dining at home with family is commonly shifting to meals being enjoyed at restaurants.
Singapore’s "food paradise" boasts numerous foodservice outlets that
feature cuisine from around the world, making it simple for consumers to affordably dine outside of the home on a regular basis, often at least once a day.
In fact, due to their affordability, it is not uncommon to see families dine each evening at the nearest neighbourhood street kiosk.
Due to this overall trend toward health-consciousness, Singaporeans are now opting for more expensive organic foods.
This focus on health consciousness is expected to generate an increase in the number and popularity of organic foodservice outlets in Singapore in the future.
Home to a 660,000 Muslim population, the Singaporean market also holds considerable opportunity for halal food manufacturers.
Singapore’s Muslim consumers account for roughly 15% to 20% of total foodservice sales and engage in higher per capita spending than any other consumer group in the country.
As a result, more and more foodservice operators are obtaining halal certification in order to target this increasingly affluent and lucrative consumer segment.
Many of such outlets are seeing an average 20% to 30% increase in sales upon receiving certification, and include food operators with Western, Thai, Korean, Japanese, Mediterranean and Turkish cuisines.
This may present considerable opportunity for Canadian halal food exporters looking to enter the Singaporean market and/or further expand their business into other neighbouring Muslim markets such as the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia.
Consumer expenditure totalled $51.3 billion in 2005, and is expected to rise approximately 37% to reach $70.5 billion by 2015.
Overall spending on less nutritious food and beverages seems to be decreasing as consumers become more health conscious, with healthier food options making up the bulk of such goods being purchased.
A decrease in the consumption of carbonated soft drinks, canned meat and meat products, and margarine in recent years of 15%, 18% and 12% respectively exemplifies this trend.
Specific agri-food products that hold strong opportunities in the Singaporean marketplace include high-quality ready-made meals and frozen foods (e.g. seasoned meats and poultry dishes); diced vegetables; fresh fruit; soup; tree nuts; dairy products; fruit and vegetable juices; chilled and shelf-stable desserts, and ice cream; biscuits and sweet and savoury snacks; and pet food.
In 2005, consumers spent $6.4 billion on food and non-alcoholic beverages.
This value is expected to increase by 11% to reach $7.1 billion by 2015.
Approximately 58% of total food expenditure goes toward food for consumption outside of the home, reflecting the popularity of dining from a wide selection of world cuisines.
As Singapore’s residents increasingly lead busier lifestyles, the demand for safe processed foods and convenience products, as well as healthy and organic foods is rising.
• Fish is widely consumed in Singapore with consumption averaging 158 lb. per capita in 2003, a 17% increase over 1998 levels.
Fish and seafood consumption is expected to continue to show large gains as consumers opt for healthier foods.
Red meat is the most popular meat in Singapore with an average 23 lb. per capita consumed in 2003.
However, poultry, particularly chicken, is becoming increasingly popular with an average 17 lb. per capita consumed in 2003, a 26% increase over 1998 levels.
Eggs are also popular in Singapore with approximately 228 units per capita consumed in 2003, a 5% increase over 1998 levels.
With a push for healthier foods, consumption of vegetables has greatly increased in recent years.
Between 1998 and 2003, per capita consumption of green vegetables rose by almost 16% to reach 160 lb. per capita, and the popularity of tomatoes grew 20% to 50 lb. per capita.
Growth in fruit and vegetable juice followed at 44% and 16 L per capita, bottled water at 39% and 7.9 L per capita, and functional drinks with a 22% increase and 3.3 L per capita consumption.
Retail
• Singapore’s residents typically shop once a week at supermarkets for groceries, and visit convenience stores and small, independent retailers in-between weekly grocery orders.
However, open markets are still common for daily fruit and vegetable purchases at lower prices.
Major supermarket chains operating in Singapore include Carrefour, Giant, Cold Storage, NTUC Fair Price, and Shop N Save.
Supermarkets are increasingly offering 24-hour shopping in response to Singaporeans leading busier lifestyles and their need for more flexible shopping times.
Furthermore, consumers are willing to pay more for such added convenience.
Full-service restaurants account for 43% of the $3.7 billion (or 25% of consumer food expenditure) annually spent by consumers on food for consumption outside of the home.
Competitors As an APEC and ASEAN member, Singapore relies heavily on its many association partners as import sources, making the territory a more challenging market for Canadian products and companies to penetrate.
Singapore’s principal agri-food import sources, Malaysia (18.7%), France (11.6%), Australia (9.2%), Indonesia (8.1%) and China (8.1%), represent Canada’s top competition in the Singaporean export market.
To facilitate successful market entry, Canadian exporters are encouraged to develop market entry strategies that include working with local importers and distributors to develop a presence, gain valuable market advice, and best position products to meet local tastes, laws and pricing.
Singapore’s excellent infrastructure makes the country an attractive export destination for many foreign exporters.
The nation boasts a strategic location at the centre of international shipping routes, and acts as a major trans-shipment point to other Southeast Asian markets.
The country’s roadways also connect to neighbouring markets Malaysia and Thailand.
Home to a world-class port system, one of the leading cargo airports, well-developed highway and transit systems, and advanced IT and telecommunication sectors, Singapore remains one of the best connected countries worldwide.
In addition, the more than 3,000 logistics and supply-chain-management (SCM) companies operating in the country further facilitate the logistics of exporting to Singapore.
In addition to the WTO, APEC and ASEAN, Singapore is member of the UN and Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC), and implements international accords and policies from these bodies.
• Singapore is virtually a duty-free port and does not apply tariffs or quotas to food commodities.
However, taxes on liquor, tobacco and tobacco products do apply.
It is recommended that Canadian exporters contact Singapore Customs when checking import duties on such individual products at www.customs.gov.sg.
• A customs permit is also required from Singapore Customs for each shipment of food products.
Exporters can apply for the permit via the customs authority’s TradeNet System.
Approximately 99% of customs permits are approved through this system within 48 hours.
• A 5% goods and service tax (GST) rate is applied on the costs, insurance and freight (CIF) of all imported agri-food products and beverages.
• The Food Control Division (FCD) of the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) oversees food safety, licensing, inspection and import control.
Processed food and beverage exports to Singapore need to be registered with the FCD.
• Singaporeans prefer to first develop a personal relationship on which to later build a business connection.
Singaporeans are, however, more formal than Canadians and typically use their family names during introductions.
Note that many Chinese Singaporeans have a European and Chinese name (with the Chinese name following the surname), e.g. Andrew Tan Yew Meng, but usually only use their family names during introductions (e.g. Mr. Tan).
Accept and offer business cards with both hands, and make sure to study them for a few seconds before putting them carefully away.
Note that approximately 77% of Singapore’s population is Chinese, 14% Malaysian, and 7% Indian, and each of these segments maintains their respective culture and customs.
Furthermore, the country’s Muslim population abstains from eating pork or drinking alcohol, and strict Buddhists and Hindus do not eat beef.
English and Mandarin are widely spoken, with English considered the language of administration and international business in Singapore.
Malay and Tamil are also common in Singapore.
Singaporeans do not always bring up problems or negative responses in conversation as it may "offend".
Therefore, one should pay careful attention to their counterparts’ body language as they may not openly express their concerns.
Private sector business hours generally run from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday, and 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Saturday.
Furthermore, with arable land only accounting for a mere 1.47% of total agricultural land, and permanent crops comprising this entire amount, the country’s agricultural sector is essentially nonexistent.

Market Overview Vietnam's stable growth over the past decade has had a positive impact on consumer spending power, resulting in nascent demand for imported and non-traditional agri-food products.
A new emerging class of higher-income, younger and more westernized consumers is readily apparent.
Food distribution patterns are also changing, with supermarkets expanding in the urban areas.
At the same time, Vietnam will remain interested in imported commodities, including wheat and canola.
Vietnam imported about $628 million(1) of food and beverages in 2001, mostly from the EU, New Zealand, Australia, China and the United States.
The total market size of imported agri products in Vietnam is estimated at $1.41 billion (2000) and $2.04 billion (2001).
Opportunities While local produce tends to be competitive and of good quality, Vietnamese processed foods are generally of a lower standard.
There is increasing investment in domestic production of foreign-branded items.
Processed food items originate from all over the world, and achieve success due to a number of factors: price, brand identification, and store promotions.

Key Participants Vietnam produces the majority of its daily food requirements.
Dairy products are dominated by France (joint-venture production), New Zealand and Australia (low-cost imports).
Beer is mostly local JV production, including brands from Singapore, Philippines, Denmark and Netherlands; imports are highly taxed, although there is some tariff concession with the U.S. Bilateral Trade Agreement.
The bottled water market is dominated by local production, much of it foreign-invested.
The limited market for frozen or chilled meat (mostly beef or lamb) is dominated by New Zealand and Australia.
Other processed foods can be found from all over the world, including Asia, Europe and elsewhere.
Private- And Public-Sector Customers The local supermarket chains (Saigon Co-op, Maximark, Citimart, Metro Cash & Carry) and trading firms are the major importers.
Market Access Considerations Vietnam is a country that is undergoing a significant transition toward a modern market economy.
However, the market is still limited by a number of factors, such as:
• tariff rates that are high even by regional standards, for processed food and beverage products, notably for those products where there is local production;
• a price-competitive environment for most products;
• a consumer market that is susceptible to intense marketing (Vietnam has high television penetration, but promotion is difficult due to a lack of market size for many products); and
• a lack of familiarity with some products in which Canadian processing is particularly strong (outlets such as fast food franchises are very limited).
Shipping costs to Vietnam are higher than to other countries in the region, and are a particular impediment for Canadian products.
Vietnam has applied for the World Trade Organization (WTO), and Canada has initiated bilateral discussions toward reducing and binding some food tariffs.
Canada is one of the few countries to have finalized arrangements for veterinary certification for several livestock and meat products (in 2002).

Executive Summary The following report is an analysis of the demand for slaughter line and meat processing equipment in Vietnam.
As well, upstream supply lines, from feed to farms, are moving from household production to an agro-industrial model with corresponding increases in efficiency.
Interviews with executives in the Red River Delta and the Mekong Delta regions revealed that current and planned equipment investments are estimated at approximately $106.3 million (USD$70 million).
This investment only includes interviewed firms, indicating that the market is in fact much larger.
The demand for equipment ranges is split between smaller, lower volume equipment and turnkey facilities to fully and semi-automated sub-production lines (slaughter line to value-added processing) There is also strong demand for packaging equipment.
Most interviewed firms have clearly defined growth plans, largely based on internal capital resources or substantial equity with financing.
It remains to be determined if these plans are going to be effective, especially to meet international production standards.
Nevertheless, the new industry catch-words are "standards and hygiene."
Some of this is focused on interest in overseas markets with phyto-sanitary standards rather than on Vietnam's market.
This significant investment is in response to the limited production capacity of slaughter line and meat processing firms and the rising consumption of fresh meat and processed meat products.
The background to these investment plans is the increase in the consumption of meat in from 17.9 kg to 22.5 kg per capita/year from 1995 to 1999.
Recent estimates place current consumption at 25 kg per capita/year.
Government forecasts estimate consumption will rise to 35 kg by 2010(1).
This significant potential demand should be qualified by the fact that questionable statistical gathering methods in Vietnam and the necessity for a conservative reading of the market.
Nevertheless, rising retail prices for pork are indicative of the growing demand.
Government policies strongly encourage investment in agro-processing technology, with access to subsidized loans or loan guarantees.
The specific investment outlays have yet to be determined for this program although interviewed executives stated that access to this investment capital will be competitive and based on market principles.
These policies are also supported by pork export incentive programs.
Furthermore, Vietnamese firms will face domestic competitive pressure in 2006 when the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement enters into force and import taxes on processed meat products falls from 20-30% to 5%.
A stable competitive equipment market with defined firm market share has not yet developed; nevertheless, competition is increasing and gaining a foothold in the market will require determined efforts on the part of Canadian slaughter line and meat processing equipment manufacturers.
Regional and international firms who have already entered this market are now focusing on consolidation of existing markets, and expansion to take advantage of the significant opportunities.
Market Overview Introduction:
Emerging Market Demand The meat processing sector (primarily pork) is entering a period that can be characterized as an emerging market - firms are beginning to make substantial investments in production technology.
The growth in domestic consumption markets and expanding export markets have reached a level that calls for more substantial capital investment.
Mechanized processing equipment is non-existent (primarily manual slaughtering), or not reliable nor efficient, and production sub-processes are not efficiently engineered.
Initial investments in the late 1990s for freezer lines, and a few stand-alone machines (such as de-hairing) are worn out, or of low production capacity.
More importantly, most firms are undergoing a transition from manual to mechanized production.
The focus of the majority of interviewed executives is to improve slaughter line production standards and consolidate current markets, and to further expand into value-added meat products (sausages and cooked meats), and other types of meat processing (chicken and beef).
There is awareness that entire production processes need to be re-engineered, focusing on key hygiene requirements.
Demand is high for international standard production equipment and food technology engineering, complete with service and maintenance.
This demand for quality and service is in response to the poor performance of foreign rebuilt or inexpensive equipment, purchased during the early to mid-1990s.(3)
The ongoing expansion of retail outlets, supermarkets and fast food franchises are also fueling the demand for processed meats.
As well, consumption of local food products is growing with the surge of foreign tourism arrivals.
Industry executives are getting to know the most important factors for accessing export markets.
Most firms are aware of the necessity to strive towards international standards and significantly improve production processes.
"Standards and Hygiene" are becoming the new industry catch-words.
Growth in exports continues to be limited by the lack of stable veterinary Treaties or other agreements that act as barriers for exports.
Russia is the only country having full veterinary treaty status with Vietnam.
Canada has recently agreed on veterinary certificates for nine meat and livestock products, but the focus of these agreements was more to secure access to Canadian genetic material, rather than to establish market access for Vietnamese products in the Canadian market (a much longer-term proposition).
Specific Growth Plans of Vietnamese companies Most local companies have clearly defined growth plans, largely based on internal capital resources or substantial equity with financing.
Considering these companies' current revenues, as well as the very low cost of production, capital is available for investing in equipment.
Overview:
The Structure Of The Meat Processing Sector Structure According to industry analysts, there are approximately 290 slaughterhouses in Vietnam.
The majority of these firms are present or former state companies and many of these firms are not market competitive.
A significant number of these firms are perishing or are likely to perish as more efficient firms responding to market forces, overtake take their present minor market share, and state subsidies become less available due to competitive market forces for investment capital(5).
Regulatory standards have yet to influence the structure of this sector.
The competitive meat processing industry can be divided into four levels based on volume of production, management sophistication and relative geographic coverage and span:
A first level is made of three major, state-owned integrated firms:
• Ha Long Canned Foods Joint Stock Listed Company; and
These companies own a combination of slaughterhouses, processing plants, and refrigeration facilities in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Danang and Haiphong (the latter only for Ha Long Canned Foods).
VISSAN is the only company that is fully integrated from feedlots to retail outlets.
It has been stated that Animex plants are of the few plants in Vietnam that comply with international hygiene standards (only three of the total in Vietnam meet international standards,(6) although this could not be verified during the field research activities.(7)) These three firms employ upwards of 1000 employees each.
Markets are both domestic and export.
Production at each is above 50,000 tonnes per year.
The second level of companies is made up of firms producing between 5000 and 50,000 tonnes per year.
The third level is made up of approximately 20 to 30 slaughterhouse and meat processing firms.
These firms are predominantly focused on slaughter and freeze, and more recently pig farming to lock in supply lines.
Downstream value added is just beginning, such as cooked and sliced pork for the retail market.
These companies are concentrated in:
• The City of Haiphong and the surrounding Red River Delta provinces; and
• HCMC and surrounding region.
These firms employ on average between 100 and 200 employees.
An important factor to note is that according to industry executives, there are more firms than are widely known but these firms operate as trading companies.
These second tier firms produce from 1000 to 5000 tonnes per year for both the domestic (especially wholesale), and export markets.
According to industry analysts, the firms in the fourth tier number "in the hundreds".
These firms are involved in a much broader range of activities, from slaughtering to value-added production such as processed and fresh cooked meats for almost exclusively, local markets.
The city of Haiphong alone was stated as having over 20 small companies involved in these activities(9).
These firms are best characterized as family businesses.
Most of these firms produce well below 1000 tonnes per year, while value-added processing firms produce less than 10 tonnes per year.
Meat Processing Equipment Lines According to factory research and inspection, mechanized slaughter line meat processing equipment is evident in the stages of production noted below.
It should be noted that the majority of this equipment is old, of low productivity and in need of upgrading, with the exception of new meat processing firms catering to the high income market(10).
The majority of these firm's production processes or equipment do not meet international equipment standards for certification(11).
The following table is to provide a general picture of the equipment lines.

Production Process Development Once again, there is significant demand for slaughter line and meat processing equipment, as well as well as the capital to pay for it.
Improved technology is the key to overcoming the current constraints.
Currently, the industry is characterized as being unhygienic, from animal slaughtering, to meat processing and the meat distribution system.
These executives are also getting to know the correct equation for the growth and development of their firms, and general opportunities and challenges in the sector.
BLCA field interview
Future Processing Equipment Growth Specific investment projects are divided to the scale of production.
With the exception of VISSAN, most investment focuses on semi-mechanization.
These range from full-scale turnkey packages to single item units, such as a small sausage machine.
The growth is divided between scale and production processes.
Big scale - Turnkey Packages for Factory production
• Modest investment of $1.5 million (USD$1 million) to large multi-plant investments of $60.7 million (USD$40 million).
• There is the significant potential for turnkey packages.
The market for this equipment is limited to the top tier producers.
Medium to Small Scale - Production Sub-Process Equipment:
Medium to small-scale production processes are primarily targeted at firms producing upwards of 5000 tonnes per year(13).
These companies are characterized by a relative lack of awareness in available technology, although capital is not regarded as an impediment.
This reflects the market as being "early stage", as well as the limited numbers of technical exchanges following Vietnam's diplomatic isolation (the US embargo only being lifted in 1995), former reliance on East Bloc technology, and former lack of resources.
The following equipment is needed:
• Kill Floor Equipment: potential CO2 or stunning equipment, mechanical moving equipment;
• Mechanical de-hairing machinery, scalding, wash and animal preparation equipment (hygiene) prior to slaughtering;
• Conveyors and cutting line technology;
• Secondary processing technology such as grinders, mixers, blenders and moving equipment;
• Hygiene and safety systems;
• Value added processes such as smokehouse technology, sausage making machines and others.
• Chicken and beef processing equipment.
Small Scale - Stand-Alone Equipment There is a broad demand for small-scale stand-alone equipment.
The critical factor for demand for this equipment is the price level for different production processes.
Stated needs are for small cutters, grinders and mixers, sausage making machinery and other processed meats.
This market is very difficult to aggregate with accuracy.
To determine the demand for equipment would clearly require more comprehensive equipment and market research.
Specific Investment Projects Due to the brevity of analysis, not all firms' investment plans are listed.
Given the general demand in the industry, most firms are currently looking at new equipment, or will be in the near future.
Interviewed firm executives stated the following list.
Company Investment Potential (USD) Equipment Haiphong Food Processing 1-3 million Expand production to include beef slaughter and processing, improve existing slaughter line technology, expand to value added production with a capacity of 3 to 5 tons/day.
Pressing investment concern.
Background To The Demand For Meat Processing Equipment Domestic Consumption Demand Increasing economic prosperity in Vietnam has a direct relationship to the growth in food consumption and correspondingly demands for meat processing.
Average annual meat consumption per capita increased approximately from 17.9 kg to 22.5 kg from 1995 to 1999.
(Accurate and unbiased statistics are notoriously difficult to obtain in Vietnam; almost certainly the consumption rates have been increasing by 10% per annum since then).
The share of commercial feed consumption has increased from 1% to 27% in the same period of time.
The demand for commercial feed is increasing, while prices are falling; an important indicator that markets are becoming more efficient.
Foreign investment has been coming into this sector and this growth in animal feed is anticipated to continue as current demand is approximately 2-3 million tons/year while supply is limited to only 1.5 million tons/year.
Danish Embassy, 2001
Increasing supply of meat, especially pork Overall, the meat industry is currently outputting from 1.7 to 1.9 million tonnes per year: 77% pork, 16% poultry and 7% cattle and buffalo.
As well, the off- take rate has increased by close to 7% annually.
At 5.9%, the growth rate was faster in the first half of the decade (1990-1994), compared to 3.5% from 1995-1998.
Animal weight has increased from 59 kg to 68 kg/head.
The number of buffalo, which are primarily used as draught animals, are declining.
Cattle herds stand at 4 million head in total, 40% of which are used for work.
Herd and the annual off-take (measured in live weight) have grown at 5-6 % since 1990.
Since 1995, the annual growth rate has slowed to 3%.
Most farms are small, having five animals or less.
Southern Vietnam has most of the large farms and high quality pigs in Vietnam.
Five percent of pig herds are being reared on an agro-industrial model, having genetically improved varieties and commercial feeds.
The second grouping of farms that produce 10% of the national herd(18) are mid-sized farms with approximately 100 pigs.
These farms are in the process of switching to agro-industrial models and in the near future will be a significant engine for the growth of supply.
Seventy percent of pork is sold fresh onto the market and the remaining 30% is processed.
Several processing firms also stated that they would like to import frozen Canadian pork.
The main obstacle for increasing exports, after high production costs, is the lack of bilateral veterinary agreements.
Russia (CIS) is the only country with bilateral veterinary treaties.
China, Malaysia, the Republic of Korea and Japan have only issued temporary licenses.
In general, another obstacle is the lack of export finance facilities available to companies, either from government sources or from commercial banks.
Government Policies Encouraging Signs The most common complaint among firm executives was the lack of pro-active government policies to encourage the animal husbandry and meat processing sectors.
This attitude began to change in 2001 as new policies focused on the agro-processing industry were passed:
• On 2 January 2001, the Prime Minister of Vietnam has signed the Decision No. 02/2001/QD-TTg to provide policies for financial assistance to the agro-processing sector.
According to this Decision, agro-processing firms may get up to 90% of total investment from the Development Assistance Fund (DAF).
DAF also provides guaranty of 100% loan value to these firms in case they can get loans or financing from other sources.
• Decision 133/2001/QD-TTg dated 10 September 2001 of the Prime Minister also gives the green light for agro-processing firms to obtain loans.
However, interviewed companies stated that it is difficult to get funding from DAF.
Funding is determined by provincial People's Committees and shared by different agro-processing sectors, dominated by state-controlled enterprises, regardless of the registration.
Overall, DAF is made available to less than 15% of private sector companies in Vietnam, although this accounts for most exports and job growth.
Meat processing companies stated that their preference is other sources of funding, usually "grey market" financing, although commercial banks are becoming more and more active.
The Government of Vietnam has also created incentives to encourage investment and development in agro-processing sector.
Resolution No. 6-NQ/TW dated 10 November 1998, the Government listed livestock breeding as an official production sector in the nation's economy.
This decision will have far-reaching effects as the formal recognition of the sector shall provide the foundation for cross ministerial policy platforms and program activities.
Most recently, the Ministry of Finance's Decision 65/2001/QD-BTC, dated 29 June 2001, provides an incentive bonus for the export of pork at VND 900 (Cdn$ equivalent?) per $1.00 worth of export.
There are a number of other legal documents giving incentives to livestock breeding and processing.
Meat processing equipment, according to the Ministry of Finance, is subject to a 3% to 5%. import tax.
Tax on equipment for special projects can be waived.
Nevertheless, all equipment is subject to a 5% to a 10% VAT (GST), although this needs to be confirmed on a case by case basis.
Depending on the region, there may be other tax incentives that could apply to meat processors, such as the remote area incentives or other incentives.
As the deadline for implementation of tariff reductions as part of the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA) draws closer, Vietnam will be seriously challenged to maintain and develop its domestic production for processed meats.
The current tax on imported processed meat products ranges from 20% to 30%, of which pork products have the highest tax.
After the AFTA treaty is in force in 2006, the tax for processed meat will only be 5%.
The potential impact of the BTA and WTO treaties are less easy to predict, although many countries will reserve pre-accession negotiations for commodities such as pork and beef.
The local companies interviewed were well aware of the changing environment, although there is no national association for the sector.
In-country representation has proven to be the most effective way to sell equipment in Vietnam.
Vietnamese consumers like "tangible" evidence of manufacturers' commitment to the market, and want to be able to contact them quickly and easily in the event that there are technical issues (after-sales service and training are increasingly important sales factors).
In-country representatives can better understand business customs and regulations, to structure equipment sale arrangement more efficiently and cost-effectively.
They are also more able to assist customers in lobbying for soft loan, customs procedures, delivery tracking, etc.
Vietnam is a developing economy, and still qualifies for concessionary loans and grants from a number of bilateral and multilateral sources, many of which are used by manufacturers of the same country of origin.
Marketing and Promotion The most effective way to promote equipment is to participate in trade fairs, wherever possible, and to organize technical seminars with the participation of end-user companies, related ministries, and provincial authorities.
Follow up work after seminars should include meetings with the company decision-makers.
Ministry people are important in cases where firms are state owned.
Marketing materials need to be tailored to the local style and presented in the Vietnamese language.
Technical visits to equipment manufacturing sites or to-equipped-facilities are useful in providing a more direct marketing approach.
Equipment Sales Most equipment sales are done on a one to one basis between a dealership or representative and the individual firm's executives.
Relationship building is of the utmost importance.
Visited executives have stated that they have received sales people in the past but follow up contact has generally been poor and sporadic.
The request for catalogues during the research process speaks of the curiosity and the demand.
Site visits to Canada are very important and timely business visa processing is critical.
Several firm executives have stated that the difficulty in obtaining Canadian visas was taken as a sign that Canada (in general) is not interested in doing business.
This is a perception that needs to change, and change quickly, and recent changes to visa issuance through the Consulate-General of Canada in HCMC (from January 2003) will hopefully address some of the concerns (most importantly, quick turnaround).
Canadian companies wishing to facilitate Vietnamese visits to Canada should advise the commercial sections of the Embassy or Consulate-General as soon as they learn about prospective visits.
Purchases of large equipment in Vietnam, particularly through state-owned companies, are often arranged through tenders.
It is critical to get to know and work with customers before the tender documents are made and released to the public.
This is to ensure that the manufacturer's equipment specifications match the tender document specifications.
This takes patience and time.
Financial leasing is a potential source of funding that may have some potential in Vietnam, particularly as this sector becomes better known and as the sector becomes further liberalized as part of the US/Vietnam BTA.
Payment and Contracts Payment for imported equipment is generally done through letters of credit.
This is now a standard method in Vietnam.
Any concerns regarding Vietnamese issuing institutions can be addressed to the Canadian missions in Vietnam.
All contract details should be carefully analyzed, especially concerning warranties and replacement parts, payment systems and tax liabilities.
Relying on recourse to the law is not a suggested strategy as the Vietnamese judicial system is poorly developed and enforcement, particularly against state-owned companies, difficult.
Offshore arbitration is a common business practice between foreign and domestic parties who enter into serious business relationships; again, Vietnamese courts require enforcement.
The services of Export Development Canada and of the Canadian Commercial Corporation are available for Vietnam.
For further details, contact the Canadian missions in Vietnam.
The Competition For Slaughter Line And Meat Processing Equipment As the meat processing sector is in an emerging market period, there has yet to be the substantial development of competitive equipment markets having defined company market shares.
Strong demand is only now emerging and companies with a presence in Vietnam, either representative offices or dealership networks, will take the near future market share.
The Danish Embassy has focused effort on broadening Danish firm's access to the animal husbandry and meat processing markets.
This includes a recent market analysis of the Pig Meat Sector and efforts by their trade division to promote bilateral business relations include the mixed credit program (subsidized credit).
Two third-level meat processors (under 5000 tonnes per year) in northern Vietnam have recently completed plant upgrades with German equipment.
VISSAN executives have already spoken with Dutch, German, Italian and Spanish manufacturers regarding their 40 million dollar investment plans.
The competitive equipment market is divided into two categories: representative offices and agencies with local firms.
Representative offices most often deal with a broad range of food processing equipment and are focused on larger turnkey factories or more expensive sub-process equipment.
Equipment bearing the brand names of Seiderman, Cossini, and Mouler are currently sold in-country.
It is more difficult to identify and verify information on Vietnamese trading firms.
According to the people interviewed in this research, these trading firms appear to be opportunistic, rarely having exclusive dealership arrangements, and reluctant to divulge which equipment they are representing and selling for fear of having in-country competition.
This dealership relationship is a point to consider for market entry strategy for Canadian companies.
The Canadian missions in Vietnam can provide advice on individual companies, particularly if referred to by third parties.
A number of countries, such as Spain, the United States and the United Kingdom are increasingly focusing on commercial missions aimed at the growing food preparation and packaging sector.
The Canadian missions in Vietnam are interested in a similar technical seminar and mission planned for 2003.
Interested parties should contact the missions (contacts below).

Tuy Hoa Producing Agricultural And Fishery
1 Royal Danish Embassy - Danish Economic and Commercial Office (12/2001) The pig meat sector of Vietnam:
31; "When compared to the rest of the world, meat prices in Vietnam are still relatively high and not competitive, e.g., exported pork is quoted at US$ 750 per ton in Red River Delta and USD $900-1000 in the south, while U.S. companies sell leaner export products for US$600-700, and the Chinese for US$650 per ton." 3 Equipment was primarily imported from northern European countries.
4 These figures were provided by industry executives as well as analysis of published reports and marketing materials from 1999 to the present day.
It is standard practice for Vietnamese firms to under-report growth and expansion, and the tax and regulatory system has yet to enforce accounting standards.
5 Given the limited pool of investment capital and significant competition between processing firms whether provincial (state) food companies, private, joint venture or foreign firms, accessing subsidized (whether loan guarantees or low interest) state investment capital will be more difficult to justify as the downstream markets are competitive.
The biggest of these firms may process upwards of 200 90kg hogs per day at best.
Market Information Southeast Asia Bio-Industry - Sector Profile - Vietnam July 2003 The Canadian Embassy in Vietnam 31 Hung Vuong St. Hanoi, Vietnam Tel.: (011-84-4) 823-5500 Fax: (011-84-4) 823-5333 E-mail: hanoi-td@dfait-maeci.gc.ca Internet: www.infoexport.gc.ca/vn
Market Overview Biotechnology in Vietnam is a high priority for the government.
Research activities in government-own institutes are focused on molecular biology and genetic engineering; microbial biotechnology for the production of bioactive compounds, biofertilizers; environmental protection and soil remediation; enzyme biotechnology; plant biotechnology for in-vitro conservation; the propagation of superior germplasm (plant tissue culture for mass propagation of planting material for horticulture, fruit and forestry industries and for developing high yield plants); and animal biotechnology methods.
However, these research activities are heavily dependent on government funding or overseas development assistance (ODA) support.
To date, there has been little domestic or foreign investment in the sector.
The government has been developing standards for the industry, with a focus on developing regulations to control imports of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and genetically modified foods (GMF) and to improve food safety.
Opportunities Current priorities for biotechnology development in Vietnam focus on the agricultural and forestry sector.
A few laboratories have been built to conduct research on plant tissue technology for developing high yield crops and the propagation of plants for afforestation.
Vietnam imports modest amounts of laboratory and clinical equipment each year to support its research activities.
Canadian equipment has been reasonably successful.
Several projects are under way involving Canadian companies looking to improve the genetic stock of livestock in Vietnam, but these may be impacted by the BSE outbreak, despite a recent signature of Animal Health Protocol between the two countries for various animal products (including a certificate for exporting swine).
Market Access Considerations Although government interest is high, there is limited funding available to address the challenges that Vietnam faces in developing its agri-food sector.
Government revenues spent on this sector are less than $3.14 million(1) per annum, with the balance funded by ODA or the private sector.
Specifically, there are concerns regarding Vietnam's poor record in intellectual property protection, as well as shortages of qualified technical staff.
This limits the demand for biotechnology in the short term.
With limited expertise on the local market, interested exporters should look at partnering with a regional company that is likely to have better connections within Vietnam, and more interest in investment.
Key Participants Since rice is the dominant commodity in Vietnam's agricultural sector, holding position number 2 in exporting rice worldwide, it has received the most attention from the biotech industry.
Rice seed products from China and Taiwan dominate, and Korea and Japan have also been active.
Suppliers of laboratory equipment for biotech research are mainly from the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and Japan.

Market Information Southeast Asia The Powdered Segment of the Fruit Juice Industry* February 2005
Ronald Mark G. Omaña Researcher Center for Food and Agri Business University of Asia and the Pacific Juices enjoy wide exposure especially in supermarkets and groceries.
There are five types of juices sold in the market, namely: fruit juice; fruit juice from concentrate; fruit nectar; concentrated fruit juice; and dehydrated or powdered fruit juice.
The Food Safety Authority of Ireland describes the juice types as follows:
Table 1.
Juice Types and Description Fruit juice
• The extracted juice of fruit, which has not been concentrated.
Has a shelf life of "days"
• May not contain any artificial flavors, colors or additives other than carbon dioxide and acidifying agents Fruit juice from concentrate
• Juice which has been concentrated and returned to its original state by the addition of water Fruit nectar
• Obtained by adding water and sugar and/or honey to fruit juice, fruit juice from concentrate, concentrated fruit juice, dehydrated/powdered fruit juice, fruit puree or a mixture of these products Concentrated fruit juice
• Product obtained from fruit juice of one or more kinds by the physical removal of a specific proportion of the water content.
• It is necessary to dilute this product with water before consumption Dehydrated / Powdered fruit juice
• Product obtained from fruit juice of one or more kinds by the physical removal of virtually all the water content.
Food Safety Authority of Ireland (www.fsai.ie) Household spending on fruit juices and non-carbonated drinks (powdered, concentrated, and ready-to-drink) was estimated at P7.2 billion in 2000 from P5.1 billion in 1997 (National Statistics Office (NSO)- Family Income and Expenditure Survey).
In addition, there are several variants available in the market.
The Players The industry is dominated by two major players, namely, San Miguel Corporation subsidiary Philippine Beverage Partners Inc.
(PhilBev) and multinational firm Kraft Foods (Philippines) Inc.
Other players include large companies in the food and beverage industries such as Nestle Phils.
Inc., RFM Corporation, and Universal Robina Corporation.
Procter and Gamble Philippines, Inc. also entered the market in 1999 but stopped in just a few years' time.
Relatively new players in the market include Zest-O Corporation, Liwayway Marketing Corporation, and Ajinomoto Philippines Corporation.
Philippine Beverage Partners Inc. is a subsidiary of Southeast Asia's largest food and beverage company San Miguel Corporation (SMC).
It owns the popular Eight o' Clock brand as well as the Ponkana and Ice Cold Mix brands.
PhilBev also manages other non-carbonated products of San Miguel such Fun Chum and Magnolia ready-to-drink fruit drinks and Wilkin's distilled water and Viva!
PhilBev's juice brands were originally owned by Sugarland International Products Inc. but were acquired by parent firm SMC together with another SMC subsidiary La Tondeña Distillers Inc.
(now Ginebra San Miguel Inc.) in May 2000 for P2.9 billion.
PhilBev has eight flavors for its Eight o' Clock brand (orange, pineapple, dalandan, pomelo, calamansi, lemonade, orange-mango, and orange-pineapple) while its Ice Cold Mix comes in pomelo and pineapple flavors.
Kraft Foods (Philippines) Inc. owns and produces powdered juices using the Tang, Tang Ponkan-C, and Kool-Aid brands.
Its powdered juices are imported from Thailand except for those in one-liter packs which are toll-manufactured locally.
Aside from the tangerine orange flavor (Tang Ponkan-C), Tang comes in seven other flavors, namely, orange, pineapple, grape, guyabano, pomelo, lemon, and mango.
RFM Corporation is the Philippine licensee of Sunkist Growers Inc. to manufacture powdered and ready-to-drink juices using the Sunkist brand.
Sunkist powdered juices are available in eight flavors (orange, pineapple, dalandan, pomelo, lemonade, four seasons, watermelon, and green mango).
RFM recently launched its Sunkist singles in 9-gram packs.
One of the newer players in the powdered juice segment, Ajinomoto Philippines Corporation launched its powdered juices in September 2003 using the Fres-C brand initially in orange, pomelo, and pineapple flavors.
In February 2005, the company added three new flavors - calamansi, guava, and lychee.
Liwayway Marketing Corporation (LMC), known as the manufacturer of Oishi snack food products, entered the powdered juice segment in early 2003 using the Sundays brand.
Sold initially in one-liter packs and in three variants (orange, pineapple and lemonade), Sundays has recently introduced its powdered drinks in 250-gram and 500-gram packs.
The company also launched two additional flavors, namely, dalanghita and mango.
LMC claims it is the first to introduce mango flavored powdered juice in the market, ahead of industry leaders PhilBev and Kraft Foods.
Universal Robina Corporation (URC) launched its powdered juice Refresh in mid-2000 in two flavors - orange and dalandan in 250-gram and 400-gram packs.
In early 2004, however, the company ceased manufacturing the powdered drink to re-think its strategy for the product.
Despite of this, the Refresh brand remains visible as it is being used by URC for its ready-to-drink juice and packaged water.
Zest-O Corporation is the leader in the ready-to-drink juices in doy-packs (flexible foil pouch).
It has powdered juices using the Sunglo brand.
At present, Sunglo is available in three flavors (orange, strawberry, and lemon).
The product used to have the pineapple flavor until early this year when it ceased producing the said variant.
All flavors come in 250-gram, 500-gram, and 750-gram packs.
Another multinational company, Procter & Gamble Philippines Inc. entered the powdered juice segment in 1999 thru its Nutri Delight brand.
The product was positioned as a fortified powdered orange drink with Iron, Vitamin A, and Iodine.
A few years later, however, the company stopped producing Nutri Delight.
The Market The market for powdered juices is estimated to be worth at least P8 billion in 2004.
PhilBev and Kraft are the market leaders.

Key Industry Informant In terms of flavor, industry players say the largest-selling powdered juice flavor remains to be orange while other flavors like pineapple are also performing well.
Trade Powdered juices are classified by the NSO under the Philippine Standard Commodity Classification Code 0989905 as preparations for the manufacture of lemonades or other beverages consisting, for example, of flavored or colored syrup, syrup-flavored with fruit juices.
Trade data revealed that imports outpaced exports for an entire five-year period beginning 2000.
Imports and Exports of Powdered Juice, 2000-2004
IMPORTS EXPORTS Year Volume Value Volume Value
NSO Imports.
From nearly 29,500 tons (US$ (CIF) 49.2 million), imports increased by 53% to about 45,200 tons (US$64.6 million) in 2001.
Growth was fuelled by increased shipments from country-suppliers like the United States of America (USA), Brazil, Ireland, United Kingdom, New Zealand, Thailand, Malaysia, and Taiwan.
The following year, imports contracted by nearly 15% to 43,800 tons (US$70 million), due to the huge drop in purchases from Canada, Brazil, Ireland, United Kingdom, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea.
Only Canada, Brazil, France, New Zealand, India, and Taiwan managed to increase their shipments into the country.
NSO Exports.
The decline was caused by reduced purchases by major buyers like Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.
By 2003, shipments further dropped by 59% to 51 tons (US$ 250,000) due to lower purchases of Taiwan and Hong Kong and non-purchase of South Korea, despite improved exports to Thailand and new shipments to Malaysia, Brunei, Myanmar, Ireland, and Puerto Rico.
In 2004, exports grew by more than five times to 278 tons (US$1.1 million), boosted by large purchases by Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, and South Africa.

Marketing Trends The industry is characterized by stiff competition, particularly in the market for economy packs or powdered drinks in sachets.
Almost all manufacturers have small-serve one liter or litro packs (45 grams), which are sold at very affordable prices of less than P10.
Table 3 shows the retail prices of selected powdered juice brands for various pack sizes.
For the 500-gram pack, Eight o' Clock is more expensive by P0.25 compared to the P38.25 retail price of Tang.
For the 750-gram pack, Sunglo is more affordable at P49.75 compared to P62.50 for Tang.
Eight o' Clock and the other brands do not have this pack size.
Finally, for the 1-kilogram pack, Eight o' Clock is sold cheaper by P3.25 at P76.50 compared to Tang's P79.75. Table 3.

Major supermarket in Mandaluyong City, April 2005 Players also promote their products as healthy and good for the body, emphasizing on the vitamin and mineral contents of their products.
A look at the labels of three popular brands (Eight o' Clock, Tang, and Sunkist) revealed the following nutrition facts:
Vitamin and Mineral Content of Selected Powdered Juice Drinks Vitamin / Mineral Eight o' Clock Tang Sunkist Vitamins
Vitamin C Vitamin A
Vitamin B2
Folic Acid

Beta-Carotene Minerals

Product labels Another "healthy" selling proposition employed for powdered juice drink is promoting it as low calorie.
This is currently being used by PhilBev for its Eight o' Clock and Ponkana products, as well as Ajinomoto's Fres-C.
Lastly, product extension or the introduction of new flavors has been used as a tool to attract consumers.
While the leading brands have the most number of variants, the new players are utilizing this approach to gain market share.
Ajinomoto, for instance, recently introduced flavors never before seen in the market like lychee and guava, while Zest-O Corporation's Sunglo has a strawberry flavor.
At the same time, Eight o' Clock has combined-flavored drinks like orange-mango, and orange-pineapple.
Prospects Research firm AC Nielsen reported that the market for powdered juice drinks is still growing although at a slower rate compared to ready-to-drink juices.
According to players, they expect the segment to post continued growth in the next three to five years.
Performance will be driven mainly by strong demand for economy packs while those in bigger packs will continue to post steady growth rates.
The entry of new players, despite the pull-out of URC, indicates a growing market.
Existing players view this as a challenge since more would mean more product options for the consumer.
Industry sources say innovation would remain vital for success.
Most importantly, the trend towards healthier, better-for-you products is still expected to fuel growth as powdered juice presents itself as a "better" beverage than substitutes like ice tea and carbonated drinks.
Now, there is a pending bill in Congress which seeks to prohibit the use of aspartame, a sweetener used in powdered juices.
Overall though, industry players project a bright future for their business.
In the short- term, sales are expected to move-up as consumers gulp more of powdered juice drinks as the summer heat intensifies.

Market Information Southeast Asia Drink all you can:
A Glimpse of the Imported Fruit Juice Market* February 2005
Abner T. Montecalvo Kay S. Olivas Ma. Lourdes P. Vivo Graduate Students Food Systems Management (FSM) Program University of Asia and the Pacific Consumption of fruit juices and non-carbonated drinks in the Philippines has increased considerably from P3 billion (at current prices) in 1993 to about P7.2 billion in 2000, a hefty increase of 137% (National Statistics Office - Family Income and Expenditure Survey, 2000).
Fruit juice supply in the country comes mainly from local production.
Imports are still rather small although they have been posting consistent growth over the years.
How fruit juices are made Fruit juices, along with vegetable juices, are "generally obtained by pressing fresh, healthy and ripe fruit vegetable."
Juices are "obtained by means of mechanical "extractors" operating on the same principle as the household lemon squeezer, or by pressing, which may or may not be preceded either by crushing or grinding (for apples) in particular or by treatment with cold water or with steam (in the case of tomatoes, blackcurrants and certain vegetables such as carrots and celery)."
Trends in imported fruit juices Fruit juices are generally imported in the form of either fruit juice extracts for use as raw material, or finished juice drinks.
In the Philippines, official customs data classify the imported products according to the type of fruit (e.g. orange), form (concentrate) and state (frozen or not frozen).
Fruit juices are also classified according to the degree of sweetness (Brix content).
From 2000-2004, the country imported over 9,500 tons of juices yearly worth more than US$7.5 million annually (Table 1).
The leading suppliers were the United States of America (USA), Australia and Israel.
The leading juice imports during the same period were orange juice, other than concentrates, not frozen and juice of any single fruit/vegetable, other than concentrates.
The former accounted for close to a fifth of the total value of juice imports while the latter, for 12%.
The main country sources were the USA and Australia.
Volume and value of imported juices, 2000-2004
National Statistics Office Meanwhile, about 70% of the total value of juice imports is in the form of juices, other than concentrates, or finished juice drinks.
The rest is accounted for by juice concentrates, the share of which has been increasing in the past five years.
Imports are mostly those of fruits which are not locally grown such as apples, oranges, grapes, and grapefruit.
By fruit type, imports are dominated by orange juices (both concentrates and other than concentrates, frozen and not frozen).
The leading suppliers were also Australia, the USA and Israel.
Key players Importers of fruit juices are composed of both fruit juice or food processors and importer-distributors.
As of 2003, there were 126 registered importers of fruit juices, according to the Bureau of Import Statistics.
The top ten importers in 2003 accounted for more than half of the total value of fruit juice imports.
The juices are imported from countries like Australia, Spain, South Africa, USA, Cyprus/Nicosia and Austria.
The available brands in the market include:

Regulations and requirements in the importation of fruit juices Tariffs and taxes.
Import duties are levied by the Bureau of Customs at the time of import and are required to be paid to the government before the incoming shipment is allowed entry into the country.
Another tax paid on imported juices is the value added tax (VAT).
A 10% VAT is charged on total landed cost, a value that includes the CIF cost, import duties, brokerage fees, wharfage and other charges.
Quality standards.
Imported foods, beverages and agricultural food products are required to comply with certain regulations concerning food safety.
The importation of packaged foods such as juices is covered by the Food and Drug Act, which ensures that Filipino consumers are provided with safe and good quality food.
The Act establishes standards and quality measures for food and sets up the enforcement framework necessary to ensure a safe supply of food in the country.
It covers both locally manufactured and imported products.
While they pose competition to local juices as well as other non-alcoholic beverages such fruit-flavored soda, they provide the consumers a wide array of choices - especially, juices from fruits that are not locally or commonly grown in the Philippines.
It should be noted though that imported juices are priced higher than their local counterpart.
Prices are affected mainly by the fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rate.
The market consists of those belonging to income brackets A, B and upper C, given that most imported juices command higher prices.
As people become more health conscious, they learn to appreciate the benefits that they can derive from natural fruit juices.
As defined in the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System Explanatory Notes, World Customs Organization 2.
There are two major reasons why fruit juices are made into concentrates within the country of origin: (1) environmental and ecological and, (2) commercial and costs.
About 5/6 of freshly picked pressed fruit juice consist of water; the rest is juice.
It is this 1/6 which serves as the basis for the fruit juice concentrates prior to transportation it does not make sense to transport to ship 5/6 of the end product or water or transport in trucks across half the world since this will be a waste of energy.
Apart from that, it would result in prices for the finished product being driven up to acceptable levels (from www.pfanner.com).
Market Information Southeast Asia Pasta!
(A Look into the Philippine Market for Imported and Local Pasta) *
Ronald G. Omaña Researcher Center for Food and Agri Business  University of Asia and the Pacific
Pasta is the generic Italian term for many noodle-like doughs that are made in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.
According to the National Pasta Association of the United States, more than 600 pasta shapes are produced around the world whose names come from their shape.
Although its true beginnings are somewhat unclear, Italy is recognized as the home of pasta in modern times.
This is attributed to the Italian traveler Marco Polo who is said to have brought pasta to Italy from China 700 years ago.
Pasta then reached the United Kingdom through aristocrats touring Europe.
By the nineteenth century, immigrants brought with them their pasta-eating custom.
The British are believed to have introduced pasta into the United States.
They taught the practice of cooking noodles at least half an hour and mixing them with cream sauce and cheese.
TYPES OF PASTA Pastas are classified into two types – dried and fresh.
Leading food manufacturer Hormel Foods describes the two pasta types as follows:
Dried Pasta (Pasta Secca) Dried pasta is readily available in many sizes and shapes.
It is factory made and fully dried before it is packaged.
It rarely contains eggs so it can be stored indefinitely without refrigerating or freezing.
Its firmness also allows it to be stored easily without damage.
Fresh Pasta (Pasta Fresca) Fresh pasta is available in a variety of sizes and shapes but not to the extent of dried pasta.
It also comes in a greater variety of flavors.
Fresh pasta most often contains eggs and has high water content, making refrigeration or freezing necessary to keep it from spoiling.
GLOBAL PRODUCTION In 2003, Italy's pasta producer association, the Unione Industriali Pastai Italiani has estimated world pasta production at 9.3 million tons.
The three leading producers are the European Union (EU) which accounted for 43% of total production, followed by Central and South America (19%), North America (16%), and other European countries (12%).
Countries in North Africa, Asia, and Oceania regions contributed 5%, 3% and 1%, respectively.
THE PLAYERS The Philippines pasta market is composed of big firms which are also players in other agri-food industries.
These include Unilever Bestfoods (formerly California Manufacturing Co.
(DMPI), RFM Corporation, Ideal Macaroni & Spaghetti Factory Inc., Universal Robina Corporation (URC) and General Milling Corporation (GMC).
Major retailers Supervalue Inc.
(SM Supermarkets) and Robinson's Supermarket Inc. also have pasta for their private labels SM Bonus and Supersavers, respectively.
Food and beverage conglomerate Nestle Phils.
Inc. is said to have its own pasta products under the Maggi brand which is sold only to the foodservice industry.
Some of the local players have developed separate brands to capture both the AB and CD markets.
For instance, Unilever Bestfoods has Knorr Royal for the high-end market and Bestfoods for the low-end market.
Ideal Macaroni & Spaghetti Factory, meanwhile, has Ideal (high-end), and Sunshine (low-end).
General Milling Corporation also adopted this strategy with its Homepride (high-end) and Magnifico (low-end) brands. Other companies like DMPI, RFM, and URC maintain only one brand each.

MARKET Industry sources estimate the overall market for pasta at P2.5 billion in 2003, up from about P1.5 billion in 2000.
A key player, however, indicated that the value could be much higher.
Household spending on pasta, which is lumped together with bihon, miki, misua, sotanghon, etc., reached P3.7 billion in 2000, up by 12% from P3.3 billion in 1997.
The amount accounted for about 2% of the entire household spending for cereals and cereal preparations for both years.
Research firm ACNielsen classified pasta under the slightly increasing food category - with growth of 5% to 9% per year.
Pasta grew by 8% as of April 2005, an improvement from its stable rating (growth rate of -4% to 4%) in October 2003.
Despite the numerous kinds of pasta which could be offered in the market, the pasta products of the major local players are more often limited to spaghetti and macaroni (elbow and/or salad types).
By contrast, the other imported brands have more diverse offerings such as lasagna, linguine, fettucine, bowtie, spirals, penne and small shells, etc.
In terms of overall market shares by brand in 2003, Unilever Bestfoods' Knorr Royal led with share of 25%, followed by RFM Corporation's White King Fiesta (17%) and DMPI's Del Monte (12%).
Ideal Macaroni & Spaghetti Factory's Ideal brand captured 8% of the market while URC's El Real and GMC's Magnifico had 6% each of the market.
Other brands which include the imported labels shared in the remaining 17% of the market.

Industry Estimates
In terms of market channel, sources say Knorr Royal, Del Monte and Ideal are the three leading brands in supermarkets and groceries.
In the wet market, where pasta is placed in big plastic basins and sold on a per-scoop basis, Ideal is the undisputed leader followed by White King Fiesta.
Ideal Macaroni & Spaghetti Factory Inc. claims leadership in the foodservice channel as it caters to many of the major players in the fast food industry.
By target market, Knorr Royal is the leader in the high-end market for spaghetti.
Del Monte is next and then, Ideal.
For the low-end market, White King Fiesta is on top, followed by Sunshine.
For the macaroni market, Ideal is the leading brand in the high-end category, followed by Knorr Royal.
For the low-end market, White King Fiesta captures the lead, followed by Sunshine.
Interestingly, Ideal and Sunshine maker Ideal Macaroni & Spaghetti Factory Inc. also produces the SM Bonus spaghetti and macaroni for the SM supermarket chain.
For the imported brands, the main market channels are the hotels and restaurants and the major supermarkets.
Sources say the market for pasta is still influenced heavily by "occasions" as reflected by the product's lean and peak periods.
Lean months are January, February, June, and July while the peak months include April and May where fiestas are usually held, and November and December, the holiday season.
TRADE Pasta trade has been in favor of imports throughout the five-year period beginning 2000.
The National Statistics Office (NSO) classifies pasta under five Philippine Standard Commodity Classification Codes: 0483009 - other uncooked pasta, not stuffed, containing eggs; 0483011 – macaroni, spaghetti and lasagna, uncooked, not stuffed, containing eggs; 0483019 – other uncooked pasta, not stuffed, not containing eggs; 0989101/0989105 – pasta (e.g. macaroni, spaghetti, reviolli, lasagna, vermicelli, cannelloni, tortellino, and the like); and 0989109 – other pasta.
By 2002, shipments to the country increased further by 37% to 16,000 tons (US$8.7 million).
In 2003, however, a sharp decline of 50% was registered as purchases reached only 8,000 tons; value dropped by nearly the same rate to US$4.6 million.
The contraction was brought about by the decrease in imports in all categories.
By 2004, import volumes rose by a huge 82% to nearly 15,000 tons equivalent to US$8.0 million.
Overall, imports grew by an average rate of 31% per year while value expanded by 21% per annum from 2000-2004.
NSO
Interestingly, leading player Unilever Bestfoods buys its spaghetti from this country.
Australia was followed by Italy (4%), Taiwan (3%), and South Korea (2%).
Other countries shared in the remaining 9% of total value of imports.
Pasta exports ballooned from only a little over 500 tons (US$1.5 million) in 2000 to 1,600 tons (US$4.0 million) in 2001.
In 2004, volumes improved by 13% to 2,500 tons (US$6.9 million).
From 2000-2004, exports grew by more than 200% annually on volume and by 300% yearly on value.
This was because of the very low base in 1999 of only 57 tons amounting to US$91,000 as compared to 979 tons worth US$1.6 million in 2000.

PROSPECTS Players see the pasta market to maintain its growth of 8% to 10% in the next three to five years.
Performance will still be driven by the numerous fiestas and celebrations all over the country.
The growth in population and incomes are also seen to help the business keep its uphill climb.
The edge of instant noodles over pasta is its ease of preparation (3-5 minutes) compared to pasta which normally requires 10 to 15 minutes.
To address this concern, players say the consumers must be taught innovative ways of using pasta aside from the usual spaghetti or baked macaroni.
In recent years, the marketing strategies used to boost sales included bundling pasta with a complementing product – sauces.
RFM Corporation, meanwhile, utilized a celebrity to endorse its product and placed her picture on the packaging.
Another strategy, employed by Unilever Bestfoods, is the emphasis on the vitamin and mineral content of pasta to attract health-conscious consumers.
Another growth factor for the industry is the expanding fast food industry where spaghetti remains as a favorite menu item.
Importers, meanwhile, expect slower expansion rate for imported pasta as it competes with local pasta in terms of quality but sold at more affordable prices.
As more and more consumers enjoy eating pasta, the industry would definitely enjoy a more than an ‘al dente' pasta business.

The Philippine chicken industry is a significant contributor to the  country's agriculture sector.
It is third after palay and hog in terms of value of output.
Chicken production in 2004 was about 1.2M tons live weight, of which around 65% was broiler.
But where are we as compared with other countries?
The top world producers are the United States of America (USA), with a share of 27%; China, 17%; Brazil, 15%; and European Union, 13%.
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  Philippines - Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI)
Among the Asian countries, China, Japan and Thailand have consistently been the top producers.
However, China and Thailand are not exporters while Japan is a net importer.
The Philippines is way behind producing an average of only 570,000 tons per year.
Consumption World consumption of chicken meat in 2004 reached 53.3M tons.
The USA is the world's largest consumer both in aggregate and per capita terms.
It is among the lowest when compared to Asian countries like Japan (14.5 kg per capita) and Thailand (12.7 kg) but higher than Indonesia (3.1 kg) and India (1.5 kg).
It is even far lower compared to developed countries like the USA and Canada with 43.2 kg and 29.2 kg, respectively.
Brazil, Australia and New Zealand also have high consumption of more than 30 kilograms per capita.
Poultry International, May 2005
Exports World poultry exports in 2004 were almost stagnant compared to 2003, as major importing countries banned the entry of poultry products because of the outbreak of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).
The outbreak led major producers in Asia such as Thailand and China to stop exporting chilled and frozen chicken.
On the other hand, some countries still managed to sustain positive growth despite the impact of HPAI.

Japan, for instance, which sourced bulk of its processed chicken requirement from Thailand, had reduced tremendously its imports from this country and looked for alternative sources.
Because of the Philippines' proximity to Japan and because it was HPAI-free during the major outbreak, it paved the way for Philippine chicken to enter the Japanese market.
The first shipment to Japan was in March 2004 by San Miguel Purefoods.
For 2004, exports of chicken meat and meat cuts reached 1,560 tons (industry data).
Bulk of exports was in the form of frozen boneless leg and frozen wing stick.
Recently, however, there have been reports that a low-risk bird flu strain has reached the Philippines.
Imports Import demand for broiler meat has declined by 10% in 2004.
The big importers like Japan and China have reduced the entry of poultry products into their territories by as much as 16% and 60%, respectively, due to the HPAI.

Russia is the number one importer and the biggest market for the United States.
It is followed by Japan which has high demand for boneless chicken meat, and the European Union (EU).
The EU imposes the strictest environmental and animal welfare laws.
Exporting to EU entails the highest cost.
The Philippines imposes quantitative restrictions on poultry imports.
The country imports chicken meat and meat cuts in order to augment local supply.
Imports reached a high of 23 million kg in 2004, up by 44% from 2003.
In 2004, chicken leg quarters accounted 75.5% of the total meat imports while deboned chicken and chicken cuts cornered 23.7%.
The rest of the imports were in the form of whole chicken and chicken fats, which contributed a measly share.
Prices and Cost Movements in live broiler prices in key countries reflect developments in world broiler trade.
Among the key countries, China and Brazil experienced decreasing prices of live broilers.
Brazil registered the lowest prices ranging from P26-P27/kg, while Thailand recorded lower prices relative to China and the Philippines.
The Philippines, although not a major world producer as compared to Thailand and China, had higher broiler prices of P39-P43/kg.
Live broiler prices are reflective of the cost of production.
A comparison of cost performance across key broiler countries in Asia showed that Brazil was the lowest cost producer as it had the lowest cost of corn and soybean meal.
China, in contrast, had the lowest labor cost.
The Philippines posted the highest input cost, particularly, for corn and day-old chicks (DOC).

Yanson (2005) The Plus Factors
The Philippine broiler industry possesses a competitive edge.
First, Filipino buyers still prefer warm meat over frozen meat.
Because of this, the entry of frozen chicken remains limited as household consumers still prefer to buy fresh, chilled chicken over frozen ones.
Second, the Philippines is fortunate not to be included in the HPAI affected areas during the major outbreak in 2003.
While there have been reports that a low-risk flu strain found in ducks has already entered the country, the Philippines was able to confine it in a small isolated farm.
The Philippines was somehow given time for HPAI preparedness through prevention programs crafted by industry players and government.
Another plus factor is the expected growth in chicken consumption due to its price advantage versus other meats, higher per capita income and increase in population.
Can we compete?
The Philippines, even with its advantage of being HPAI-free, can barely export chicken due to uncompetitive cost.
The country's cost of production is way above other producing countries due to high cost of corn and DOC.
Corn is a major input to broiler feeds, accounting for about 70% of cost.
The Philippines can export provided it has access to low cost of inputs.
A low tariff corn from Thailand, for example, could help lower the total cost of production.
Another possibility is to concentrate on higher value-added chicken addressing the demand for cooked products in other countries such as Japan.
Brazil will remain as the biggest exporter of chicken to the world, followed by the US.
The US is strong in bone-in legs export due to consumers preference for white meat.
The EU, which has the most stringent environmental and animal welfare laws, will continue to be a major exporter.
Thailand is slowly shifting to cooked products form instead of frozen chicken.
This is where the Philippines can also come in with cost considerations.
The Philippine broiler industry will continue to be an import-dependent industry primarily because of dependency on the importation of DOC Grand Parent Stocks.

CAN-SEA Agri-Food Update June-September 2006
RECENT AGRI-FOOD ACTIVITIES A Halal Seminar was held in Brunei on August 8-9, in conjunction with International Halal Products Expo 2006.
Three Canadian speakers were invited – Mr Falal Alizzi (ZABIHA Halal), Dr Mohammed Ashraf (Islamic Society of North America) and Mr Pervez Nasim (Canadian Islamic Trust Foundation).
In mid August, Post in Brunei participated in the Domestic Science Exhibition organised in conjunction with the Sultan's birthday.
At this event, the spouses of the diplomatic corps organised a booth and invited participation from various foreign missions.
Post took the opportunity to showcase Canadian Wild Rice and Maple Syrup.
There was lots of public interest, including that of Queen and Princesses, in the wild rice.
As a follow-up, Post is seeking Canadian suppliers to work the Brunei market.
On September 18, Singapore organised the CPI Pork Seminar and the event was well attended by key members of the Meat Traders Association (MTA), who saw Canadian pork as growing in popularity and positioned as a high-end pork product in the market.
Senior representatives from the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority (AVA) also graced the occasion, lending support to the event.
AVA has been supporting the efforts of Canadian companies to increase their pork exports, as it is in Singapore’s interest to diversify its supply sources.
Martin Lavoie, CPI’s Assistant Executive Director and member Jeffrey Clarke codelivered a presentation highlighting the opportunities for Singapore to adopt Canadian pork products.
Thereafter, a networking luncheon featuring Canadian pork was served to an appreciative audience.
The CPI seminar also addressed the interest of some Singapore pork importers to be part of a pork mission of MTA members and AVA.
Post plans to organise a buyers’ trip for them to Canada during SIAL Montréal in 2007.
Canada continues to press hard and vigorously with the Indonesian government to obtain access for Canadian beef and beef products.
On June 20, following the announcement of Thailand opening borders to Canadian beef issued by Agriculture and Agri-food Canada, the Embassy had the Press Release translated into Thai and sent it to general and business media to raise awareness that the ban on Canadian beef has been lifted.
The Embassy hired people who produce a monthly magazine called " Thailand Restaurant News" to create a onepage leaflet that includes information about the lifting of the ban on Canadian beef in Thailand.
On July 25-26, Canada Pork International (CPI) Executive Director Jacques Pomerleau, facilitated by Thailand agri-food Trade Commissioner Surin Thanalertkul, met with Pork Kings, the largest of Thai pork abattoirs and two meat processing plants Vanguard Foods (Thailand) and Betagro Foods to find out more about the rules and practicalities of exporting pork to Thailand, and to determine an approach to gaining wider access for Canadian pork products.
On September 11, the Canadian Food Exporters Association (CFEA) in support of the Embassy organised a half-day Canadian Food Ingredients Seminar at the Four Seasons Hotel.
This seminar and networking session featured presenters from Bartek Ingredients Inc. and FONA International Canada who spoke on malic acid (Bartek) and taste perceptions (FONA) to about 50 people from the Thailand food processing industry.
Bartek, with 20% of the world market for the flavour blending ingredient malic acid, was able to explain the benefits of malic acid in food preparations.
On September 12, Bruce Howard - Counsellor and Trade Commissioner - Regional - ASEAN (Agriculture, Food and Agbiotech), Anderson Blanc and Surin Thanalertkul, Trade Commissioner at Post met with three officials from the Bureau of Disease Control and Veterinary Services at the Department of Livestock Development (DLD) to follow up on the pork export health certificate, the visit of pork establishments by Thai officials to Canada and the current anthrax situation in Canada.
Both companies expressed early satisfaction with the number and quality of leads they had obtained from the show.
Canadian officials visited Vietnam AAFC ADM Andrew Marsland & VP CFIA Krista Mountjoy visited Hanoi from July 16 – 18, 2006 to discuss a number of market access issues with the Vietnamese government.
Food and Hotel Vietnam Exhibition (FHV 2006) Presenting a diverse showcase of the latest food and drink products, equipment, technologies and supplies, FHV 2006 answered the sourcing needs of 7,240 buyers over three days from 27 – 29 September 2006.
Into its 3rd edition this year, FHV 2006 featured over 180 exhibiting companies from 20 countries and eight country/regional group pavilions.
There was total 7,240 visitors to the exhibition.
Vietnamese malting barley mission to Canada A Vietnamese mission of companies in the beer industry went to Canada from June 23 - July 3, 2006 to attend training on Canadian malt & malting barley.
The training was successfully conducted by the Canadian International Grain Institute (CIGI) & Canada Malting Barley Tecnical Centre (CMBTC).
It was aimed at raising the Canadian malting & brewing industry profile and included these topics : barley varieties; barley grading, selection and quality control; Canadian grain marketing and its transportation system and run-off demonstration.
Canadian Barley succeeds in Vietnam Parrish & Heimbecker (http://www.parheim.mb.ca), a Canadian grain dealer, has successfully signed several million dollar contracts with a Vietnamese malting company, Duong Malt Ltd. to export 25,000 tons of Canadian malting barley to Vietnam from this crop year.
Canadian barley has so far been recognized for its high soluble protein, diastatic power and extract level.
This will place much demand for consumer services (e.g., insurance) as well as for natural resources and manufactured goods throughout the region.
Combined imports of wine from these countries last year totalled more than 6.6 million litres - outstripping the 4.3 million litres imported from what has been termed the "Old World".
Latest data from IE Singapore show that only five years ago, wine imports of 3.6 million litres from the New World trailed the 3.8 million litres from the Old World.
Wine imports from New Zealand led the rise - jumping four-fold, followed by Argentina and Chile.
However, with Old World wines being more expensive, the Old World countries continued to lead in the value of wines imported.
They chalked up S$80.5 million last year compared to the New World's S$70 million.
Wine lovers will get to indulge in their passion when vintners come to showcase their wines during the Wine for Asia 2006 exhibition in November.
Singapore now imports from Indonesia after banning Malaysian pork when its hogs were infected with the nipah virus several years ago.
However, Singapore wants to cease importing live animals (its main form of import from Indonesia) since this is costly as the shipment brings along the waste from the live animal transport.
Indonesia has inadequacies in its slaughtering facilities, according to a Philippines official, and this is where the Philippines should have an advantage.
If Singapore approves pork from the Philippines, the result could be an eventual shake-up of the local pork supply scene as Singapore currently relies mainly on fresh/chilled pork from Australia and Indonesia, and frozen pork from China, South America and Canada.
Adapted from Manila Bulletin (September 2006) FOOD INDUSTRY TO BE EXPANDED UNDER IMP3, EMPHASIS ON HALAL FOOD - MALAYSIA The food processing industry will be expanded and diversified towards making Malaysia a regional food production and distribution hub, with particular emphasis on halal products, under the third Industrial Master Plan (IMP3).
The halal industry covers food, non-food products such as pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, as well as services, including logistics, tourism and marketing.
The report said that to expand Malaysia's food processing industry, the government would also upgrade human resource and technology, enhance R&D, undertake the production and export of highvalue added and niche products, and adopting quality standards.
Three main factors identified to drive the demand for food products are changes in disposable incomes, changes in consumer demand and global trade liberalisation.
The report said growth areas that have been identified are convenience foods, functional foods, food ingredients and related support services.
The report said that there are several challenges that needed to be addressed in order for Malaysia to become a regional food production and distribution hub, such as insufficient supply of raw material, technology and product development, quality and safety and market access.
AGRI-FOOD NEWS FROM THE REGION VIETNAM’S DAIRY SECTOR IN DILEMMA PRIIOR TO WTO ACCESSION Vietnam's dairy cow raising industry is now put in a stalemate as many farmers have felt it necessary to curtail finance for their breeding programs in the wake of the country's forthcoming entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Although fresh milk which is imported currently has to face an import tariff of 20% plus VAT, once Vietnam becomes a WTO member the import tariff will be reduced by half at least, thereafter making domestically produced fresh milk uncompetitive.
Last year, Vietnam's dairy cow supplied processing factories with 198,000 tons of fresh milk compared with some 470,000 tons worth $311 million that was imported.
Since many of the provincially organized, state sponsored or encouraged programs have or are about to go bankrupt for a variety of reasons, most of the local farmers engaged in the field have either had to accept their losses and switch to alternatives or face even greater debt.
Tuyen Quang, one of the 33 provinces and cities nationwide that have been developing dairy cow herds, has recently decided to put an end to its dairy farming program which was prompted in 2002.
Local participating farmers have so far born losses of at least $15 million and are accusing the provincial authorities of bad consideration and short view on anticipated advantages and the economic effectiveness of the originally contemplated scheme.
When the development programs were originally drawn up in 2002, many of the provincial governments, following successes in Ho Chi Minh City and Binh Duong and Long An provinces, encouraged their farmers and local enterprises to buy expensive, imported dairy cows disregarding the long term economic effectiveness or competitiveness of the projects.
A majority of farmers then rushed out to buy imported cows at more than $1,500 each, excluding veterinary medicine and ongoing upkeep costs.
Nguyen Dang Vang, head of the country's Livestock Production Department, said at least 10 out of 33 provinces and cities had stopped developing dairy herds out of fear of accumulating yet further financial losses.
Vang added that some local governments had also been impetuous in requesting local farmers and enterprises to buy dairy cows since they saw the program as a quick fix to improving the standards of living for many poor local farmers.
According to the agriculture ministry's Institute for Agriculture and Rural Development Strategies and Policies, the country's total current herd of about 106,000 dairy cows is valued at between $100-160 million, excluding other ancillary and associated costs and expenses that it estimated to amount to an equivalent sum.
Several observers liken this continuing growth to that of China beginning in the late 1980s and continuing today.
Tourism continues to increase, registering increases in 2005 of 18.4% over 2004, and reached 3.5 million arrivals in 2005.
Tourist arrivals for January and February 2006 were up 15% from year ago levels.
Except for 2003, when SARS was a factor, tourism arrivals since 2000 have increased every year from the year previous, from 2.1 million in 2000 to 3.5 million in 2005.
With consumer spending in Vietnam growing in leaps and bounds, a new momentum has been created for retailers to penetrate and expand their business into an untapped domestic market.
Ho Chi Minh City’s food sector not only has to serve its 6-7 million people and its tourism industry, but also needs to prepare sufficient raw materials for the enterprises that process food for export.
In addition, the sector has to keep some food in reserve for use during natural disasters or other unpredictable need.
As a result of modernization and the city’s development, people are using fewer raw materials to prepare their daily meals and are instead using more packaged ready-to-eat or ready–to-cook food.
Food accounts for 50% of the average person’s monthly expenditures.
The Vietnamese government is also carrying out major programs to increase food production (like rice, tapioca and corn) and enhance food processing technologies, which will require raw inputs.
METRO BUILDS SEVENTH STORE Metro Cash & Carry Vietnam begins work on another Metro wholesale centre in HCMC’s district 12, the third one in the city and the seventh one nationwide.
The US$15-million Metro Hiep Phu wholesale centre covers 5.5 ha and will be completed later this year.
The eight one will be opened in Hanoi next year.
The company says Vietnam is one of the main markets of Metro Cash & Carry besides the Eastern Europe market, and is the strong base for the company expand further in the Asian market in the future.
VISSAN PROCESSES FAST FOOD FOR DOMESTIC MARKET The Vietnam Meat Processing and Import-Export Corp. (VISSAN), is processing fast food and will introduce this new product in October 2006.
Saigon Times Daily, September 18, 2006 SAIGON CO-OP SET TO EXPAND CONVENIENCE STORE CHAIN Vietnam’s leading supermarket chain operator Saigon Co.op opens nine more Co.op convenience stores in HCMC, bringing to 31 the total in the City.
The company has invested VND 30-50 million (US$2000-5000) in each store.
The company expects to get 50 new stores in HCMC this year so that it can increase the figure to 100 late next year.

Indonesia spends US$ 300 millions per year to import soybean.
According to the Indonesian Bureau of Statistic, Indonesia imported 1.1 million tons of soybean in 2005, dropping from 1.2 million tons in 2003.
Indonesia’s Soybean Imports, 2003-2005 DA PLANS TO ESTABLISH PHP 150 MIL BIOTECH LABORATORY Year 2003 2004 2005 Volume (ton) 1,192,717 1,115,792 1,086,178 Value (US$’000) 330,000 416,930 308,009 The Department of Agriculture (DA) is putting up a Php 150-million (C$3.4 million) biotechnology incubator laboratory that will upgrade startup enterprises into small but commercially viable ventures.
This will enable the Philippines to ship out natural ingredient-based plant extracts.
The economically cost-effective business incubator center is harnessing the Philippines' abundant supply of indigenous plants which are natural ingredients for semi-processed products that are also raw materials for other high-valued, exportable products.
A particularly prospective product is the extract from the indigenous olasiman which is known to contain omega 3 fatty acids rich in proteins that were once known only to be found in fish oil.
The government is running after the October season of anato, more popularly known as the achuete, for the opening of the laboratory since the natural coloring ingredient has become an "in" substance.
This is in light of evidences of its being food-safe and a non-carcinogenic dye that will substitute synthetic food colorings that are harmful t human health.
It is estimated that products using natural ingredients have a huge $6 million market in the United States, Japan, Europe, South Korea, and other countries particularly for pharmaceutical uses alone.
Amid a gamut of business opportunities in biotechnology, the incubation center will zero in on the production of plant extracts that have wide applications in food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and industries.
Among the natural ingredients sources are saluyot, malunggay, banaba, and sambong.
Manila Bulletin, 17 September 2006 NESTLE PICKS MALAYSIA AS HALAL HUB With regard to the expansion of soybean plantations, Mr. Mulkan said that the Ministry plans to carry out three programs: growth centre, partnership, and business development.
These programs will basically provide security to production and marketing.
The Ministry is expecting to see the result by 2007 with an increase of soybean plantations to two million hectares.
This presents excellent export opportunities for Canadian dairy product suppliers.
Business Bulletin, 12 Sep 2006
Mr. Mulkan also added that the Ministry of Agriculture projected that Indonesia will be a soybean self-sufficient country in 2010.
Nestle has chosen Malaysia as its global halal food production centre to meet the growing demand for such products.
More than 30% of Nestle (Malaysia) exports are for the Middle East.
A large portion of exports are for the Indonesian market while Singapore and the Philippines, with substantial numbers of Muslims, are also important markets.
The company is in a position to meet the demand for halal food, which will rise in line with the growing global Muslim population of two billion.
Nestle aim to develop Malaysia as the halal hub and a culinary competence centre while countries such as Thailand and Indonesia are strategic regional suppliers of liquid milks, the Philippines of milk powder and breakfast cereals and Singapore of malt extract.
Malaysia is in Nestle’s Asia-Oceania-Africa Zone, is the regional supplier of Kit Kat, Smarties, Milo and cereals.
On average, 70% of Nestle’s products for the Malaysian market are manufactured locally while 30% are imported.
The Edge Financial Daily, 21 August 2006
CAN-SEA Agri-Food Update June-September 2006 AGRI-FOOD NEWS FROM THE REGION REPORT - Food and Hotel Asia 2006, April 25-28, Singapore CANADIAN FIRMS CAN PARTAKE IN MALAYSIA'S FASTGROWING HALAL INDUSTRY With a major portion of their nation's farm income derived from livestock, Canadian firms can form joint ventures to develop Malaysia's fast-growing halal food industry, says Datuk Seri Rafidah Aziz.
The Minister of International Trade and Industry told some 300 participants at a seminar here that with Malaysia poised to be halal hub, "it will be good if we can source some raw materials we do not have from Canada."
She said "raw materials from Canada can be used to produce halal products and certify them as halal by using our standards and then market it globally from Malaysia."
Australia and New Zealand were two main suppliers of halal beef for Malaysia.
Besides being a promoted sector in Malaysia, there was a huge market for halal products globally, she said.
Malaysia's potential as a halal hub was primarily due to it being a Muslim country while the country has been the front runner in promoting the halal sector by incorporating domestic and international Halal Standards as well as producing Halal products by using various technologies.
She said this when responding to a question on Malaysia's competitive position in becoming a halal hub and on the upcoming World Halal Forum in Kuala Lumpur at a seminar on "Business Opportunities in Malaysia," Thursday.
Rafidah is leading a trade and investment mission to Canada comprising 49 representatives from the private sector, MITI, Malaysia Industrial Development Authority, Malaysia External Trade Development Corp, the state governments of Penang, Perak, Kedah, Sabah and Selangor as well as Multimedia Development Corp Malaysia.
She said the department of Islamic Development Malaysia (JAKIM) has been authorised to produce the halal logo and give it a global recognition.
JAKIM has set the necessary Halal standards that need to be followed by halal food and services providers.
The United Nations has accepted the certification by JAKIM for halal products.
"We are now in the process of getting other agencies aboard, such as from Canada and if possible an Islamic Authority from here that can help to become a correspondent certification authority later on for some products that we source from Canada," she said.
Currently, Malaysia is marketing its halal standards globally, especially to Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) countries, she said.
The upcoming World Halal Forum aims to bring together people who produce and supply products and services that are halal and also exchange ideas on ways to market halal products.
Industry estimates put the global halal market at between halfa-trillion to US$2.5 trillion annually.
Rafidah also explained that the process of producing Halal products does not stop at slaughtering livestock according to Islamic procedures but includes hygienic practices and products used in the process of producing the goods and services.
The minister said investments in the halal sector, especially in the Eastern Corridor in states like Kelantan, Terengganu, Northern Johor, Pahang, Sabah and Sarawak would enjoy more tax holidays compared with other states in the country.
"The value of tax incentives in the Eastern Corridor is higher than elsewhere as we like to divert some of our manufacturing to less developed states, away from the central regions of Malaysia to enable them to benefit from the country's industrialisation.
"We encourage investors to go there.
If you get 70 percent tax exemption here (in the central region), then its 100 percent there (in the Eastern Corridor)," she said.
SE Asia Trade Commissioners were very active in introducing their buyers to our companies.
At least 3 Canadian firms exhibited elsewhere in the Show and at least 2 others were "walking the Show".
A record number of exhibitors, and probably visitors, proved that FHA is the show to be at in Asia.
We purchased space in each of the Show Dailies (Show newspaper) to highlight Canadian products, and this included an editorial write-up.
Exhibitors completed evaluation forms and all commented favourably on the show, the Canadian presence and the leads generated.
Agri-food Trade Commissioners and Trade Commissioner Assistants from the eight countries in SE Asia [Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia (2), Philippines (2), Singapore (3), Thailand, and Vietnam (2)] attended and were key to introducing Canadian companies to potential buyers they might not otherwise have met.
FOOD AND HOTEL ASIA 2008 - RECRUITMENT It is not too early to start thinking about your participation in the FHA2008.
Stay tuned to this newsletter for details as to how your export marketing efforts to SE Asia can be enhanced as part of the federally-sponsored Canadian Pavilion.
Thank you very much for organizing one of the most successful Singapore shows on record.
The welcome kits, the Canada booklets and the advertising in the show dailies certainly helped present a very positive image for Canada and the exhibitors.
It is too early to say with certainty, but I am confident that (we) will return in 2008."
"Food and Hotel Asia is one of the premier food shows in the world and provides broad Asian regional exposure.
It provides an excellent opportunity to meet with key Asian food buyers from countries such as India, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong, China and Korea.
I would recommend this show as an excellent opportunity to introduce Canadian food products not just in Singapore but throughout Asia in one single event.
The show is in same class as Anuga or Sial."
"It was very much my, and CanGro's pleasure to be part of the Canadian presence at the FHA Show last month.
I received many leads to follow; and I gained some very good insights into a wide range of markets, suppliers, and products that we would never be exposed to over here.
This was a MUCH better show than 2004 for volume, variety, and quality of international Buyers ... this might be a function of improved economies over there.
And finally, I would comment that your team did a FANTASTIC job with organizing everything, and being on hand to help all the time.
And the Pavilion was much, much improved …all in all, a great improvement over the last few shows."
CAN-SEA Agri-Food Update A quarterly newsletter presented by Canada’s agri-food team in South East Asia This newsletter is available in English & French at the Agri-food Trade Service Website : www.ats.agr.gc.ca
Our team of Canadian Agri-Food Trade Commissioners in SE Asia is very pleased to provide you with our second edition of this quarterly newsletter highlighting our work finding opportunities for Canadian agri-food businesses in the 8 markets we serve.
A major development in the Region is the access of Vietnam to the World Trade Organization in January, 2007.
This brings this important trading partner under the umbrella of the rules-based trading organization, and will provide certain benefits to Canada in the areas of canola (oil, seed and meal), feed peas, wines and icewines.
Improvements in duties for pork and beef products and feed ingredients were also achieved in the accession negotiations.
Sometimes product is not available, but a response is still good business practice, as it also encourages future business when the potential customer enquires again when product may be available.
Please take a look at the material inside.
Our team reports on the successes of several companies, and you will note that the Region is certainly dynamic in scope.

Spotlight on
SINGAPORE
Some conclusions for Canada from this scenario:
• Singapore is ASEAN's most developed nation, with a well-developed consumer market underpinned by sophisticated middle and upper income groups.
Singapore currently has a population of about 4.2 million people.
Population growth is slow and is being supplemented by immigration.
The population is expected to grow to 5 million people by 2010.
Although young in profile, Singapore now has an ageing population.
23% of Singaporeans are aged 19 or younger and will be an important element of the consumer market in future.
The economy remains strongly growth oriented, but middle income consumer confidence is undermined by fears over job losses, which are a relatively new phenomenon in Singapore.
Over 8 million visitors arrive in Singapore every year, confirming Singapore’s reputation as a Regional transportation hub.
The food supply chain is modern and well developed with most food products now being purchased at supermarkets.
Culturally, wet markets still have some importance for those people who like to buy their fresh produce at these venues.
This situation has developed since the mid-1980s.
Singapore's economy is based on its prowess as a base for manufacturing industries and as a financial centre, but Singapore is facing problems arising from being a higher cost manufacturing base than other countries, e.g. China and Malaysia.
The Singapore government is in the process of restructuring the economic development focus in order to establish more jobs for its citizens and continued economic growth and prosperity in future.
Economic commentators forecast that Singapore should see positive economic development over the next 5 years under circumstances where there are no major shocks to the global economy.
When taken together under the developing ASEAN Free Trade Area and their longstanding historical links, Singapore, Brunei and neighbouring Malaysia can form the core of ASEAN's higher income group consumer market in future.
Under circumstances of positive economic development, by 2015, the middle and upper income consumers in these three countries could number up to 30 million people, a target market of similar size to Canada today.
Singapore and Brunei will continue to have strong demand for imported agri-food products and processed food and beverages.
Brunei's demand will continue to be supported by re-export trade from Singapore and, to a lesser extent, Malaysia.
The trend towards diet modernization that is fully evident in Singapore and Brunei today will increase demand for temperate climate commodities and food ingredients, e.g. wheat, feed materials, but the industries that use these products will probably not been based in Singapore or Brunei in the longer term.
AFTA, and the already well-established links with Malaysia, are likely to see both countries become even more reliant on Malaysian-based industries (probably owned by Singapore and Brunei businesses) for a broader range of foodstuffs than today.
This is already starting to happen in some industries, e.g. wheat flour, bread, dry noodles and, to a lesser extent, beer (though not Brunei) and some frozen foods.
SINGAPORE – PORK PRICES MAY RISE BY UP TO 20% The price of pork, which has been rising steadily over the past year, could jump because of a drought in one of Singapore's biggest suppliers, Australia.
But for now, retailers said they intend to absorb the price hike.
Supermarket chain FairPrice said it would hold the price of its chilled pork steady for as long as possible.
Current shelf prices range from $7 per kg of lean meat to about $15 for a kg of ribs.
Between January and October this year, more than 69,000 tonnes of pork were consumed here.
The drought has taken a toll on crops over the past year, with shortages causing September grain prices to skyrocket.
The APL spokesman added that wheat prices rose from A$14 (S$17) per tonne to A$242.
AGRI-FOOD NEWS FROM THE REGION - SINGAPORE SINGAPORE – ORGANIC FOOD BOOM BOOSTING SALES Sunny Singapore seems to be in the midst of an organic food craze.
The strong appetite for organic food - thanks to the growing number of wellness-minded consumers here and concerns over food safety - is seeing companies involved in natural eatables chewing on big-time success.
Among them is Cold Storage which opened the island's first organic supermarket, Naturally Marketplace, at VivoCity last year.
Naturally Marketplace offers nearly 1,000 organic product lines, ranging from milk to wines to cleaning aids.
Organic food in Cold storage has been enjoying steady, double-digit growth.
Historically, demand for organic products came mostly from the large Western expatriate communities, but recently, the demand for organic foods has expanded to include locals.
Health consultant Sim Nget Seer of Biogenic International told BT that demand is definitely growing 'judging by the number of organic retail outlets that have sprouted up recently'.
Ms Sim also felt that local consumers are becoming more health conscious, and this is partly a result of the increased number of healthcare talks which have raised their awareness about healthy diet.
According to Britain's Organic Monitor, the estimated retail sales for Singapore organic food market stood at about US$40 million last year.
Across Asia, the market size is set to hit close to US$1 billion this year, it added.
This is not surprising given the numerous articles of food safety crisis that consumers are bombarded with almost daily - including contaminated fish, listeria in ice, the bird flu (H5NI) virus and high levels of pesticides found in vegetables.

PRIMA OFFERS A TASTE OF SINGAPORE IN VANCOUVER FRANCHISING is Prima's launchpad for spreading its wings overseas - and Canada is a natural stop for the flour-based food group.
'Vancouver (on Canada's west coast) is a cosmopolitan city and there is growing interest among mainstream Canadians in pan-Asian cuisine,' says Lewis Cheng, general manager of Prima Food, the food manufacturing, licensing and franchising arm of the group.
He says the group's Prima Taste restaurants serve authentic Singapore food like laksa, prawn mee, mee siam and Hainanese chicken rice.
They constitute a unique version of pan-Asian cuisine as the food has evolved over the years 'through a confluence of the various culinary traditions and styles of our major races'.
'We believe that Canada's resident population would therefore be receptive to a pan-Asian restaurant concept like the Prima Taste restaurant,' Mr Cheng says.
Through a franchise agreement, Prima opened its first Canadian Prima Taste 'True Singapore Cuisine' concept restaurant in early October.
The Canadian franchisee is committed to open at least 10 Prima Taste restaurants in the country within the next five years.
Launched last year, the Prima Taste 'True Singapore Cuisine' restaurant franchise already has outlets in major cities like Vancouver, Shanghai and Beijing.
There are also restaurants in San Jose, in the United States; Jakarta and Bandung, in Indonesia, and Manila, in the Philippines.
'The next franchised outlets will be opening in Surabaya (Indonesia), Hangzhou (China), Taipei (Taiwan) and Colombo (Sri Lanka),' Mr Cheng discloses.
'The Prima Taste brand's mission is to serve authentic Singapore cuisine in the world,' he says.
'And we believe that through franchising, we will be able to work with local partners for the various target markets for optimum growth and results.'
Thanks to the franchise system, Mr Cheng says, Prima is on track to build a chain of Singapore restaurants around the world.
'Each restaurant will serve a wide variety of authentic Singapore cuisine that is consistently delicious anywhere in the world, providing a uniquely Singapore dining experience.'
Venturing into Canada is not without its problems.
'Because Canada is in a different time zone, operational support becomes more challenging and costly,' Mr Cheng says.
'In terms of regulatory requirements, we need to comply with their disclosure laws which can be tedious and costly.'
While there are restaurants in Canada which serve Malaysian, Thai and EastWest fusion food, he says there is no restaurant offering genuine Singapore food in Vancouver.
'This would provide for quality assurance and minimise any potential conflict, delays and miscommunication.'

AGRI-FOOD NEWS FROM THE REGION INDONESIAN LIVESTOCK FOOD INDUSTRIES SUFFER FROM MEAT BONE MEAL SHORTAGE The Indonesian poultry food industries are suffering from meat bone meal shortage as the import of the product is disrupted by rumour about illegal meat bone meal.
The Chairperson of the Association of Livestock Food Companies (GPMT) Budiarto Subijanto reveals that MBM stocks at companies' warehouses are diminishing, while the imported MBM at ports are hard to release.
"It has been a month Importers cannot release their MBM from ports since the Department of Agriculture has not given their permission," he informed yesterday.
To release MBM from ports, he continued, importers had to have Letter of Request for Livestock Food Import.
At the moment, thousands of containers of MBM are piling at ports as the Minister of Agriculture has yet signed a single letter of request.
"The Minister of Agriculture reasons that the Directorate General of Animal Husbandry has yet made any recommendation.
However, we have not been able to contact the Director General of Animal Husbandry [Mathur Riady] as he is going abroad at the moment," added Budiarto.
According to him, the imported MBM piling at ports had met the necessary requirements, such as bill of lading (B/L) import document, invoice, certificate of origin, and certificate of animal health.
He stated that the MBM products were imported from countries free from the food-and-mouth disease, such as New Zealand and Australia.
Outside of facing MBM or raw material shortage, livestock food industries also suffer from losses on the requirement to pay for US$15-US$30 per day per container in demorage fee (fine imposed on delays in getting imported goods from ports).
"A company has to spend IDR1.38 million-IDR2.7 million per container for 10 days in delay or around IDR4 million-IDR12 million per container per month," complained Budiarto.
Separately, Marketing Director of PT Sierad Produce Albert Sitorus disclosed that the company had to spend US$20 per container per day in demurrage fee since three weeks ago.
"As a result, we are forced to reduce our losses by burdening the additional costs to the customers [animal breeders]," said Albert.
According to him, if the MBM could not be released from ports, the livestock food companies would be forced to use poultry meat meals.As a consequence, inserted Albert, the prices of livestock food would soar as the use of poultry meat meals increase production costs up by IDR30,000 per kilogram.
The loan, supported by an additional 10 mln usd from the Vietnamese government, will fund research and training, new laboratory equipment in some institutes and education and information services for farmers in remote regions, the ADB said.
The communist country, which was a net rice importer in the late 1980s, is now the world's number two exporter of rice and coffee, and a major international supplier of tea, cashew nuts and rubber.
"Access to new technologies by farmers and agrobased enterprises is essential as Vietnam's agriculture is gradually shifting its focus from increased production volumes to increased production values," the ADB said.

MATERIAL IMPORTS HINDERING DEVELOPMENT OF ANIMAL FEED PROCESSORS Dependence on imported materials is laying heavy pressure on the Vietnamese animal feed processing sector, hindering it from gaining stable development and increasing competitiveness, according to the Association of Animal Feed under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
At present, import materials accounted for more than 54.6% of the sector’s total production value, equaling to VND9,300 billion for processing.
Vietnam in the past ten months of this year spent $671 million importing animal feed and materials for processing, an on-year rise of 30%.
AGRI-FOOD NEWS FROM THE REGION BID TO WIN OVER FUSSY BEEF BUYERS THE importance Asian consumers place on food taste and quality can be seen in the way meat is promoted and presented in supermarkets throughout Taiwan, Singapore and Japan.
Details on how the beef is produced features strongly on packaging, along with enticing messages about health benefits and taste.
The information is delivered to consumers via branding, with nearly all meat in Asian stores sold under a brand heavily promoted with stickers, posters and glossy brochures.
Common themes include "naturally fresh", "delicious and tasty", or "tender and succulent".
This is in stark contrast to Australian supermarkets, where most red meat is sold generically without brand names or detailed consumer information.
It is estimated that in Japan alone there are at least 200 different beef brands.
Every food imaginable in Japanese supermarkets appears to be branded and priced accordingly.
For example, one shop had a display of tomatoes that looked the same.
Depending on the brand, some were twice as expensive and shoppers were buying them.
Meat and Livestock Australia Japan manager Samantha Jamieson said the importance of product branding and image could not be underestimated in that market.
"Branding is so powerful in Japan," Ms Jamieson said.
Part of MLA's work in Asia is helping to develop and support meat brands promoted by Australian exporters or producer groups.
MLA southeast Asia and China regional manager Tim Kelf said the importance of branding in countries such as Taiwan and Singapore was slightly different to Japan, where the culture was image driven.
He said South-East Asian branding aimed at building customer loyalty and creating a product that had more value to retailers than just price.
In places such as Singapore, Australian beef had to compete against low-priced meat from Brazil or Indian buffalo.
Mr Kelf, who has worked in Asia for more than 20 years, said Australia couldn't compete at the lower end of the market on price so they worked to create relationships with higher-end retailers.
"In the mid 1980s, when Brazilian beef was allowed into Singapore, we went from selling 15,000 tonnes to 2500 tonnes the next year," he said.
"That's what happens when these guys come to town.
We lose the bottom end of the market because we can't compete.
That's why a lot of the work we do is based around brands and building customer loyalty."
VIETNAM’S LIVESTOCK SECTOR UNDER VARIOUS THREATS High feed prices, rampant pandemics, unplanned production and weak food hygiene and safety are threatening Vietnam's livestock production sector, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
The ministry's Livestock Production Department's (LPD) statistics show the price for 100 kilos of swine feed is $29.5 in Vietnam while it is $25.5 in Poland and Netherlands, $31 in China, $23 in Brazil, $19 in Canada and only $17.5 in the US.
The department also said that while the price level of pork in Vietnam is $0.80-$0.90 per kilo, the price level is $0.70-$0.80 per kilo in other countries in the region.
An employee of Metro Cash & Carry wholesale centre in Hanoi said the store had sold imported food since its opening in mid 2003 and had developed a customer base.
"Local people are quick to change their taste to foreign food, which is widely believed to ensure food hygiene and safety," he said.
While the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) shows concern over food hygiene and safety in all sectors, especially agricultural, local farmers seem to ignore this problem.
Experts warned that chicken and pork from Thailand and China will be imported into Vietnam in greater volumes post WTO entry because of geographical proximity.

AGRI-FOOD NEWS FROM THE REGION MALAYSIA - CAPTURING THE GLOBAL HALAL FOOD MARKET The Malaysian operations of the world's biggest food company are poised to play a leading role as Nestlé targets the fastgrowing halal food business.
Nestlé's current sales of halal products is in the region of US$5 billion to US$6 billion per annum.
Demand from consumers and sales of these food products should jump further as more Muslim governments take initiatives to encourage private sector participation in expanding the halal food business.
In the case of Malaysia, it has initiated an ambitious plan to turn the country into the world's premier halal hub.
At the same time, the international Muslim community is getting nearer in standardising and harmonising matters pertaining to halal manufacturing practices, certification and labelling of products.
Once the consolidation of these various certifications into one globally accepted halal standard and logo is achieved, the halal food trade is expected to grow exponentially.
Nestlé's halal-certified factories produce a range of products, including coffee and other beverages, culinary sauces and seasonings, noodles, breakfast cereals, shelf-stable dairy and non-dairy creamers, sweetened condensed milk, infant nutrition, confectionery, ice cream and performance nutrition.

VIETNAM’S WTO ENTRY OPENS DOORS TO FOREIGN MEAT More different kinds of foreign meat will be available in Vietnam in the post-WTO period, bringing more choices to Vietnamese housewives.
However, domestic chicken will be favored thanks to local customers' habits.
Director of a trading company in Ho Chi Minh City (HCM City) said that with the committed tax rates, chicken wings and legs will be imported to Vietnam which are 'soft' in prices.
Phu An Sinh Company's Director Pham Van Minh also said that there will be more and more foreign-made products, adding that imported chicken will be suitable for fast food.
However, Mr Minh said Vietnamese consumers will still favor domestic chicken, bred by households on a small scale.
Besides, Vietnamese consumers like buying chickens whole, while most foreign-sourced chickens are without heads.
"I'm planning to set up a new business, which will specialize in exporting chicken breasts and providing chicken legs and wings to fast food restaurants," Mr Minh said, adding that many fast food shops, like US based KFC in HCM City, will profusely consume the chicken material supply.
The 0% tax rate to be applied soon after Vietnam joins the WTO will help investors save investment expenses, which will lead to lower prices on different poultry meats in the time to come.
Meanwhile, analysts said foreign beef also could not overwhelm Vietnamese market after the country joins WTO because of its high prices.
Dinh Quoc Phong, a staff member of Metro, the biggest retailer in Vietnam, said that meat prices will decrease as a result of a profuse supply on the market.
However, foreign-sourced beef will be much higher than locally-made products, leaving locally made products the main choices of Vietnamese consumers.
Makro issued a statement saying its owners, the Netherlands-based SHV Holdings NV and other shareholders, had signed an agreement with Tesco Malaysia to sell its entire operations in Malaysia, which include a network of eight stores.

FOOD PRODUCTS MEAD JOHNSON EXPANDING - Thailand vies to win B4bn plant Thailand is among five countries Mead Johnson is considering for a new four-billion-baht powdered milk plant.
The plant, to be Asia's largest, would help support future growth in the region, according to Stephen Golsby, president of Mead Johnson Nutritionals.
Mr Golsby, who was in Bangkok yesterday, declined to identify the other countries, but said a decision on the investment would be made within the next six to 12 months.
Mead, the world's largest child nutrition manufacturer, would consider labour costs, infrastructure, domestic market demand and investment privileges in choosing a location.
The company operates powdered milk plants in the US, Mexico, Netherlands, China, the Philippines and Thailand.
About half of the Thai plant's production is sold locally, with the rest exported to Malaysia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
Mr Golsby said the company will invest more in Asia because it is the fastest growing region worldwide, with double-digit growth over the past several years.
Asia accounts for one-third of the company's global sales.
Thailand offered strong benefits, including a talented workforce, a competitive cost base and a favourable geographic location within the region, although transportation remained a weakness.
Mead Johnson will also officially open its new powdered milk line at its existing Chon Buri facility within the next several months.
The new facility will help increase its total capacity of powdered milk by 25%, including its Alacta-NF brand.

THAILAND MOAC TO SET UP PIG BOARD TO TACKLE PORK PRICE PROBLEM Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC), Yukol Limlamthong revealed that the ministry is expediting the establishment of Pig Board or the committee for swine and pork products development.
The Pig Board, which will be chaired by the MOAC Minister Thira Sutabutr, aims to resolve the problem of low pork prices.
The ministry speculates that the decrease on pork prices has caused in part by avian influenza.
During 2006, the pandemic has prompted farmers to raise swine instead of chicken, resulting in too much pork supply in the market.
As for a long-term solution, Mr Yukol said the ministry has cooperated with the Department of Internal Trade to help farmers sell pork and control swine breeding.

VIETNAM - After a lot of effort in working with the Vietnamese Department of Animal Health, post successfully assisted CFIA in obtaining the animal health certificates regarding export of avian, porcine and fish meat and bone meal as well as feather meal from Canada to Vietnam.
These certificates have become effective since October 25, 2006.
VIETNAM - Post also assisted CFIA in removing the new trade barrier from the Vietnamese government that requires DNA testing on imported meat & bone meal products to look for MBM contamination with ruminant material.
That being said all the above Canadian animal health certificates on export of meat & bone meal products to Vietnam remain unchanged for usage and there is no further requirements applied to Canada.
VIETNAM - After getting feedback from Metro Cash and Carry in Vietnam that McCain regional office in Malaysia did not respond to their enquiry, Bruce Howard and HOCHI Post recommended Metro deal directly with McCain HQ in Canada.
The firm, in collaboration with Sacammas Sdn Bhd, a leading local distributing company for scientific and chemical products and services, will be engaged in a project to analyse existing incentive programs and formulate new ones.
The contract signing ceremony for the New Agricultural and Agribusiness Incentive Programs for Brunei Darussalam project took place at the Department of Agriculture headquarters.
Signing on behalf of the Agriculture department was its acting director, Normah Suria Hayati PJDSMDSU Dr Awang Mohd Jamil al-Sufri, while the Canadian-based company was represented by its Project Manager, Neal Carter.
Present to witness the signing was the Acting Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Industry and Primary Resources, Pg Mariana PDNLDR Pg Abdul Momin.
Carter pointed out that the ever-changing global market for agri-and food-products, as well as the low self-sufficiency of the domestic agriculture sector, necessitated the assessment of existing incentive programs.
He also said that the programs had not taken into consideration human resource requirements, impact on quality of life and eventual self-reliance.
In addition, analyses of the department's programs would help identify and develop niche export-oriented products such as halal products, which the project manager recognised as one of the sultanate's focal strategies in promoting the economy.
The Agriculture Department hopes that the project would evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency and appropriateness of its current programs to meet national and the department's objectives, and to formulate new incentive programs.
The current programs were designed to enhance the agrobased processing sector, to attract more private sector involvement in agribusiness and in general to meet the country's economic diversification goal.
Agrodev has conducted several projects for the Department of Agriculture since 1998, the latest of which was completed in 2004.
The project, which will be carried out in three phases, is expected to be initiated this month and completed by June 2007 with the handing over of the final report.

Market Information Southeast Asia Halal Meat Study Brunei Darussalam Canadian High Commission Brunei 2006
OVERVIEW Brunei is a small country with an area the size of Prince Edward Island and a population of about 370,000.
The population is predominantly Malay and a minority of Chinese as well as other racial groups.
The Islamic faith is devoutly held in Brunei, hence, the religious requirements regarding the slaughter and consumption of halal meat are extremely important.
To ensure the supply of fresh halal meat (beef), in 1987, the Brunei Government has acquired Scott Creek/Willeroo Station covering 5,986 sq. kilometres in Northern Territory, Australia.
Apart from the cattle stock in Northern Territory, Brunei also produces about 1,200 head of cattle for the market annually.
Research has been carried out to ascertain the best possible way to increase the local cattle population.
The Agriculture Department has launched a research project covering 6,874 hectares in the Tutong District designated for the livestock production industry.
The farm's main aim will be to assess local and imported stock towards producing highbred cattle for commercial purposes.
According to official figures, there are 115 poultry farmers in the country.
Brunei consumed 16.5 metric tons of chicken in 2005, of which, 93.5% is bred locally and the rest is imported from neighbouring countries.
DEFINITIONS OF HALAL, HARAM AND MUSBOOH The Quran has numerous rules instructing Muslims to choose and consume wholesome foodstuffs.
In the selection of food and drink, Islam has laid down three very important guidelines: 1.
HALAL Halal is a Quranic term which means 'permitted, allowed, authorised, approved, sanctioned or lawful'.
Halal foods and drinks are permitted for consumption by Allah - the Supreme law giver.
In Brunei, approval is given by the Halal Authority (Brunei Islamic Religious Council, Ministry of Religious Affairs) through The Board For Issuing Halal Import Permits for products that satisfy the halal requirements.
Islam has introduced the concept of slaughter, whereby an animal would have to be properly slaughtered to be considered halal.
The act of slaughtering is to ensure the quality of meat and to avoid any microbial contamination.
For example, a dead but unslaughtered animal is normally associated with disease.
Most disease originate from animal's blood, therefore, slaughtering is mandatory to ensure that complete drainage of blood from the animal's body - thus, minimizing the chance of microbial infection.
This is compatible with the overall concept of cleanliness that is always emphasised in Islam.
HARAM Haram is a Quranic term which means 'prohibited or unlawlful'.
All foods are considered Halal except the following :
• Swine/pork/dog and its by-products;
• Alcohol and intoxicants;
• Carnivorous animals, birds of prey and land animals without external ears;
• Amphibious animals such as frogs, crocodiles and turtles;
• Animals improperly slaughtered or dead before slaughtering;
• Food contaminated with any of the above products (The Halal ingredients must not be mixed, or even come into contact with Haram materials, such as products from pig or dog, during storage, transport, cooking, serving, etc.;
• Foods containing ingredients such as gelatin, enzymes, emulsifiers, etc. are Musbooh or questionable.
MUSBOOH Musbooh is an Arabic term which means 'suspected'.
If one does not know the Halal or Haram status of a particular food or drink, such a food or drink is doubtful.
A GUIDE TO EXPORTING MEAT TO BRUNEI Any person with the intention to export meat to Brunei will have to produce a Slaughtering Certificate issued by the Director of Syariah, of the Brunei Ministry of Religious Affairs.
The person importing the meat shall have to apply for a 'Halal Import Permit' from the Controller of Customs under the Board for Issuing Import Permits.
Whenever any halal meat is imported, authorised officers from the Ministry of Health and the Agriculture department will examine it and certify it fit for human consumption.
The Inspection Committee shall ensure that meat must only be imported from countries where animals are free from dangerous and contagious diseases and where only local animals are slaughtered.
Lastly, the importers and local suppliers of halal meat must be Muslims.
GUIDELINES FOR HALAL SLAUGHTER To obtain a Slaughtering Certificate one shall apply to the Director of Syariah Affairs at the Ministry of Religious Affairs.
An Inspection Committee shall ensure that:
• the slaughtering centre must be under close and constant supervision of a Halal Certifier.
• the slaughterers must be mature and pious Muslim of sound mind who understands fully the fundamentals and conditions relating to Halal slaughter.
• for a foreign slaughtering centre, the slaughterers must be Muslims duly authorised by the law of that country to slaughter animals according to the Syariah Law.
• the animals must be alive in normal condition when slaughtered.
• the premises, machinery and equipment must be cleansed according to the Syariah Law.
• all slaughtering devices must be of good quality and sharp and they must not be made from bones, fingernails, toenails or teeth.
• facilities must be available for rinsing the knife after each slaughter.
• when slaughtering, the respiratory tract ('halqum') and the channel for taking in food and water ('mari') must be cut off according to the Syariah Law.
• the phrase 'In the name of Allah' (Bismillah) must be called forth during slaughtering of the animal.
• if stunning is used during the slaughtering process, these procedures must be followed: (a) stunning will result in the animal being temporarily unconscious (b) the stunner is of a type which cannot penetrate or break the animal's head (c) it must not cause permanent brain damage or give rise to death or physical disability to the animal.
• the animal must be completely dead before skinning takes place.
• Muslim workers must be present at the time of removal and separation of the organs of the slaughtered animals.
• the halal meat shall be kept separately from non-halal meat at all times, in every slaughtering centre, place for storage, packing, during transportation, importation and during sale.
After being satisfied that the applicant is capable of slaughtering animals according to the Syariah Law, the Director of Syariah Affairs will issue a Slaughtering Certificate.
All the expenses incurred on the inspection of the slaughtering centre by the Inspection Committee shall be borne by the slaughtering centre/importer.

Market Information Southeast Asia AFMA:
A New Lease on Life*
Senen U. Reyes Senior Management Specialist Center for Food and Agri Business University of Asia and the Pacific
After the country's accession to the World Trade Organization in  1995, there was a lot of apprehension and anxiety among the different sectors of Philippine society.
This was formalized with the passage in 1996 of Republic Act (RA) 8178 known as the Agricultural Tariffication Act, which provided for the replacement of quantitative restrictions on agricultural products with tariffs.
If one is to go by the sentiments of farmers and cause-oriented groups, that move was premature and there was much to lose in trade liberalization.
On the other hand, the more progressive sectors saw this as a step towards opportunities in the global market.
Enabling Mechanisms The former sentiment was all the more felt in the agriculture and fishery sector with the Philippines being an agriculture-based economy.
Given that poverty is highest in the agricultural sector, the government had to allay the fears of farmers and fisherfolks.
As an immediate response to the perceived negative effects of liberalization, the Agricultural Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (ACEF) was set in place together with the tariffication act.
The fund shall be set aside and earmarked by congress for irrigation, farm-to-market roads, post-harvest equipment and facilities, credit, research and development, other marketing infrastructure, provision of market information, retraining, extension services, and other forms of assistance and support to the agricultural sector.
Another legislative measure enacted was the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act of 1997 (AFMA or RA 8435).
Senator Angara during his stint as DA Secretary in 1999 had this to say:
After seven years of implementation and seven DA secretaries from its approval, the agriculture and fisheries sector is still struggling.
The amendment with its longer prescriptive period seems to be a manifestation that the intent of the law has not been met.
If it is any consolation, the amendment already explicitly states that the amount appropriated for AFMA shall be in addition to the annual budget of the DA.
However, the additional funding requirement remains to be seen as the 2006 government budget has not been approved.
Prior to the AFMA, there was supposed to be a budget for safety nets to the tune of P74 billion to address concerns related to the country's accession to the GATT-WTO.
The DA's annual budget was around P15 billion broken into the regular and GATT related activities.
With the AFMA, the average annual budget stood at almost the same level but the GATT term was replaced by AFMA.
The additional money provided by law was nowhere in sight i.e. P20 billion in the first year and P17 billion for the succeeding six years.
The Backbone According to then Secretary Angara, "there are two main outstanding concepts in AFMA that sort of tie up all its various elements, and if correctly implemented would totally transform the agricultural landscape.
First is the bottom-up planning and implementation of programs with the involvement of all stakeholders under the principal leadership of local government units (LGUs).
The second is the concept of Strategic Agriculture and Fisheries Development Zones (SAFDZs) or food baskets."
On the first point, agriculture and fishery programs are still planned and implemented from the top to bottom since bulk of the funds and resources are channeled through national government agencies.
AFMA's very important concept of the SAFDZs was intended to rationalize the allocation and use of the remaining and available agricultural lands in the country and to set aside strategically-located prime lands for the modernization of agriculture and fishery sectors.
Unfortunately, the SAFDZ concept as a "food basket" or food center as others would prefer to call it, has been too associated with monetary considerations.
This perception stemmed from government pronouncements that it is in these zones where the bulk of government's scarce funds for agriculture and fisheries would be concentrated.
Thus, these zones are convergence areas for total agro-industrial development, where concerned national government agencies will pour much needed infrastructure, technical, credit, and marketing support services.
This resulted to the inclusion in some identified SAFDZs of entire areas of barangays and municipalities which were not strategically-located prime lands for agriculture and fisheries modernization.
The thinking was that the more SAFDZs, the more money for the LGU.
This also led to the delay in the delineation and identification of SAFDZ which should have been finished within one year from the effectivity of the AFMA law but was completed in 2001.
The Bureau of Soils and Water Management completed the preparation of SAFDZ maps and the digitization of regional maps and some provincial/municipal SAFDZ maps.
It is also reported that as of September 2002, 91% of all municipalities have prepared Sangguniang Bayan resolution adopting the SAFDZ.
However, there are claims that the SAFDZs are not being utilized as intended since the maps are difficult to interpret at the LGU level; there was lack of consultation with stakeholders on their identification and there is still land conversion despite the SAFDZs.
The SAFDZs were hardly used as a planning and implementation tool to maximize productivity, promote efficiency and equity and accelerate modernization.
Rice as an AFMA Barometer Since rice is the country's major staple and receives the most support from the government through its banner programs, it may give an indicative picture of AFMA's influence from the pre-AFMA to the post-AFMA years.
Palay production has been increasing over the last twelve years with growth averaging 4.9%.
However, the severest El Niño that hit the country in 1998 caused production to decline by 24% although recovery was made in the following years with sustained growth.
Growth over the pre-AFMA years (1993-1997) without the effect of the severe El Niño averaged 4.7% which was slightly above the growth during the post AFMA years (1999-2004) at 4.2%.
Area harvested over the pre-AFMA years grew by 4.1% annually excluding the year 1998 when it dropped by 17.5%.
During the post AFMA years, area hardly moved at 0.6% growth and stood at four million hectares from 1999-2004.
PALAY:
Production and Area Harvested, 1993-2004 Source of basic data:
BAS Considering 1993 as a reference year, it would be noted that succeeding productions were all above the base year at an increasing rate except for 1998 due to the severe El Niño phenomenon.
RICE:
Production Index, 1993-2004 Source of basic data:
BAS In terms of regional distribution, five regions account for almost 60% of total production led by Central Luzon, Western Visayas, Cagayan Valley and the Ilocos.
There has been no considerable change in production distribution among the regions in the pre- and post-AFMA years.
BAS Production growth during the post AFMA years has been largely due to the sustained growth of yield averaging 3.6% during the period compared to the 0.5% growth from 1993-1997.
The post AFMA years were characterized by the intensified campaign on the use of hybrid and inbred seeds.
Average Yield, 1993-2004 Source:
BAS The Philippines is still a net importer of rice despite the mandate of AFMA for self-sufficiency.
There were minimal imports in 1993-1995 but a sharp surge was experienced in 1996 likely caused by the El Niño phenomenon in 1995.
Imports peaked in 1998 at two million tons as a result of the severe El Niño and again reached over one million tons in 2002.
Rice imports during the pre-AFMA period averaged 690,000 tons which grew to an average 840,000 tons from 1999-2004.
Total import expenditure amounted to US$1.27 billion and US$1.13 billion during the pre-AFMA and post-AFMA period, respectively.
Total imports for 2005 reached 1.8 million tons while in 2006, imports are projected at 1.2 million tons.
Comparing the volume indices, it can be seen that there have not been enough spikes in production to abate the seeming periodic surges in imports following the occurrence of an extreme weather disturbance such as the El Niño.
Production and Import Volume Index, 1993-2004 Source of basic data:
BAS and NSO Given the pre and post AFMA rice situation, while there is an absolute increase in production basically coming from yield growth, this has not been enough to address the growing demand as reflected from rising imports.
The interventions provided by the law seemingly have not had as much impact as intended due to reasons such as lack of funds and non-implementation of several important provisions.
The AFMA as provided in the law itself is currently under review by a team of experts who have set out to evaluate the implementation of the law given its various components.
It is hoped that the review as well as the extension of the mandated funding support to 2015 will provide the impetus to turn around agriculture and fishery towards modernization and competitiveness.

The Pitch for Bio-Fuels The growing thrust towards a cleaner and greener environment  has led to the search for more renewable sources of fuel and energy.
The advent of the Kyoto Protocol and its concomitant effects of carbon trading have provided impetus to renewed interest in biofuels.
Biofuels are increasingly used in many countries for environmental and economic reasons.
Two of the more popular bio-fuels are ethanol and biodiesel for gasoline and diesel engines, respectively.
Ethanol is a high octane renewable fuel which can be produced from a number of different feedstocks like sugarcane, corn, cassava and other crops.
Meanwhile, biodiesel production uses domestic raw materials from coconut, oil palm, jatropha, used cooking oil and other biomass sources.
Thus a significant multiplier can cut across the supply chain from growing to manufacturing and logistics.
The requirement for locally grown feedstocks will increase utilization of agricultural land, promote investment, and create jobs.
Biodiesel is also an environment-friendly product that dramatically cuts emissions.
At the same time, with the rising cost of crude oil, the economics of biodiesel has become somewhat favorable.
Moreover, the production of biodiesel can save foreign exchange, a scarce resource in a developing country.
The development of biofuels has found even more relevance given the continuing uncertainties of Middle East supply as well as those of other major oil fields and the rising petroleum-based fuel prices.
A recent study reviewed by the Wall Street Journal revealed that the world's biggest producing field, Saudi Arabia's Ghawar, is possibly declining in output.
In addition, Mexico's Cantarell oil field, which is the world's second largest will be declining at a significant rate in the next few years.
Agricultural Implications These are but a few reasons for the much talked about alternative fuel or biofuels.
How will this shape the agricultural landscape?
On a general note, higher demand for ethanol and biodiesel due to the oil crisis would have a positive effect on agriculture given the opportunities in terms of value adding for traditional crops.
On the other hand, it would put pressure on the production of agricultural feedstocks particularly on sugarcane, corn, cassava, coconut, and oil palm.
It raises the issues of how much additional areas can be planted and the competing uses for food, feeds, and fuel.
Ethanol Based on an average annual gasoline consumption of four billion liters, the government is proposing an initial mix of 5% ethanol to 95% gasoline over the next two years.
This will require an annual production of 200 million liters of ethanol which translates to 2.35 million tons of sugarcane or 500,000 tons of corn or 1.25 million tons of cassava (Table 1).
Estimates indicate that if the feedstock requirements were to be supplied from existing production in 2004, sugarcane and corn will have to give up nine percent each while cassava will entail a substantial 76% of production to support the fuel ethanol program (Table 2).
Modes to Cover Feedstock Requirement
Sugarcane Corn Cassava A. From existing production
Yield (tons/ha) 65.82 2.14 7.97 Additional area (ha) 35,727 234,819 156,838 C. From increased productivity
BAS, CFA-UAP estimates Over the past five years, 2004 has been the highest production year for sugarcane and corn while it has also been a good year for cassava (Table 3).
Historically, there have been no regular surges in production.
This would mean that a higher percentage will be required for the other years which would put added pressure on the raw material supply for other uses like sweeteners, food grain, feeds, starch, and alcohol.
The competing uses will likely boil down to a question of who gives a better farmgate price.
BAS If the requirement were to be produced from an expansion in area harvested, sugarcane will need 36,000 hectares, corn 235,000 hectares, and cassava 157,000 hectares.
Based on the incremental increases from year to year, there have been no area expansions in all three crops which would approximate the required feedstock (Table 4).
This is especially true for cassava which needs an additional three quarters of the current area.
However, the sugar industry has already identified more than 100,000 hectares for sugarcane plantings to support ethanol production enough for a 10% blend.
BAS The third option of generating the feedstock requirement from increased productivity on existing areas is relatively a tall order given the yield performance of the three crops over the past several years (Table 5).
While sugarcane has been the better yield performer among the three, it has not reached a 9% yield increment required for the desired volume.
This is true also for corn and cassava which need 9% and 76% yield increments, respectively to meet the requirements.
The incremental yields for sugarcane have been around 5% in three of the past four years while corn yield increments have been 6% and 12% in 2003-2004.
Source of basic data:
BAS
Biodiesel In terms of biodiesel, the government proposal is for a 1% blend of biodiesel to 99% petroleum diesel.
At an estimated diesel demand of seven billion liters, the country will need 70 million liters or kg of biodiesel/methyl ester (Table 6).
This can be supplied from two basic feedstocks: coconut oil and palm oil.
The required quantity of feedstock to get a kilogram or liter of biodiesel is almost the same for both types of oil.
The big difference lies in the yield advantage of palm oil over coconut oil which reduces the oil palm area needed to generate the entire requirement.
It has the highest production and yield which would need lesser land for expansion.
Its productivity has been continuously improving over the years with an industry target of 75 tons cane.
A distinct advantage of sugarcane is its industry structure which is highly organized and consolidated with strong private sector involvement.
The sugar industry has been bullish about the ethanol potential so much so that it has identified the specific areas for expansion and is supporting the establishment of ethanol plants.
However, this can work to the Philippine advantage by using palm oil for the domestic market while bringing the coconut oil to the export market.
As a final note, the test of ethanol and biodiesel would be the market acceptability in terms of pump price which would be the first consideration of consumers and the expected benefits to the vehicle, environment, and agriculture.
Biofuels will give the otherwise traditional crops a boost towards value added processing.

Market Information Southeast Asia The Philippine Feeds Industry*
Florence M. Sevilla Senior Agribusiness Specialist Center for Food and Agri Business  University of Asia and the Pacific
The feed industry serves primarily the livestock, poultry, and aquaculture sub-sectors.
For the livestock sector, hog is the most important consumer of feeds as cattle and goats are raised primarily on roughages.
Poultry feed production, on the other hand, is mainly for chicken and duck.
Initially, aquaculture feeds have been considered a minor sub-sector of the feedmilling industry but today, the production of fish feeds is the fastest growing feed market.
Table 1 shows the mixed feed production volume in the Philippines from 2000-2005 based on data from the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI).
As of December 2005, a total of 395 commercial feedmillers were registered with BAI with an aggregate capacity of 23,470 tons/day based on an 8-hour work shift.
Of these, 86% are geographically located in Luzon, while 8% are in the Visayas and 6% in Mindanao.
Some feedmills can be found in the National Capital Region and the surrounding provinces of Southern Tagalog and Central Luzon.
These three regions account for 66% of national rated capacity.
Feed Production, 2000-2005 Year Production (in tons) 2005* 1,940,962 2004 3,048,000 2003 2,975,000 2002 2,951,448 2001 2,081,049 2000 1,768,604 *Partially consolidated as of December 2005 Based on the size of registered operations, there are 244 small feedmills (< 25 tons/8-hr shift), 50 medium-scale (25.1-50 tons/8-hr shift), and 101 large-scale operations (>50 tons/8-hr shift).
The top 10 establishments represent approximately half of the national commercial feed manufacturing capacity.
Poultry and livestock feed production Poultry and livestock feeds accounted for 85% of the total feeds produced which amounted to almost two million tons in 2005 (Table 2).
Of this, 61% was allocated for poultry and 39% for the hog sector.
Chicken feeds are mainly consumed in the provinces of Batangas, Bulacan and Pampanga, while pig feeds are in greatest demand in Bulacan, Cebu and Batangas.
Aquaculture feed production Total aquaculture feed production in 2005 was estimated at 52,000 tons, consisting mainly of milkfish, tilapia, and shrimp feeds (Table 2).
Milkfish farms are mostly located in Pangasinan and Bulacan.
Tilapia feed demand is high in Luzon, particularly from Taal Lake, Magat Dam, Pantabangan Dam, and several small lakes in Laguna Province.
As for the shrimp feed market, this has shrunk substantially from over 25,000 tons in 1995 to about 4,000 tons in 2005.
Consumption was highest in the Visayas, particularly in Negros Occidental, while some are consumed in Mindanao, mainly in Agusan del Norte and South Cotabato.
Luzon consumption had decreased considerably due to the many disease problems plaguing the shrimp farming industry; majority of the farmers have either ceased operation or have shifted production to intensive milkfish culture.
Most companies offer a single feed formulation for the culture of milkfish, tilapia, catfish, and carp, conceivably to reduce inventory cost and simplify stock management.
It is interesting to note that most of the shrimp feed manufacturers in the country have had at one time or another some form of partnership with Taiwanese aquafeed companies.
Major feed ingredients The major feed ingredients used in aquaculture feeds in the country are limited to about seven to ten, the majority of which are imported.
Aquaculture feeds currently utilize about 40-60% imported raw materials for fish feeds and 85-95% imported raw materials for shrimp feeds, as compared to only 20-30% for livestock and poultry feeds.
Four ingredients can be said to have serious competing uses, these being soybean oil meal, rice bran, fishmeal, and wheat by-products.
By contrast, all the soybean oil meal is imported, while limited amounts of fish meal and meat and bone meal are produced locally.
Wheat and its by-products, on the other hand, are produced by local flour mills from imported grains.
Rice bran and copra meal are sourced exclusively in the country.
Yellow corn Corn is the second most important agricultural crop in the country with total output of 5.3 million tons in 2005.
The major corn growing provinces are Isabela in Luzon, and Bukidnon, North Cotabato, Lanao del Sur, and Maguindanao in Mindanao.
Yellow corn is used as a major raw material for poultry feeds and pig feeds while white corn is produced mainly for human food (it is the staple cereal in several provinces in Central and Eastern Visayas, and in parts of Mindanao) although it is also sometimes used as a feedstuff for pigs and poultry.
In fish feeds, yellow corn is rarely used and if so, only in small quantities.
Soybean meal Soybean meal is the most widely used high protein plant feed ingredient.
The Philippines is dependent on foreign supply with imports in 2004 totaling more than a million tons.
The extent of utilization of soybean in feeds is affected by world market prices.
For the last five years, importation has fluctuated from a low of 866,000 tons in 2005 to a high of 1.3 million tons in 2002.
Although the Philippines has vast tracts of land ideal for producing soybean, production and transport costs are relatively high, making local production presently uncompetitive.
Rice bran The Philippines produced an average of 9.7 million tons per year of paddy from 2000 to 2005, with production coming mainly from the provinces of Nueva Ecija and Isabela in Luzon, Iloilo and Negros Occidental in the Visayas, and Zamboanga del Sur and Bukidnon in Mindanao.
In terms of rice bran, this amounted to 970,000 tons annually (at 10% of the paddy weight).
As rice is a seasonal crop, then so is the availability of rice bran which has a peak supply during the fourth quarter.
This trend is closely associated with the supply of irrigation water from the monsoon rains which favor harvesting during the late third quarter and the last quarter of the year.
The lean months are observed between the first and third quarters when it is dry in many provinces.
Fish meal Despite the country's vast natural fishery resources, the animal feedmilling industry depends heavily on imported fishmeal.
Total fishmeal imports in 2004 amounted to 111,000 tons mainly form Peru.
Fishmeal imports have increased by 80% since 1990s, with Peruvian fishmeal being the most commonly used fishmeal for livestock, poultry, and fish feeds.
The other types of imported fish meal, which are typically used for shrimps, include Chilean, American, Alaskan, Canadian, Japanese, brown, and white fish meal.
Compared to other major feedstuffs, the tariff on fish meal imports is at 3%.
Unfortunately, there is no record of local fishmeal production which depends mainly on the use of tuna cannery rejects and by-products.
The bulk of tuna fishmeal is produced in General Santos, the location of the five largest tuna canning plants in the country.
Sardine canneries also generate large quantities of fish by-products but only a small portion of this is processed into fish meal due to its high oil content.
The bulk of these fish waste end up in the production of local fish sauces.
Sardine canneries are mainly located in Metro Manila, a number can be found in Cebu and Zamboanga.
There are a total of eight tuna canneries and at least nine major sardine canneries throughout the country.
The prospects of a fish meal manufacturing industry are even more uncertain today with increasingly limiting fish resources.
Wheat and by-products Wheat supply into the country is all imported.
A total of 200,000 tons of unmilled wheat was imported from the China, India, Australia and Canada in 2004.
Approximately 80-85% of the wheat imports are used for flour production and 15% milled for use in animal feeds.
Feedwheat is being taxed at 5% as this competes with local corn, while the import tariff for breadwheat is only at 3%.
Copra meal The Philippines is the world's largest coconut producer and supplies much of the demand of copra meal around the globe.
In 2004, some 38 tons of unmilled copra were exported entirely to China.
The volume of copra meal utilized locally for feeds is estimated to be at least 600,000 tons per year.
Other Ingredients Vitamins and mineral additives used in animal feeds are all imported with the exception of some natural mineral supplements such as calcium phosphates and oyster shell.
For livestock and poultry feeds, commercial vitamin premixes are widely available even for retail sale due to the numerous small non-commercial feed millers in the country.
By contrast, fish and shrimp premixes are uncommon due to the limited market and also because many aquafeed millers import their requirements directly.
Some shrimp feed manufacturers which have Taiwanese partners usually obtain their premixes directly from Taiwan although details of the premix composition are usually not disclosed for proprietary reasons.
At present, local production of animal oils for use in feeds is minimal and generally poor in quality.
Sardine cannery waste and fat trimmings from abattoirs are major resources of potential value to the feed industry.
However, manufacturers have to first properly source raw materials and invest in good handling and processing equipment.
Marketing and Distribution Being archipelagic in nature, the distance of many of the country's islands makes a multi-level marketing channel inevitable and this significantly adds to the cost of local feeds and feedstuffs.
Imported feed ingredients are channeled from the importer to wholesaler (which may be the same entity) to the distributor and dealers.
However, local feed ingredients such as corn, rice bran, and copra meal pass through a more intricate marketing channel, originating from the farmer or miller through several levels of traders before reaching the feedmiller.
Fish and shrimp feeds are usually packed in woven polypropylene (PP) bags provided with an inner polyethylene (PE) lining.
All feed companies pack grower and finisher fish feeds in 25 kilogram (kg) bags since quite a number of farmers compute their feed inputs in terms of bags rather than kilograms.
Mash feeds are packed either in 5 or 10-kg PE-lined PP bags while crumbled feeds are packed in 10 or 20-kg PE-lined PP bags.
Feed bags are mechanically sealed by stitching.
By contrast, livestock and poultry feeds are usually packed in 50-kg woven PP bags with no inner lining.
Fish feeds are normally marketed from the manufacturer to a network of distributors, dealers, and even sub-dealers due to the distance of many fish farms.
However, large feed manufacturers like Vitarich, Universal Robina, and San Miguel which have established company-owned distribution channels for poultry and livestock feeds, are usually able to market directly to the sub-dealer level or consumer level.
By contrast, other feed companies tap the marketing networks of provincial and municipal traders.
For shrimp feeds, the marketing channel is simpler since farms are never too far from a city or major town; from the manufacturer (or importer), the channel passes only through a distributor then directly to the farmer.
In general, each level of trader from the farmer to the distributor makes 5-10% profit, while dealers and retailers who sell directly to the end user make a margin of 10-15%.
From the source of the raw material (i.e. farmer, miller, or importer) up to the feed manufacturer, the marketing cost including the cost of transport adds from at least 30% to 80% on to the acquisition cost; the farther the feed miller from the source the higher is its cost of feedstuffs.
For this reason, large feed manufacturers often have personnel, agents, or direct suppliers at the trading area, allowing them to substantially cut down their raw material cost which small feedmillers are unable to do.
Feeds are generally marketed in cash or in credit terms of 30-60 days, with cash purchases given attractive discounts.
In the case of shrimp feeds, the stiff competition over the remaining market has forced some companies to offer credit terms in excess of 60 days.
The pricing of manufactured feeds in general is affected by the import price of the major feedstuffs such as soybean oil meal and wheat, and the seasonal availability of local feed ingredients.
At times when the supply is tight, it is not uncommon for feedstuff suppliers to require feedmillers to book and pay for their orders in advance.
Outlook Feed production by small-scale and backyard operations are consequently almost totally unaccounted for.
Moreover, it has not been possible to establish an official figure for the size of the entire feed manufacturing industry in the Philippines since only commercial operations are registered with the Government, and the registration of non-commercial feed milling is currently only voluntary.
Furthermore, it is common practice for some feedmillers (as well as farmers and other business entities) to understate their actual production for various reasons.
For many years now, various government institutions have been promoting the production of home-mixed feeds for poultry, livestock, and fish.
The prospect of producing home-mixed feeds to reduce feed cost are attractive not only for large-scale farming operations but also for farms that are located in distant rural areas, where hauling cost is high, the supply of commercial feeds is irregular, and the freshness of feeds is generally lower.
However, home-mixer feedmills for aquaculture have failed to prosper in the country, and this can be explained by the: (a) high cost and erratic supply of raw materials, (b) high capital requirement, and (c) lack of equipment designed for small-scale operation.
In the open market, traders of feed ingredients also tend to be more accommodating as far as credit is concerned to clients who purchase in large quantities whereas small purchases usually have to be paid in cash.
Furthermore, during lean months or shortage in raw material, it is almost always the large feedmiller that is prioritized by the trader.
Many non-commercial poultry and livestock feed manufacturers for these reasons are already shifting back to the use of commercial feeds which is turning out to be more practical and economical.
The country's Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan for 2004-2010 aims to increase aquaculture production by developing 16,000 hectares of new areas (including seaweeds), while for livestock, the target is 45,000 hectares of new lands.
New areas for development are projected to expand the feed market for aquaculture by at least 5%.
The poultry and livestock sectors, on the other hand, have been registering annual growth rates of at least 6% with broiler chicken production expected to grow by as much as 4% in 2006.
These developments and growth targets will, therefore, exert tremendous pressure on the country's feed resources in the not so distant future.

Market Information Southeast Asia A Bite of the Biscuits and Cookies Market in the Philippines*
Ronald Mark G. Omaña Researcher  Center for Food and Agri Business  University of Asia and the Pacific 2006
Described as small, flat-baked cake, biscuits and cookies are popular baked products that satisfy the consumers' "in-between" meal hunger.
The harder and more brittle products are referred to as biscuits while the softer and chewier ones are called cookies.
Market The latest Family Income and Expenditure Survey (2003) of the National Statistics Office (NSO) found that the total household spending on biscuits has reached P4.4 billion, lower by 6.4% from P4.7 billion in 2000.
The 2003 figure is slightly higher than the P4.3 billion posted in 1997.
Total Household Spending on Biscuits and Cookies,  Selected Years Source:
National Statistics Office (NSO) According to the NSO, the share of total household spending on food to total expenditures slightly dropped from 43.6% in 2000 to 42.6% in 2003 while the share of transportation and communications spending (e.g. phone and cell phone cards, etc.) improved from a share of 6.8% in 2000 to 7.4% in 2003.
Total Household Spending on Biscuits by Region, 2003 Source:
NSO Data from research firm ACNielsen showed that for the period Nov/Dec 2002 to Sept/Oct 2003 versus Nov/Dec 2003 to Sept/Oct 2004, biscuit was one of the ten leading food categories which posted high growth rates based on sales volume equivalent to 16.2%.
This strong sales volume performance makes the industry attractive to investors.
Players As explained by Palma in the October 2000 Food and Agri Business Monitor article entitled "Crunching Into the Biscuits and Cookies Market", industry players are divided into three groups: large manufacturers, neighborhood bakers, and the cottage or backyard producers.
The large manufacturers are the ones which produce majority of the popular biscuit and cookie brands found in leading groceries and supermarkets.
Meanwhile, the neighborhood bakeries usually produce biscuits and cookies that are sold on a per piece basis while the cottage or backyard producers make specialty biscuits and cookies using traditional original recipes and are normally sold personally to friends and neighbors.
These include companies which are also known to produce other food products directly or through their affiliates such as Monde Nissin Corporation, Republic Biscuit Corporation (Rebisco), and Universal Robina Corporation (URC).
Aside from the local manufacturers, there are also companies which buy imported brands such as Keebler, Danone, Nabisco's Chips Ahoy!, Oreo and Ritz, among others, and distribute/sell the same to the local market.

Supermarket Check, July 2006 Data for eight key players in the industry in 2003 showed that sales reached P3.8 billion.
The figure excludes yet sales data for market leader Monde Nissin Corporation and also for URC.
This suggests that the industry could be worth more than the P4.4 billion estimate of the NSO.

Overall, Monde Nissin Corporation and Monde M.Y. San Corporation are estimated to hold 40% of the entire biscuits and cookies market while Rebisco captures 25%, URC, 16%, while the other companies share in the remaining 19% of the market.
By product type, sources say crackers (Sky Flakes, Magic Flakes, Bluskies, etc.) are the best selling variety followed by sweet biscuits (e.g. Eggnog, Marie, etc.), and wafers (e.g. Tini Wini, etc.).
Trade From 2000 to 2003, the Philippines was a net importer of biscuits and cookies.
By 2004 until 2005, however, exports managed to outpace imports.
Philippine Trade of Biscuits and Cookies, 2001-2005 (Volume in tons; Value in '000 US$ - FOB for Exports; CIF for Imports)
National Statistics Office
Biscuit exports consistently increased from 2,400 tons in 2001 amounting to US$6M to about 9,200 tons worth US$22M in 2005 due mainly to the increased purchases of buyers like South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, and New Zealand.
Exports grew by an average of 41% per year while value increased by an average of 38% per year.
The five leading country-markets for Philippine biscuits in 2005 were South Korea, accounting for 33% of the entire export volume.
Japan was the second-largest with 16%, followed by the United States (11%), Taiwan (9%), and Canada (4%).
Total export volumes of cookies from 2001 to 2005 grew by an average of 92.3% per year while value increased by 76.8% annually during the same period.
From less than 191 tons in 2001 valued at nearly US$700,000, shipments swelled to 2,385 tons worth about US$6M in 2005.
Leading Buyers of Philippine Cookies by Volume, 2005 Source:
Except for a 12% increase in imports from 5,200 tons in 2001 to 5,800 tons in 2002, biscuit imports have since registered double-digit reductions until 2005.
This is due to the significant purchase contractions from countries like the United States, the United Kingdom (UK), Japan, Indonesia, Thailand, China, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Italy, and Denmark.
Nabisco's Chips Ahoy!, Oreo and Ritz are imported from Indonesia.
From 2001 to 2005 cookie imports registered a high of 1,100 tons in 2003 and a low of 504 tons in 2005.
The United States was the biggest supplier of cookies in 2005 accounting for 41% of the entire import volume.
Indonesia is second with 14% followed by Denmark (10%), Vietnam and China (8% each).
Leading Suppliers of Imported Cookies by Volume, 2005 Source:
Key concerns An industry source explained that the main concern among players focus on the rising costs of raw materials such as flour and sugar, packaging materials, and fuel and electricity costs.
Another concern is the growing consumer spending for transportation and communications attributed mainly to spending on phone cards or cell phone cards which are eating into the consumers' limited disposable income.
Product research and development are also important aspects of the business given increased competition with the entry of more players and the influx of imported brands including lower priced biscuits from China.
The big players have their own research and development teams to come-up with new and interesting biscuits and cookies in better and attractive packaging to attract a wider range of consumers.
Prospects Players see good prospects for the industry in the next three to five years.
The heightened competition in the market with the entry of new local and foreign brands in the past few years is good for both players and the consumers as it sparks innovations in terms of products, promotions, and even pricing.
The country's current economic difficulties are seen by the industry as an opportunity for growth as more consumers turn to biscuits and cookies as alternative "merienda" meals.
Remember the Sky Flakes with various toppings commercial?
The influx of cheaper products does not really worry the local players much because they noticed that consumers become unreceptive to the unreasonably low-priced imports which cause them to doubt the products' quality and taste.
Also, local firms say that the shelf-life is compromised and drastically reduced given the long shipping travel it goes through.
Overall, the industry expects the biscuits and cookies business to be crunchier than the past few years.

Market Information Southeast Asia Savoring the Beer Industry*
Julie T. Plopinio Researcher Center for Food and Agri Business  University of Asia and the Pacific 2006
Beer is considered as the world's oldest and most patronized alcoholic beverage.
According to the Euromonitor, beer is most the consumed alcoholic drink in the Philippines, which accounts for a 70% share of the alcoholic beverage market in terms of volume during 2005.
The country's per capita consumption is 15 liters per year in the same year.
Beer is made from barley, yeast, hops water, and grains.
A process called "fermentation" converts the carbohydrates in the grains and barley to produce alcohol.
Most beers have an alcohol content that ranges from 3%-5% by weight.
History Beer is believed to be over 10,000 years old.
Today, brewing is a global industry comprising of multinational business companies and large numbers of smaller breweries in different countries.
Styles of Beer The American Homebrewer's Association identifies 70 styles of beer, which falls under three main categories: ales (pale, dark or strong), stouts (sweet or bitter) and lagers.
Ales - a beer brewed from barley malt with yeast that quickly ferments, giving sweet, full body and fruits, buttery taste.
Ales are common in Britain, Germany, Canada's eastern provinces, the United States and Belgium.
It is typically fermented at temperatures between 15 degrees Celsius and 24 degrees Celsius.
Stouts - a dark beer made using roasted malts or roast barley.
The first known use of the word "stout" about beer was in 1677, the sense being that a stout beer was a strong beer.
At the end of the 19th century, stout beer got the reputation of being a healthy strengthening drink so it was used by athletes and nursing women, while doctors recommend it to help recovery.
Lagers - a style of beer brewed using slow-acting lager yeast.
Lagers range from sweet to bitter and pale to black.
Most lagers are of pale to medium color, with high carbonation, and alcohol content of 3%-5% by volume.
Primary fermentation starts at 7-12 degrees Celsius.

World Consumption In 2004, global consumption of beer was estimated at 150,392 kL (kilo liters), up by 4.2% from 144,296 kL in 2003.
Growth is attributed to the global economic recovery.
According to the Kirin Research Institute, China has topped the list for two consecutive years as it posted the highest beer consumption in 2004 at 28, 640 kL, an improvement of 16% from 24,995 kL in 2003.

Beer spending was highest for NCR at P2.1 billion (28%), followed by North Luzon and Visayas at P1.4 billion (20%) and P1.5 billion (20%), respectively.
Mindanao posted P1.3 billion (18%), then South Luzon with P1 billion (14%).
Beer expenditure per geographical region, 2003 Source:
Market Players Two local brewers, San Miguel Corporation (SMC) and Asia Brewery Inc (ABI), dominate the Philippine beer market.
SMC controls 90% of the market while ABI and the other imported brands hold the balance of 10%.
Clearly, the good performance of the beer division reflects SMC's strong market position and numerous distribution channels.
The strength of beer sales did not rest on the Philippine market alone.
SMC is present in Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong, China, Indonesia and Australia.
For its international beer operations, volume increased by 11% in 2005 generating US$284 million in revenues, up by 8% in 2004.
Moreover, consolidated operating income also went up by 33% to US$12.9 million.
The company also produces foreign beer brands such as James Boag Premium Lager, Anker Bir, Miller Genuine Draft and Lowenbrau.
The retail prices of some of SMC's products in a leading supermarket in Mandaluyong City ranged from P16.50 to P28.50. Table 2.

The company focuses on beer manufacturing, bottled water production and industrial packaging.
It also produces malt beverage such as beer and shandy, iced tea, bottled water and carbonated soft drinks.
ABI's flagship brand is "Beer na Beer."
Its price is lower compared to competition.
The company also carries other brands such as Carlsberg, Colt 45, Lone Star, Lone Star Light, Lone Star Ultra, Colt Ice and Stag.
Trade The National Statistics Office (NSO) classifies beer under Philippine Standard Commodity Classification Code 1123000 - beer made from malt (including ale, stout and porter, alcohol strength > 0.5%).
From 2001 to 2004, trade has generally been in favor of exports.
This is reflective of strong and continuous efforts of local breweries to widen their international reach.
Meanwhile, imported brands enjoy a small niche market mostly from the upper income classes.
Imports declined by 14% yearly on volume while value increased by 32% annually from 2001-2005.
The decline of volume was largely attributed to the imposition of a new excise tax on the beverage in 2004.
Imports and Exports of Beer, 2001-2005 (Volume in tons; Value in US$'000 CIF for imports; FOB for exports)
NSO In 2005, the leading supplier was Netherlands, which accounted for 22% of the pie.
Singapore was the second largest supplier with 21%, followed by Korea with 20%, China 12% and Germany 7%.
Other countries shared in the remaining 18% of total volume of imports.
Imports of Beer by Country of Origin, by volume, 2005 Source:
Annual exports increased by 0.5% on volume while value was down by 7.2% from 2001-2005.
The five leading country-markets for Philippine beer in 2005 were Taiwan with 32% of the total export volume followed by the USA with 15%, Malaysia with 9%, Singapore with 8% and Japan with 5% of the market.
Other countries shared in the remaining 31% of the total.
Exports of Beer by Country of Destination, by volume, 2005 Source:
Challenges and Prospects Beer mainly consists of barley, yeast, hops water, and grains.
Barley and hops are imported raw materials and therefore, are vulnerable to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
Alcoholic drinks also felt the impact of the implementation of new excise taxes in 2004.
Imports for 2005 were badly affected as players adjusted to the new tax rates.
Despite the price hike, beer managed to increase sales volume with intensified promotions and brand-recall campaigns.
Analysts say the industry faces a tough year as high-energy bills would force consumers to cut back on alcohol consumption.
Nonetheless, the industry's performance will still be driven by the growing brewpubs in the country as well as the numerous fiestas and celebrations.
There is also a good potential in emerging markets such as the entry of young drinkers as well as the increasing number of working women in the country.
Further, older drinkers are moving to beer as a healthier alternative to consuming less alcohol.
Overall, the beer industry will continue to thrive as companies strive to broaden their markets locally and internationally by building attractive brand campaigns and developing new products.

Sugar confectionery products refer to chocolates, soft and hard candies (orange sweets, jelly, marshmallows, and butterballs and lemon drops, respectively), and gums.
The World Market Research firm Euromonitor International estimated that the global confectionery market in 2005 reached US$122 billion.
Western Europe accounted for the biggest share with 39% equivalent to US$46.7 billion followed by North America (25%, US$29.2 billion), Asia-Pacific (15%, US$18.7 billion), Eastern Europe (8%, US$10.3 billion), Latin America (8%, US$10.2 billion), Africa/Middle East (3%, US$4.2 billion), and Australia (2%, US$2.9 billion).
Global Confectionery Market Size, 2005 Source:
Euromonitor International - The World Market for Confectionery, 2005 Beginning 2005 through 2009, the research firm projected the global confectionery market to grow by 2.3% annually.
This paper projects that growth will be fast in Asia Pacific.
The Philippine Market For the Philippines, the latest Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES, 2003) of the National Statistics Office found that the total household spending on sugar products (candies, chocolates, chewing gum, merengue, etc.) reached P3.3 billion, higher by nearly 10% from the P3.0 billion total spending reported in the 2000 and 1997 FIES survey.
This is equivalent to an average yearly growth rate of 3.2%.
The improvement is attributed to increased spending (compared to 2000) in several regions in the country.
The region with the biggest gain was Central Visayas with a growth rate of 108%, Soccsksargen (76.5%), Central Luzon (46.3%), Northern Mindanao (33.9%), Southern Tagalog (17.1%), Eastern Visayas (14.3%), Cagayan Valley (6.8%), Central Visayas (5.4%), Ilocos Region (3.7%), and ARMM (1.7%).

Exports increased by 23.5% per year from 315 tons (US$898,000) in 2000 to 637 tons (US$1.6 million) in 2005.
The top buyers in 2005 were Thailand representing 30% of the entire export volume followed by Australia (24%), Taiwan (12%), Singapore (9%), and USA (8%).
In contrast, imports declined by an average of 7.5% per year from 3,673 tons (US$15 million) in 2000 to 2,219 tons (US$5.8 million) in 2005.
The country in 2005 purchased 37% of its total import volume from the US, followed by Singapore (19%), Malaysia (13%), Switzerland (9%), and Brazil (6%).
Philippine Trade of Chocolate Confectionery, 2000-2005 - Volume in tons; Value in '000 US$ FOB for Exports and CIF for Imports
Key Concerns Sugar price remains the main concern for local confectionery producers.
In addition, fuel and electricity costs as well as packaging materials are important concerns.
In terms of packaging, the influx of imported confectionery products somehow forced the local players to improve on this aspect.
Another critical factor for local players is their ability to adapt to the emerging trends in the industry.
The list includes: (a) limited editions; (b) dark chocolates; (c) high-end and gourmet candy; (d) high cocoa content chocolates; (e) single origin chocolates; (f) sugar-free gums; (g) licorice gums; (h) single serve seasonal offerings; and (i) breath fresheners.
Prospects The industry sees an optimistic outlook in the next three to five years.
Despite the surge of imported confectionery products (e.g. imported confectionery products sold for P15 to P20 per 100 grams by retailers in major malls), local players still have an advantage as they are able to produce products that capture the Filipino's discriminating taste at far-lower prices.
As described by the US NCA, while most consumable products have a dominant retail outlet, confectionery products can be sold anywhere.
An example is Cadbury chocolates a few years ago which entered the non-traditional outlets, particularly, major department stores SM and Robinsons.
The company placed point-of-sales booths beside non-food items such as cosmetics, apparel, etc. giving it the needed additional exposure other than what it gets from the usual snack exchange section.
According to marketing experts, the strategy was so successful that sales expanded by several fold.
As the sugar confectionery industry slowly moves toward the peak occasions of Christmas and Valentine's Day, players will surely experience a sweet and delightful business ahead.

Market Information Southeast Asia The Brewing Business of the Philippine Specialty Coffee Shop Industry*
In the past, people were used to drinking instant coffee.
This was before the advent of specialty coffee shops in the country.
Today, coffee shops are a common sight especially in the Manila metropolis.
The SCAA further explained that specialty coffee tastes better than instant or mass-produced coffee because it is made from coffee beans grown only in ideal climates and prepared according to exacting standards.
Also, specialty coffee possesses a richer and more balanced flavor.
HISTORY Specialty coffee shops trace their roots from the coffee shops of Europe in the 16th and 17th century upon the introduction of coffee which became a popular drink.
In the United States, specialty coffee shops are said to have been popularized by Starbucks Coffee.
Starbucks Coffee was established in 1971 by Gordon Bowker, Jerry Baldwin, and Zev Siegl originally to sell coffee beans only.
The company's current business of retailing coffee beverages came about when then marketing person Howard Schultz (currently Chairman) got interested in selling espresso by the cup after visiting Italy.
Initially, the company tested the new business model in one of its outlets and became an instant hit.
Despite of this success, however, one of the owners opposed Schultz's idea of expanding the concept to all of its stores.
In 1985, Schultz left Starbucks and opened his own specialty coffee shop called Il Giornale.
By 1987, the owners of Starbucks decided to sell the company to focus on a 1983 acquisition Peet's Coffee and & Tea, which was Starbuck's coffee bean supplier.
Schultz, together with other investors, purchased Starbucks for US$3.7 million.
Schultz eventually changed II Giornale's name to Starbucks Coffee Company.
Starbucks currently has more than 10,000 outlets worldwide, with 93 located in the Philippines operated by its franchisee Rustan Coffee Corporation.
In the Philippines, even before Starbucks came in 1997, there were enterprising Filipinos who had the foresight to put-up specialty coffee shops.
The pioneers in the local industry are Figaro Coffee Company and The Coffee Experience, both established in early 1993.
Figaro Coffee Company was set up by a group headed by Pacita Juan, the company's president and chief executive officer.
Its first outlet was a small kiosk located at the Glorietta mall in Makati.
The outlet was initially called the F store.
The Coffee Experience, meanwhile, started in the same mall in Makati, also under a different name - Coffee X. It now has 24 outlets located mainly in Metro Manila.
Companies also offer other beverages such as tea and juices, complementing products such as breads, cakes, and pastries which are produced in the operators' own commissary plant, supplied by an affiliate or purchased from third party suppliers.
Some even serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
MARKET AND PLAYERS The market for specialty coffee shops was estimated to be at least P2.6 billion in 2004 (Figure 1).
Foreign brands accounted for 69 percent of the market; the rest are local brands.
Estimated Market Shares by Brand Type, 2004 Source:
SEC, Interviews with Key Players, February-March 2006 As of February 2006, the Philippine specialty coffee shop industry consisted of at least 15 major players - 10 are foreign and five are local brands.
The foreign brands include Café Nescafe, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Dome Café, Gloria Jean's Coffees, McCafe, San Francisco Coffee Co., Seattle's Best Coffee, Segafredo Zanetti Espresso, Starbuck's Coffee and UCC Coffee (Table 1).
Local companies have managed to get the master franchise for the operation of these foreign specialty coffee shops in the country.
Some of the outlets are owned and operated by other companies through sub-franchising offered by the master franchise holders.
The local brands, meanwhile, are Bo's Coffee Club, Figaro Coffee Company, Mocha Blends, and The Coffee Beanery.
Other local specialty coffee shops that have recently sprouted in Metro Manila include Baang Coffee, Libreria, and Coffee Republic, with less than five outlets each.
The outlets are located mainly in Metro Manila and in key cities such as Baguio, Cebu, and Davao.
The large number of outlets is attributed mainly to the growing specialty coffee shop chains.

The others cornered the remaining 16 percent of the market.
Local and foreign key players estimated growth at an average of 10 percent to 20 percent per year since 2002.
The financial statements of industry leader Starbucks Coffee even showed a higher growth of nearly 23 percent per year over the same period.

Specialty Coffee Shop survey (April 2006)
SOURCES OF SUPPLY The main raw materials used are coffee beans; espresso machines; fresh milk; whipped cream; and packaging materials (Table 3).
Interviews with Key Players, February-March 2006 According to players foreign and local alike, it is easy to get suppliers for their major inputs.
The prevalence of suppliers - which normally cater to restaurants, hotels and other institutional clients - has led to a situation wherein the suppliers themselves approach the companies to offer their products.
The critical factor among players is the coffee bean roasting "formula" because it is at this stage where the coffee bean releases its fullest flavor potential.
Poorly roasted beans would yield poor-tasting coffee drink.
As such, every player treats his proprietary roasting techniques and recipe as highly confidential.
Nearly all of the foreign brands interviewed say their coffee beans - prepared and packed - are supplied by their parent company overseas, which does the purchasing and roasting of beans bought from many popular coffee-growing areas like Indonesia, East Africa, and Latin America.
Because of this practice, the local players are seen as major supporters of the local coffee industry.
Further, their use of Kapeng Barako sets them apart from their foreign counterparts because the beans are said to have the following characteristics: (a) particularly strong taste, (b) powerful body, and (c) a distinctly pungent odor which the popular Arabica beans do not have.
For espresso machines, majority of the foreign and local players use Italian brands which they acquire through local distributors.
For fresh milk, the players buy from various sources.
Many purchase from well-known milk suppliers such as Alaska Milk Corporation, Consolidated Dairy and Frozen Food Corporation, Nestle Philippines, New Zealand Milk (Philippines) Inc., and San Miguel Corporation.
For whipped cream, nearly all players use imported brands distributed by local companies in the country.
Lastly, packaging materials are either sourced from affiliates overseas or from local packaging companies.
Interestingly, Starbucks Coffee being the industry leader requires exclusivity from its suppliers.
In other words, their suppliers are not allowed to cater to other specialty coffee shops.
They can, however, still service hotels, restaurants and other foodservice outlets.
While the other players do not require their suppliers to be exclusive, they do not allow them to sell to other specialty coffee shops exactly the same products (e.g. breads, cakes, and pastries) as some of the recipes are proprietary.
INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS Some of the major players meet and discuss as members of the private sector-led National Coffee Development Board (NCDB), which aims to promote and save the local coffee industry from declining production and area planted.
The group incidentally started as the government's National Task Force on Coffee Rehabilitation which was sworn into office by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo in May 2002.
One of NCDB's programs is the Kape Isla Cooperative Marketing whose objective is to develop loyalty to Philippine coffee, reduce imports, increase domestic production, and create new jobs.
The Program's Kape Isla seal is intended for the use of the different players in the industry as a Philippine coffee quality seal.
The Program's members are specialty coffee retail shops such as Bo's Coffee Club, Coffee Experience, The Coffee Beanery, Figaro Coffee Company, Mocha Blends, Starbucks, and Seattle's Best Coffee, as well as coffee bean growers, millers, roasters, local governments, and agriculture credit sectors.
Another organization is the Specialty Coffee Association of the Philippines (SCAP), which was established in 1998 to promote and support the specialty coffee trade in the country.
SCAP's objectives are: to advocate Philippine specialty coffee as world class; encourage members to use Philippine specialty coffee in their coffee outlets; sponsor events and forums that showcase Philippine specialty coffee; provide programs to assist local coffee farmers; upgrade the quality of coffee; and to promote general awareness and appreciation of Philippine specialty coffee (F&B World, November/December 2003).
PROSPECTS The specialty coffee shop industry is seen to sustain its growth of 10 percent to 20 percent yearly for the next three to five years.
Players attribute this to the growing awareness of specialty coffee among consumers, the improving image of coffee in general as something that is good for the health, and the expanding family spending on eating-out.
Players also capitalize on what is popular such as the availability of wireless internet or WIFI and the offering of potential product substitutes such as tea, juices, shakes, chocolate drinks, and healthy products such as salads, low-calorie versions of their best-selling drinks, pastries and the like.
The offering of customer loyalty programs also helps them push their sales targets.
Overall, the continuing focus on addressing key success factors such as product development and innovation, brand and product promotion, and outlet expansion would allow the industry to continue to enjoy a brewing business and at the same time, help the development of the domestic coffee growing industry.

Market Information Southeast Asia The Philippine Fertilizer Industry*
Florence Mojica-Sevilla Senior Agribusiness Specialist  Center for Food and Agri Business  University of Asia and the Pacific 2006
Agriculture faces the challenge of increasing production to provide food for the growing population.
Increasing population puts pressure on the cultivation of marginal land areas and results to land degradation and decline in soil production potential.
To maintain soil fertility and productivity and to prevent land degradation and erosion, nutrients taken by crops must be replenished through the application of fertilizers.
Fertilizers are a major cost item in Philippine agriculture.
They increase yield and enable the country to attain sufficiency in food and agro-industrial crops.
Fertilizers have also made crop production possible in unproductive soils.
These include: urea (32%), complete or 14-14-14 (21%), ammonium sulfate or 21-0-0 (20%), and mono-ammonium phosphate or 16-20-0 (18%).
SUPPLY-DEMAND OF FERTILIZER, CY 1995-2005 (Volume in Thousand Tons)
SUPPLY
Fertilizer and Pesticides Authority (FPA) Based on preliminary reports submitted by fertilizer companies, sales in 2005 reached 978,000 tons.
Luzon accounted for 50-60% of the inorganic fertilizer market, Visayas 17-20%, and Mindanao 20-28%.
An estimated 60% of fertilizer sales are used for food crops, principally rice and corn, with the remainder mainly applied to plantation crops such as banana, sugarcane, and pineapple.
Bulk (60%) of the inorganic fertilizer supply is imported.
The majority of the finished fertilizer grades are sourced from Saudi Arabia, Japan, Ukraine, China and Indonesia.
Other important suppliers include Qatar, Malaysia, Singapore, Russia, Korea and Taiwan (Figure 1).
Urea Imports by Country of Origin, 2005 (Total: 570,286 tons) Source of basic data:
National Statistics Office (NSO) As of 2005, there are 119 registered importers licensed by the FPA.
AFC Fertilizer and Chemicals, Inc., Farmix Fertilizer, Soiltech Agricultural Products Corporation, La Filipina Uy Gongco, Modern Time Enterprises, and Norsk Hydro (Phil.). Production.
Domestic fertilizer production in 2004 totaled 1.1 M tons, largely in the form of 14-14-14 (33%), 16-20-0 (23%), 21-0-0 (15%) and 16-16-8 (12%) (Figure 2).
Inorganic Fertilizer Production by Grade, Philippines, 2004 (Total: 1,072,835 tons) Source of basic data:
FPA The Philippines currently has three fertilizer manufacturing plants that produce various fertilizer grades for local use and for export; one is located in Luzon and the other two in the Visayas.
The fertilizers manufactured locally include 21-0-0, 16-20-0, 18-46-0, 0-18-0 (single superphosphate), 15-15-15, 14-14-14, 12-12-12, 16-16-8, 6-9-15, and 0-0-52 (sulfate of potash).
Three other chemical fertilizer plants ceased operation between the late 1970s and early 1980s due to uncompetitive production costs:
Maria Cristina, Chemical Industries of the Philippines, and Planters Products.
Some amount of ammonium sulfate is also exported to Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan, and Palau (Figure 3).
For the manufacturer of these various nutrient grades, local fertilizer plants depend partly upon the use of imported raw materials such as rock phosphate, anhydrous ammonia, and sulphuric acid.
Ammonium Sulfate Export by Country of Destination, 2005 (Total: 72,154 tons) Source of basic data:
NSO The most widely used fertilizer grades are urea, 21-0-0 and 16-20-0.
Urea is mainly used as a nitrogen source while 16-20-0 is applied as a source of both nitrogen and phosphorus.
In some areas 18-46-0, and to some extent, 14-14-14, are used instead of 16-20-0.
Organic Fertilizer The government and some private enthusiasts and environmentalists are now into the re-introduction of organic faming.
Organic farming is a farming system that promotes, among other practices, the use of organic fertilizers.
Organic matter is an essential component of healthy soils, and all sound farming practices integrate and allocate available organic materials to maintain or improve soil fertility.
The Philippines, with its agricultural based economy, has a plentiful supply of organic wastes.
A wide variety of organic materials can be used as fertilizers, such as animal manures (e.g. livestock dung, liquid manure from livestock holding facilities), agricultural by-products and processing wastes (e.g. mudpress), green manures (e.g. grass, leaves), domestic wastes (e.g. sewage), and industrial wastes (e.g. wastes from distilleries, sugar refineries, fish canning plants).
Chicken manure is the standard organic fertilizer used locally, although cattle and carabao manures, mudpress, and rice bran are also used at a lesser extent.
Unlike inorganic fertilizers, animal manures not only provide nutrients but also organic substrate vital for enhancing primary productivity within aquatic environments.
Chicken manure is the most valuable because of its effectiveness in promoting natural food growth, its availability, and its ease in handling and application.
Processed organic fertilizers Processed organic fertilizers are composed of a mixture of animal manures, agricultural wastes (e.g. mudpress), and limestone, composted for at least a week through biological, chemical, and mechanical action.
These are usually enriched with primary and secondary nutrients, and in some cases, also with trace elements.
The product appears like soil or peat and normally contains two to six times more nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium than fresh manures.
Because animal manures are a major ingredient in processed organic fertilizers, it should not come as a surprise that many of the manufacturers are located near poultry and livestock farming centers.
Domestic organic fertilizer production in 2005 totaled 25,465 tons (Table 2).
Sales during the period amounted to 20,650 tons.
Following the trade liberalization policy and the removal of levy and other restrictions, smaller companies engaged in agricultural trading were able to enter into the fertilizer market, once controlled only by a few private and government-assisted firms.
The marketing of fertilizers passes through three main levels, namely: (1) importers/ manufacturers; (2) distributors; and (3) dealers.
All importations can only be made by FPA licensed importers and cover only products registered at the FPA.
As of 2005, there are about 369 fertilizer handlers (manufacturers, importers, repackers, exporters, distributors) licensed by FPA.
The fertilizer distributors or wholesalers constitute the second level of fertilizer marketing, and usually cover several provinces or an entire region.
They sell to dealers or outlets.
A few importers are also distributors themselves and this provides them with the advantage of direct market access.
The dealers constitute the last step of the marketing channel and are the ones in direct contact with the farmers.
Because of the free market system, most distributors also hold a dealer's license, and sell directly in areas where there are no dealers or in conditions where local dealers are weak, or selling to plantation accounts which do not require the networking advantage offered by the dealers.
In many cases, it is therefore difficult to draw the line between distributors and dealers.
Imported fertilizers, as finished products in bulk or in bags, are discharged in major ports such as Manila and Poro Point in Luzon; Iloilo, Bacolod, and Cebu in the Visayas; and Cagayan de Oro, Davao, and General Santos in Mindanao.
Pricing The selling price of inorganic fertilizers is generally affected by the prevailing international market price, foreign exchange rate, and the local supply and demand situation as influenced by factors such as changes in rainfall pattern, type of crop planted, calamities, and importer speculation.
Retail prices of six major fertilizer grades are presented in Table 3.
Prices of fertilizers have been increasing for the past eleven years due to rising world prices and foreign exchange.
Prices of urea had tripled from a low of P314/bag in 1999 to P950/bag in 2005 (Figure 4).
Retail prices of all other grades had been increasing.
The highest jump was recorded for 18-46-0 with the highest price of P1,400/bag in 2005 compared to P396/bag in 1995.
Average Retail Prices of Urea and 18-46-0, CY 1995-2005 Source:
Conclusion Fertilizers are said to impact positively on crop production.
They help in minimizing soil degradation, particularly soil erosion while maintaining and enhancing soil fertility as a whole.
Studies show that combining inorganic and organic sources of plant nutrients is a beneficial option for the crop and soil system and hence can be of great benefit to both farmers and the environment.
The increasing cost of fertilizer, however, continues to be a major problem by farmers.
Today, producers complain that fertilizer costs in the Philippines are far higher than those in Malaysia and Thailand.
High fertilizer prices translate to higher production cost.
Further because of high prices, fertilizer use is usually below the recommended levels.
The production and supply of fertilizers are of vital importance to food security.
A prerequisite for producing the quantity and quality of affordable food is that the farming community has adequate access to fertilizers, i.e. proximity to markets on equitable terms.
This requires that farmers are able to choose between various sources of supply of fertilizer grades, at prices they can afford and in the quantity, quality and at the time they are required.
It is also necessary to provide an environment in which those involved in fertilizer production and supply can enter freely.

FOOD AND BEVERAGE WHOLESALE/RETAIL SURVEY BRUNEI March 2000
CANADIAN HIGH COMMISSION
1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background and Aim of the Survey The Wholesale/Retail survey is the first of its kind being carried out by the High Commission of Canada in Brunei with consultation from the Universitiy Brunei Darussalam.
According to the statistics provided by the Canadian High Commission, Brunei imports almost 90% of their food requirements.
This indicates that wholesalers and retailers in Brunei currently import a large quantity of food and beverages.
The data for this survey were collected using an 11-item questionnaire, which was designed by the Commercial Officer of the Canadian High Commission.
A list consisting of 25 wholesalers and retailers were drawn up and the survey questionnaires were distributed to them via fax.
Twenty-three out of the 25 companies responded to the survey.
The survey report will provide general information to Canadian food & beverage exporters who are interested in the Brunei market.
Attached is a list of potential importers in Brunei whom Canadian exporters may wish to contact.
To summarize, here are the two main objectives of the present survey:
• To determine the types of products that wholesalers and retailers in Brunei are currently importing, and the type of Canadian products, if any.
• To determine whether there is a potential for expanding Canadian food and beverage products into the Bruneian food and beverage import market.
Twenty-five companies were faxed a copy of the questionnaire and 23 W/R replied, giving us a return rate of 92%.
Out of the 23 companies, 12 were Wholesalers, six were Retailers and the remaining five were Wholesalers and Retailers.
The table and graph below show the variation annual turnover of the companies:
Table 1:
2.2 Descriptive Data 2.2.1 Food and Beverages Currently Imported To determine the type of food products the W/R surveyed are currently importing from various countries, eleven (11) food type categories were drawn up in the survey to indicate the type of products.
These 11 categories are:
Table 2:
Food Categories and Number of W/R Currently Importing the Food Category.
Dairy Products (milk, cheese, yoghurt) 16 3.
Deli Meats 4 6.
Pasta Products 7 7.
Edible Oil (Canola) 9 8.
Salad Dressings 6 9.
Frozen Meals/Desserts/Vegetable 10 10.
Confectionary (chocolates, candies) 15 11.
As with food, beverages that were currently imported were also surveyed.
4 categories of drinks were included in the survey:
Beverage Categories and Number of W/R Currently Importing the Drink Category 1.
Fruit Juices 12 2.
Mineral Water 6 3.
Flavoured Drinks 13 4.
Soft Drinks 11 2.2.2 Types of Canadian Products Currently Imported 6 out of the 23 W/R surveyed indicated that they are currently importing some Canadian food products.
These Canadian food products are:
• Whipping Cream
• Edible Oil
• Snacks
• Maple Syrup, Oil, Juices 2.2.3 Product Line Expansion The W/R surveyed were asked whether they have any interest in expanding into any Canadian food products.
Some W/R have indicated an interest in the various food categories, highest being the Snacks, Canned Meat/Food/Vegetable, Confectionary, Cereal/Health Foods, Dairy Products, and Syrups/Jams/Spreads categories, with between eight to 12 W/R indicating an interest in importing these products from Canada.
The table below shows the number of W/R that are interested in importing the food types from Canada:
Food Categories and Number of W/R Interested in Expansion of Product Line.
Canned Meat/Food/Vegetable 10 2.
Dairy Products (milk, cheese, yoghurt) 8 3.
Syrups/Jams/Spreads 8 4.
Snacks (chips/crackers/cookies/nuts) 12 5.
Cereals/Health Foods 9 2.2.4 Importing/Distributing Canadian Food and Beverage Products The W/R surveyed were also asked whether they have any long-term objectives, in terms of importing and distribution of Canadian food and beverage products.
10 (44%) wholesalers/retailers indicated that they would like to import directly from Canada, one (4%) is interested in going through Hong Kong, five (22%) through Singapore, two (9%) through Malaysia while three (13%) W/R had no plans.
One W/R indicated they were interested in importing through another destination (though unspecified by the W/R).
A summary of the figures is presented below:
Although a high interest is shown from W/R to import directly from Canada, it may not be viable and the reasons for this will be discussed below.
CONCLUSIONS 3.1 Findings From the Survey The present survey was carried out to determine whether there is a potential market in Brunei for Canadian food and beverage products.
From the present survey, we have found that a high number of W/R in Brunei are currently importing a variety of food products.
At present, Canadian food and beverage products have only a small footing in the Brunei imported food and beverage market.
The types of Canadian products currently imported include French Fries, Edible Oil, Snacks, Maple Syrups, Whipping Cream and Juices.
There is a huge potential to expand Canadian products into all the food and beverage product categories that are currently dominated by produce from other countries.
It may also be very encouraging for Canadian exporters to know that most W/R that we surveyed indicated their interest in expanding into various Canadian products (as listed in Table 4), covering almost all of the food categories (except Deli Meats - reasons for lack of interest in this food category will be discussed later).
At present, as reported by the Canadian High Commission, the top food exporter for Brunei is Singapore, followed by Thailand and Malaysia.
Next on the list of importers is Australia, the USA and followed by Europe (please note that Singapore appears top of the list of importers not due to production but because Singapore is a transshipment center for products from other countries).
Perhaps with the strategic planning and marketing, Canadian products can be introduced to compete with these food and beverage products that are currently imported.
Only companies operating within the Brunei-Muara district where the capital of Brunei is situated were surveyed).
Hence figures for annual turnover of W/R may be underestimated and actual figures could be higher.
We shall now look at some of the potential problems Canadian food and beverage exporters may face when introducing their products into the Bruneian market: 3.2.2 The 'Halal' Issue Brunei is a Muslim country which adhere strictly to religious regulations towards the types of food that can be sold and consumed by the Muslim population, which comprise more than 80% of the total population of Brunei.
These regulations apply specifically to all meat products (chicken, beef, and lamb), including canned meat, as well as any food products which may contain animal by-products such as gelatin.
Meat products that are sold in the Brunei market must be "halal".
Halal food refers to meat products produced from animals that have been slaughtered and prepared according to Muslim rites.
Hence any canned meat or deli meats that are imported into Brunei must have been slaughtered according to Muslim rites with a "halal" certification.
Please take note that this does not include the following:
• Pork, which cannot be consumed by Muslims at all,
• Seafood such as fish, prawns, etc. which are not subject to the Halal regulation and can be consumed without restrictions.
Recently the Brunei Government has been very strict with non-halal food being brought into the country.
It is therefore advisable for exporters to be cautious if venturing into this food category.
Perhaps, due to this reason, none of the 23 W/R surveyed indicated any interest in expanding into the Deli Meat products.
However, seafood products are not subject to halal regulations and therefore seafood products (e.g. canned fish, tuna, prawns, etc.) may be a potential food category that can be targeted.
Although pork cannot be consumed by Muslims, there is a small market within Brunei that caters to non-Muslims.
Therefore pork products may be a potential market area where Canadian products may be able to venture into.
3.2.3 Competition from Local and Regional Products Canadian products may face competition from the variety of local and regional products that are available in terms of costs, diversity and palatability.
Cost may be a very important factor and these local and regional products may be more economical than Canadian products, which may be subjected to extra costs from shipping and tax.
However, for the Canola Oil, the increasing health awareness among Bruneians may be an asset when marketing this food category.
Perhaps Canadian exporters could target this and perhaps, through a Canadian Food Fair, educate Bruneians on the health benefits of low fat edible oil from Canada while at the same time marketing their edible oil products.
It is also important to mention that Brunei is a member of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) which encourage intra-ASEAN trade, which may affect the importation of products.
Hence products outside the ASEAN region may be subjected to import quota which may restrict the amount of products that can be imported from other countries.
The favourable currency exchange may also encourage Brunei to import from neighboring countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, etc, which have lower currency rates than Brunei.
Currently, Brunei dollars are at a par with Singapore Dollars, which has the highest rates among all the ASEAN countries ($1.00 Brunei Dollar is approximately $1.00-$1.10 Canadian Dollar).
3.2.4 Beverages It is important to note that since Brunei is a Muslim country, there is strictly no importation of any form of alcoholic beverages.
At present, alcohol may only be brought in for personal consumption from neighboring countries, under strict quota regulations.
Canadian beverages such as mineral water, soft drinks, and fruit juices, may face competition from local and regional products.
Most soft drinks are produced in the region and most are canned in Brunei (e.g. Pepsi, F&N soft drinks).
3.2.5 Importing directly from Canada Some of the W/R surveyed indicated an interest in importing their products directly from Canada.
Perhaps this would cut shipping costs for Bruneian W/R by shipping direct, rather than going through regional transshipment ports.
However, the amount of Canadian food and beverage products currently imported is very minimal and to ship directly from Canada would be highly impractical.
This will only become a viable option when Canadian products are imported in larger quantities.
3.3 Suggestions From what we have found in the present survey, we conclude that although the Bruneian food import market is relatively small, a potential market exists for Canadian food and beverage products in specific food categories (as listed in Table 4).
More aggressive strategies such as raising awareness of the benefits of Canadian products (perhaps in terms of prices, palatability, and health issues) should be adopted if a venture into the Brunei market is planned.
At present, Australian products enjoy an annual marketing program via an Australian Food Fair.
Perhaps Canadian exporters should consider such a marketing strategy which will no doubt benefit greatly by raising awareness of the specific advantages that Canadian products may have over rival imported products.

The Biotechnology Sector in Thailand July 2002
I. Introduction This report provides an overview of the biotechnology sector in Thailand, relevant government policies and organizations, priorities, and where the industry may be heading in the years ahead.
Biotechnology is a priority sector for Thailand and as such is receiving substantial R&D funding from the government.
R&D activities are the backbone of the biotechnology customer base in Thailand, which is mainly restricted to government-sponsored research organizations.
In addition to this general document on the biotechnology sector in Thailand, there are also two companion market studies that identify potential opportunities for Canadian biotechnology companies on a sub-sectoral basis and which can be found on the Canadian Embassy, Bangkok website:
• The Market for Agriculture and Food Biotechnology Products in Thailand
• The Market for Imported Diagnostic Kits in Thailand
Sector overview The Government of Thailand considers biotechnology as an important sector of opportunity.
The government has recognized the potential value of biotechnology in helping achieve enhancements in productivity, particularly in view of the tremendous importance of the agriculture and food sector to Thailand's economy.
As such, the government has identified two areas that are the focus of its efforts in biotechnology:
• Improved agricultural productivity
• Improvement of public health The biotechnology industry in Thailand is still very much in its infancy; there are several pipeline products but few have been commercialized.
Commercial bio-industry products in Thailand are first generation.
There are initiatives under way to stimulate the creation of a vibrant biotechnology sector in Thailand; these are centered on the 80-acre Science Park, recently completed in Rangsit, 20km from Bangkok.
This will provide incubator units, pilot plants, greenhouses and accommodation as well as finance, management and legal support.
NSTDA and BIOTEC moved there in June 2002.
It is hoped that this will provide the critical mass needed to attract private investors.
Government policies in support of biotechnology The government remains the driving force of research and development in Thailand.
University projects tend to be reactionary, addressing an immediate need or problem, rather than long term and strategic.
In 2001, total R&D expenditures available to the universities in Thailand amounted to approximately C$40.6 million.
Government expenditure on R&D was mainly on development of agriculture, forestry and fishing, with lesser amounts on promotion of industrial development, environment, and health care.
Over the period 2001 - 2006 the government plans to increase RD&E funding to 0.5% of the annual budget.
The private sector, through various incentives and collaborative schemes, will allocate up to 0.25% of sales in RD&E investment.
In the case of biotechnology, the government funds about 80% of the research and development and directs the policy and the research agenda.
Most of the funding for research in Thailand still originates from the government.
Private funds for research are very limited.
As such, the availability and sufficiency of research funds are a key challenge in this area.
The projects include studies of dengue fever, malaria, the blood disease thalassaemia, and rental tubular acidosis, a disease causing a kidney disorder.
This is achieved through conducting R&D projects, the facilitation of transfer of advanced technologies from overseas, human resources development at all levels, institution building, information services, and the development of public understanding of the benefits of biotechnology.
BIOTEC is both a granting and implementing agency.
The construction of a Science and Technology Park will be completed in early 2001 and will house BIOTEC's main laboratories including pilot-plant, greenhouse and incubator unit.
BIOTEC is responsible for national laboratories whose major objective is to develop the capability for conducting research, development and engineering in the area of genetic engineering and biotechnology.
The activities of the national laboratories reinforce and compliment the other major NSTDA objectives in supporting the RD&E activities of supported agencies.
The research programs are planned and prioritized in conjunction with stakeholders from the private sector and academia.
The national laboratories perform RD&E activities that are closer to the market, preferably on demand from the industries, and provide technical services to the technology users.
BIOTEC at present has 11 laboratories located at the NSTDA Yothi Building and the following are involved in agriculture:
• Plant tissue culture laboratory
• Mycology laboratory
• Shrimp DNA technology laboratory.
BIOTEC also has specialized laboratories at the following universities:
Plant Genetic Engineering Unit, Kasetsart University, Kampaengsaen Campus The major task of this institute is to coordinate the various activities of scientists from the affiliated organizations.
It also serves as an R&D center for basic and applied research with an emphasis on economically important plants which are resistant to diseases and extreme environmental conditions.
Microbial Genetic Engineering Unit, Mahidol University The Microbial Genetic Engineering Unit is a biotechnology laboratory which focuses on the study of microorganisms.
It also disseminates techniques and technical know-how to concerned parties.
A recent study involved the development of a new strain of bacteria capable of controlling and eliminating disease carrying insects.
This study includes a detailed study of a gene responsible for killing mosquito larvae.
The insertion of this gene in the photosynthetic bacterium, A. quadruplicatum and use of DNA probes for detecting microorganisms are currently being investigated.
Marine Biotechnology Laboratory at Chulalongkorn University The main objective of this particular unit is to conduct R&D in aquaculture technology and marine bioresources for industrial and medical purposes.
Current research topics include the improvement of oyster species, techniques for abalone cultivation; physiological studies of Spirulina spp. and the hybridization of king prawn.
Biochemical Engineering and Pilot Plant Unit at King Mongkut's University of Technology, Thonburi This specialized laboratory aims to be a centre for coordinating the activities of scholars and engineers from network institutions.
It also serves as a center for developing human resource capabilities in biochemical engineering e.g. design, construction and maintenance of a pilot plant and the development of separations technology for use in the development of new products and the improvement of production efficiency.
Medical Biotechnology Center at Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University The objectives of this laboratory are to carry out R&D in the application of biotechnology in health and health related areas.
Emphasis is placed on the development of diagnostic kits for tropical diseases such as dengue and malaria.
Cassava and Starch Conversion Technology Unit at Kasetsart University The objective of this unit is to develop value-added products from cassava and rice starch such as modified starch and high value food products.
Bioservice Unit The main objective of this unit is to provide biomolecular resources for researchers from both public and private sectors.
Services that the unit currently provides include the analysis of biological samples using new techniques such as fluorescence activated cell sorting and capillary electrophoresis.
The unit also provides custom synthesized oligonucleotides.
DNA Fingerprinting Unit The main responsibility of this unit is to provide support for using DNA Fingerprinting technology for the quality assessment of plant varieties, animal breeds, and food products.
Research in related areas such as molecular marker development and genome research are also carried out.
Following EU regulations on GMO labeling, there has been a tremendous increase in demand for testing raw food materials and food products from the private sector in Thailand.
As the only facility in the country capable of testing for GMO content, the DNA technology laboratory is operating at full capacity in response to the demand.
The unit has the capability to identify foreign genes in most organisms and food products including soya sauce (patent pending), with the exception of high purity oil.
V. Other players in biotechnology sector The number of private companies and research institutions active in biotechnology R&D are limited.
Most foreign companies have done little biotechnology R&D in Thailand, having participated in the Thai market through export and technology transfer activities.
Several of the Thai universities are involved in some form of biotechnology research but it is not extensive.
A non-exclusive listing of research work at universities is contained in Table 3.
With a strong agricultural base, it is not surprising that the food processing and production industrial sector are those with the keenest interest in the use of molecular biology and biotechnology for:
• Food processing and increasing value add of products
• Genetic improvement of plants and livestock
• evelopment of diagnostics (There are around approximately 2-3 companies producing locally developed diagnostics and 4-5 companies producing diagnostics developed overseas.)
• Development of biological products, especially for biological control in agriculture.
With these interests in mind and awareness of the costs involved in research, industry linkages with local institutes are often on a consortium basis.
Examples include:
• King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Thonburi has linkages with the Algal Production Industry and a consortium interested in anaerobic treatment of agro-industrial waste.
There is a considerable amount of collaboration by Thailand with foreign countries in biotechnology that is seen by Thailand as an effective way of keeping abreast of developments with the least investment.
Canada is one of these participants (see Table 4 for listing) Scientific Entrepreneurship:
The drive towards scientific entrepreneurship is still in its infancy in Thailand and the translational infrastructure requires significant development.
Other parties, who are receptive to such investments, include the Nomura JAFCO Capital Co Ltd, which makes deals of approximately 10 million baht.
Main sectors of activity Protecting and building its export business in agriculture and food products is of considerable concern to Thailand and anything that will enhance Thailand's position in these markets is of interest.
However, the regulatory framework of some of its principal trading partners, particularly Europe and Japan, restricts the adoption of biotechnology products thereby to some extent limiting Thailand's capability to embrace this technology.
Local Non Government Organizations (NGO's) and other public interest groups have become increasingly vocal in their anti-biotechnology stance.
On the other hand, the Thai government acknowledges the value of biotechnology and appears keen to embrace this technology, seeing it as a means to protect small-medium scale enterprises whose existence will be threatened when Thailand opens its agri-food industry under the World Trade Organization agreement.
The government sees biotechnology as means for many of these industries to improve their products and efficiencies.
The interests of the agriculture and food industries in Biotechnology include genetic improvement of plants, livestock and aquatic species, food processing to improve value added value and pest control in agriculture.
In the biomedical field a limited number of companies are developing and/or improving imported diagnostics.
Production of pharmaceutical agents is very limited and focuses on generic drugs.
The strategy for bioresearch in Thailand formulated by the two main funding agencies TRF and BIOTEC involves three key elements - The Biodiversity Research and Training programme (initiated in 1996), the tropical disease programme (started in 1997) and the Thailand Postgeonomics programme.
Research is in the initial stages and much more effort will be needed, including imported technology and expertise, to reach the advanced stage necessary before results can be applied commercially.
Research projects in progress include:
Dairy Cow Program:
The focus is on improved breeding programs and feed regimes.
The traditional breeding practice in Thailand has been too slow to meet national requirements.
The importation of pregnant heifers and/or young calves' quality bred from abroad is too costly.
Thai scientists are familiar with technologies such as embryo transfer, in vitro fertilization, embryo sexing and semen sexing.
However, technological and economical factors are limiting the commercial potential of this work.
Technology transfer and training of Thai researchers are required if the goal of production of high quality heifer calves is to be achieved.
DNA fingerprinting:
Work on the identification of genetic markers for production and disease traits in livestock is being carried out at the Veterinary Faculty of Kasetsart University.
This research will be used as the basis for developing diagnostic kits.
Plant related biotechnology Agricultural crop production is central to Thailand's success so it is therefore not surprising that this sector attracts the most research and development interest.
Several factors act as the stimulus for this effort, including, improving crop yield, protection of agricultural crops from diseases and pests, post harvest handling and diversification of products.
Rice Biotechnology Program:
Rice yields in Thailand are low.
Another C$1.8 million was spent on fungicides.
Molecular genetic methods are now used such as DNA fingerprinting of a blast isolate collection and mapping of host resistance genes.
• Establishment of a suitable differential cultivar series.
• Pathotype and molecular genetic characterization of the blast pathogen population in Thailand.
There are now more than 500 mono-spore isolates in the national culture collection.
• The potential of using Thai isolates of Magnaporthe grisea for development of a molecular, diagnostic tool for pathogen rice analysis.
BIOTEC, on behalf of Thailand, joined the International Collaboration for Sequencing the Rice Genome [ICSRG], Thailand's contribution is to sequence 1 Mb annually of chromosome 9 for the next five years.
Total support for this project will be C$5.5 million.
Joining ICSRG will allow Thai scientists to directly access the rest of the genome sequence.
Disease markers:
Development of bacterial wilt species is a priority in Thailand.
Presently three putative QTL's corresponding to bacterial wilt have been found.
Agriculture and Gene Engineering:
The transgenic plants are in contained greenhouses waiting field-testing.
A coat protein gene has been inserted to control papaya ring spot virus.
Chili pepper.
Chili vein-banding mottle virus a disruptive disease of chili peppers.
The transgenic plants are still in the laboratory.
A coat protein gene has been transformed into these plants for the control of cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus.
The transformation process has had more problems than in the case of other plant transformation and little progress has been made.
Support is from the government and Thailand Research Fund [TRF].
A pilot-scale production facility for production of nuclear polyhedrosis virus, Bacillus thuringiensis and B. sphericus has been established jointly between BIOTEC and the Department of Agriculture.
Nuclear polyhedrosis virus is widely used to control Spodoptera moth in the production of grapes.
Bacillus thuringiensis [BT] produced locally has gained popularity over the last few years.
Production of the bacillus has taken up the production capacities of pilot plants at Mahidol University and King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi.
Commercial production should begin in the near future.
These diseases have become progressively a more serious threat to the industry as it has expanded and intensified.
Checking for sub-clinical white-spot syndrome virus infections by PCR is now a common practice in Thailand to help farmers screen out white-spot virus post larvae before stocking.
A shrimp biotechnology service laboratory was established in July 1999 at BIOTEC to summarize the reference PCR methods for shrimp viral disease detection for Thai shrimp farms.
The objective is to serve as a reference laboratory for major shrimp pathogen diagnosis based on molecular techniques, to conduct research and to provide assistance and reagents for molecular detection of various shrimp viruses.
An industry consortium was formed in 1996 [the Shrimp Culture Research and Development Company] with the mandate to resolve problems common to the shrimp aquaculture industry.
• Attempts to manipulate the gonad inhibiting hormones (GIH) to regulate growth, maturity and reproductive success of prawns
Food processing Biotechnology has been used in baking, brewing and production of traditional foods in Thailand for centuries, but intensive R & D started only recently.
Food biotechnology is being used to enhance food quality and extend shelf life.
However, most of this work involves first generation biotechnology.
R & D in this industry is intended to solve the problems of the food processing industry, commercialize traditional processing systems, improve raw material utilization and reduce environmental impact.
Cassava and Starch Technology Tapioca starch industry is one of the largest industries in Thailand.
The program carries out R&D to improve processing efficiency, minimize waste and drive product diversification.
Biomedical Biomedical science is by far the strongest of the three roots of biotechnology in Thailand.
Major achievements from indigenous research in biomedical science in Thailand include those on both basic and clinical aspects of tropical diseases, genetics and nutrition.
Even before the advent of genetic engineering and molecular biology, Thailand has already recorded many advances in these areas at the international level.
A Rapid detection and identification of Dengue viruses via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been achieved.
A vaccine based on attenuated Dengue virus is in advanced stage of clinical trial.
In the area of biocontrol of mosquitoes, toxin genes from Bacillus thuringiensis israeliensis have been cloned and expressed from E.coli. Bacteria from mosquito-larva gut have been selected and transformed with the mosquito-lavicidal genes from various sources.
The pharmaceutical market in Thailand was worth about US$630 million in 2001.
The ethical market is slightly larger representing about 56% of the total.
Doctors are not the only ones to prescribe drugs in Thailand.
Many patients, especially those not living in Bangkok go to their local pharmacist for a prescription, and many Thai's also use oriental medicines.
Thai pharmaceutical manufactures serve mainly the domestic market and only a small number of pharmaceuticals are exported.
Thai pharmaceutical companies have a tradition of looking for products that are no longer patent protected; however, an increasing number of companies are producing under license for western multinationals.
Testing genetically modified organisms Products of biotechnology are regulated at two levels, national and institutional.
The National Biosafety Committee (NBC) was established in January 1993, Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs) at research institutes were subsequently encouraged.
Thailand's bio-safety guidelines consist of two parts, those for laboratories, and a second set for trials.
These documents are available in both Thai and English language versions.
Application for field-testing is sent to the Director General of the Department of Agriculture (DOA), MOAC, with a copy to the NBC.
The NBC will, after careful consideration of the proposal, provide its recommendation to the DOA for final consideration and approval.
The DOA has made a Ministerial Declaration under the Plant Quarantine Act that all transgenic plants are prohibited from entering the country, unless permission is granted by the Director General (DG) of DOA, and only for experimental purposes.
All relevant information and documents concerning transgenic plants (nature of genes, gene constructs, transformation process, etc.) has to be submitted to the DOA DG with a copy to BIOTEC (as NBC's secretariat).
The case may be approved or rejected depending on the joint DOA-NBC decision.

Nuggets of the Chicken Business(1) Mai 2002
Florence E. Mojica Senior Agribusiness Specialist Center for Food and Agri Business, UA&P
The Philippines is a P37-billion broiler market (equivalent to 570 million kilos of chicken).
The market has been growing at about 4 to 6% per annum over the last five years.
Small stalls and carinderias capture the rest.
Wet markets are by far the most popular source of chicken for households.
Supply and Demand Five integrators are supplying the market:
These integrators supply around 80% of the total demand; non-integrators or other commercial growers are supplying the remaining 20%.
From 1990 to 2000, the country imported almost eight million birds.
The dramatic increase in breeder chick imports in 1995 (two million birds) resulted in a bumper broiler output in 1996 and 1997.
Imports of frozen chicken come mostly from the US.
The country imported minimal amounts of frozen chicken in 1995 as many integrators pursued expansion activities owing to high demand as a result of the reduction of pork demand due to the FMD outbreak.
After the country's accession to WTO and its lifting of the quantitative restrictions in 1996, frozen imports went up dramatically in 1997 and 1998.
In 1999, imports reached a new high of 29,000 tons due to the massive entry of imported leg quarters from the US.
The current (2001) tariff for chicken meat is 45% in-quota and 60% out-quota.
FROZEN CHICKEN IMPORTATION, 1990-2001 YEAR VOLUME (Tons) VALUE (US$'000 CIF) Volume Growth (%) Value Growth (%) 1990 184 700
National Statistics Office The Philippines produces an average of 500,000 tons per year with an average annual growth of 5%.
Chicken consumption is relatively low at 6.7 kg per capita (ready-to-cook equivalent), far lower than those of Thailand and Malaysia at 11.5 kg and 27 kg, respectively.
As chicken is income-responsive, the projected growth will exceed the growth in real consumption expenditures.
PHILIPPINES:
BAS, Philippines; US Department of Agriculture
The Market The market will remain to be concentrated on foodservice and households.
Both markets have distinct preferences.
The fastfood chains require large volume delivery, mainly marinated cut-ups.
They are very strict in size and product specifications and very particular on value quality, service and reliability.
Other HRI, however requires primarily whole chicken and have more variable pricing as against the relatively stable prices of fastfood chains.
Wet markets, on the other hand, provide the daily requirement of household purchases, offering both whole chicken and cut-ups.
Wholesale prices are fluctuating while retail prices at the wet markets are inelastic.
Retailers tend to increase margin when the volume is low to provide necessary daily earnings.
Households also buy from supermarkets and hypermarts.
According to an industry source, around 10% of the volume is being sold at the supermarket level.
Supermarkets also offer housebrands, i.e., Bonus and Wow, which compete with the integrators' brands (Magnolia, Purefoods, Cooks, Swift, etc.).
What to expect?
The Philippine poultry industry will remain to be viable.
The value-added chicken products have a large potential for growth.
Chicken consumption is directly proportional to increases in income.
With the constantly growing domestic market, and growth in eating out spending, chicken consumption will move up.
There are, however, threats such as the entry of cheap chicken parts like leg quarters, low cost of production of ASEAN neighbors, new legislation and food safety and ethnic requirements (HACCP, GMP, SPS, Codex Alimentarius, ISO, Halal) which make production more costly.
What needs to be done?
The industry needs to develop and implement a road map for long-term sustainability, with the objective of providing more consistent supply of healthful and affordable protein source.
It must strive to be efficient.
While the industry can produce whole chicken competitively with low tariff on corn, competing with imported leg quarters is going to be a different ride.
At 40% tariffs in 2004, imported chicken parts will still land cheaper.
Improvement in productivity requires investment in new infrastructure and technology to keep at pace with our neighboring countries.
Compliance to international quality standards is a major step that would lead to the development of the export market.
Players should continue to implement more performance-based contract schemes with business partners or growers and raise efficiency levels through new ways of doing things.
Greater cooperation among integrators and commercial growers is necessary as well as cooperation with other parts of the value chain for better processing, storage and logistics support.
The key to a competitive poultry industry is production efficiency and least cost of production.

Bread is one of the major segments of the food processing industry.
It is typically made from flour, water and salt and then kneaded, allowed to rise, formed into loaf or another shape, and baked in an oven.
The product is available in many forms and types.
The more popular ones are: monay, ensaymada, mamon, tasty (loaf bread), pan de coco, etc.
It is added to soup (French onion soup, garlic soup) and is an integral part of cheesecake.
Bread is increasingly becoming a main part of Filipino diet.
Per capita consumption is now almost 14 kilograms per year.
Consumer Spending on Bread The latest Family Income and Expenditure Survey of the National Statistics Office (NSO) revealed a 44% increase on cereal and cereal preparations spending from P125.6 billion in 1994 to P181.1 billion in 1997.
Total expenditure grew 13% annually over the period, or approximately 5% yearly without inflation.
The bulk of cereal spending in 1997 went to rice (72%), bread (10%) and corn (8%).
Meanwhile, family spending on bread in 1997 amounted to P18 billion, up by more than P5 billion from 1994.
Annual growth stood at 11.4%.
Trade The NSO does not have a single trade classification for bread.
Instead, it categorizes the product into toasted bread, gingerbread, hopia, sweet biscuits, wafers, cakes and pies.
Philippine Trade of Bread and Pastries, 1996-2000 (Volume in tons; Value in US$'000 - FOB for exports; CIF for imports) YEAR EXPORTS IMPORTS
National Statistics Office Exports grew by an average of 70% annually to 1,100 tons (US$ 3.2 million) in 2000 from 940 kilograms (US$2.2 million) in 1996.
Sweet biscuits, waffles and wafers accounted for 70% of volume.
Taiwan (43% volume share), United States (23%), Korea (11%), and Canada (8%) were the major buyers.
SOURCE:
National Statistics Office Meanwhile, imports rose by an average of 7% yearly to 4,700 tons (US$ 7.9 million) in 2000 from 4,300 tons (US$ 11.0 million) in 1996.
Major suppliers were Indonesia (42%), Malaysia (21%), China (16%), and Singapore (6%).
These bakeries produce mainly pan de sal and loaf bread.
They are usually unable to introduce new products in bigger volumes due to the lack of modern equipment.
Meanwhile, large manufacturers invest money - from dough mixing equipment to packaging systems--for efficient bulk bread production.
Bread making today is highly mechanized to meet the increasing demand of consumers.
It offers various kinds of baked products like ensaymada, chicken pie, meringue tart, cinnamon roll, brownies and jellyroll.
The company first opened shop on May 1966.
In 1992, it diversified into food service.
To date, it has 100 outlets nationwide.
It also has branches in North America specifically California (11) and Vancouver (1).
Red Ribbon Bakeshop.
The second largest bakeshop company in the country started as a family owned business.
It caters mainly to the upper class segment and is famous for its delicious cakes and pastries.
Joni's Cakes & Pastries.
Aside, from bakeshops, the company is also into catering, meat processing, poultry-raising and vegetable farming.
It has grown rapidly since its establishment in 1981.
With 223 branches nationwide, its flour consumption amounts to over 2,000 bags a day.
In 1999, it garnered the very first Success Story of the Year award given by the Cebu Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Merced Bakeshop, The French Baker, Fortune Bakeshop, Sugarhouse Inc., Rolling Pin, Gardenia Phils., Delifrance, etc.
Its single biggest component - flour - is derived from imported wheat.
The industry is also constrained by the high perishability of the products.
The inefficient marketing system also affects product distribution.
The market has softened while operating costs have increased.
Despite these, however, majority of the large manufacturers believes that there will still be considerable growth in the medium term.
The Filipino diet has changed significantly over the last few years.
Due to the availability of convenient alternatives like bread, noodles, etc., rice is no longer as dominant in the urban diet.
There is also increased demand for healthy breads such as oatmeal, wheat, rye, multi-grain and others as more and more consumers are becoming health conscious.
Specialty breads like high fiber white bread are on the rise lately following increased patronage from consumers in the upper and middle-income classes.
People are also becoming more focused on quality and nutritional contents.
Further, the industry benefits from the government campaign on fortification of products like bread, salt, noodles, sardines and margarine.
The spread of coffee shops like Starbucks, Coffee California, Seattle's Best Coffee, etc. is expected to increase consumption of bread, a complement of coffee.
This may lead to expansion in product lines, competitive pricing, more outlets in areas outside Metro Manila and other innovative strategies and ideas, which augur well for the industry.
Finally, the growing consumer base of 76.5 million offer bright prospects on the medium term despite some short term market constraints.

A Bite of the Philippine Chocolate Industry (1)
Marie Annette S. Galvez Agribusiness Specialist Center for Food and Agri Business UA&P
Chocolate, derived from the Aztec (Central America) word xocoatl (cocoa-based drink), is made from the fruit of the cocoa (Theobroma cacao) tree.
Columbus first brought cocoa beans to Europe out of curiosity.
Today, it is one of the most exotic foods the whole world enjoys.
Chocolate confectionery refers to pre-packed chocolate bars, bites and candies made primarily from cocoa powder and/or butter, mixed with powdered milk and sugar.
In the Asia Pacific region, chocolate sales are estimated at $3.9 billion.
The Philippines accounts for less than 3% ($111 million) of the total (Van Melle, Phils., 1998).
These already included sales in duty-free shops.
Moreover, in the 1997 Family Income and Expenditure Survey, spending on chocolates and candies reached P3 billion with regular buyers from middle to high-income urban families.
The purchases usually surge during the holiday (i.e. Christmas) season.
Types of Chocolates The processing of chocolates begins with the mixing of cocoa powder with sugar, milk, cocoa butter and flavoring before refining.
The mixture then undergoes conching, a flavor developing procedure until the right consistency is reached.
At this point, different by-products - compound (pure) and chocolate - are attained.
Chocolate products are classified into bars, bite-size, panned and enrobed depending on the size and/or ingredients.
Enrobed Coated biscuits, wafers, nuts, caramel, fruits and other fondant confections SOURCE:
So, Wendy.
April 2001 (UA & P).
Trade Imports of chocolate confectionery were volatile during 1996 to 2000, peaking at 5,810 tons ($24.2 million) in 1997 and lowest at 3,670 tons ($15 million) in 2000.
Philippine Trade of Chocolate Confectionery, 1996-2000 (Volume in tons, Value in US$'000 - FOB for exports, CIF for imports)
National Statistics Office The US was the major source in 2000 with a 60% volume share.
Other sources were Australia and Malaysia.
The US-imported chocolates in the market include Hershey's Kisses, M&M milk chocolates and peanuts, Mars, Three Musketeers, Snickers, Milky Way, and Babyruth.
Imports from Australia and Switzerland are Cadbury and Lindt and Toblerone, respectively.
Also in the market are Malaysian products such as Van Houten, Gandour's Pik-One and Sahara.
Those from Saudi Arabia include Tofiluk, Safari and Soudan.
Exports, on the other hand, generated a total of about US$14 million over the five-year period.
Among the leading buyers were Malaysia, Korea and USA.
URC captures about one-third (in volume) of the chocolate market.
Among the best sellers are Cloud 9 Classic and Cloud 9 Chooey Choco.
Other brands include Big Bang and Nips.
Commonwealth Foods, Inc.
The company started in 1951 with coffee as the main product.
About 60% of sales come from Manila and the remaining from the provinces.
It manufactures Ricoa Chocolates with the following brands Roll-O-Nut, Flat Tops, Curly Tops, RicoNut and Big Top.
Serg's Products, Inc.
The country's oldest and Southeast Asia's first modern chocolate confectionery manufacturer.
It started in 1954 selling chocolates in Divisoria (a trading center).
At present, its chocolate processing plant has a capacity of 7 tons/day.
Among the best selling products are its panned Moonbits chocolates and bite-size Egg chocolates.
The company's market belongs to the middle- and low- income segments.
Goya, Inc.
It manages the confectionery business of the latter since 1997.
It has a wide target market and offers varied products, both imported and local.
Its chocolate products are subdivided into four categories: adult, teen, kid and family.
Among its popular products are Goya, Crunch and KitKat.
Issues and Concerns A key concern is the high input costs, i.e., sugar and cocoa beans, which are imported, and packaging materials.
The industry heavily relies on imports since supply is scant.
The increasing influx of imported chocolates is also a growing challenge to the local industry.
In a country with relatively low incomes, these can dramatically affect demand.
In order to address these concerns, the industry must improve product quality through product development, new investment and increase in production efficiency.
Thus far, there have been efforts to adopt computer aided-design and -manufacturing processes including bar coding, thus, enhancing productivity.
Prospects One of the competitive edges of the local manufacturers is the ability to cater to the large low-income segment (about 70% of the 15 million households) with low-priced retail packs.
Thus, expanding product lines, improving distribution networks along with the growing young population will drive demand in the years to come.

Seasoning for All Seasons (1)
Senen U. Reyes Senior Management Specialist Center for Food and Agri Business UA&P
The Filipino penchant for food is none the more manifested by our festive nature.
Despite economic difficulties, we love to fiesta and party even on short notice.
We even use the most trivial occasions to get together and celebrate.
One reason for our love for food is the condiment and seasoning that go with it.
One would always find a match: mangga at bagoong, chicharon and vinegar, kare-kare at alamang, lumpia and vinegar with garlic, pansit and soy sauce with kalamansi or a mix of vinegar, soy sauce, kalamansi with chili pepper as dipping sauce for fried, grilled, steamed, or roasted meat, fish, and seafood.
Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines condiment in three ways.
One, a condiment is something usually pungent, acid, salty, or spicy added to or served with food to enhance its flavor or to give added flavor.
Thus, condiments are related to or synonymous to seasoning.
Second, it is an appetizing and usually pungent substance of natural origin (as pepper, vinegar, or mustard).
Third, condiments are any of various complex compositions having similar qualities (as curry or chili powder, pickles, or catsup).
Products Webster's definition aptly describes the local condiments industry.
The wide range of products include tomato ketchup, banana sauce, fish sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, salt, pepper, monosodium glutamate, liquid seasoning, broth cubes, garlic, ginger, mayonnaise, mustard, sweet and sour sauce, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, barbecue sauce, lechon sauce, wasabe, and food mixes.
Most of these condiments can be used as seasoning, flavoring, dipping sauce, preservative, dressing, soup stock base, and marinate.
There are four major condiments regularly found in the Filipinos' kitchen and dining table: fish sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, and ketchup.
There are several variants to these condiments.
Fish sauce, a common condiment in Asia, is made from the liquid drained off by fermenting fish with salt in large barrels or vats.
It is locally called patis and is known as nam pla in Thailand and nuoc mam in Vietnam.
Fish sauce is available in both premium quality and low grade.
However, fish sauce is not a common seasoning in the Visayas as the locals are bound to give soy sauce when one asks for fish sauce.
Soy sauce is a salty, dark colored liquid produced from a mixture of fermented soybeans and roasted grain.
There is light and dark soy sauce as well as a variant with kalamansi known as toyomansi available in the market.
Vinegar from the French vin aigre (sour wine) is made by bacterial activity that converts fermented liquids into a weak solution of acetic acid.
Vinegar can be made from sugarcane, coconut, nipa palm, malt, pineapple, and rice.
It usually has a banana or tomato foundation and is available in classic, original, and sweet blends.
Demand The National Statistics Office-Family Income and Expenditures Survey (FIES) revealed that in 1994, Filipino households spent P11 billion for sauces, salt, and other spices and seasoning.
This grew to P16 billion in 1997.
Households from the NCR, Southern Tagalog, and Central Luzon were the leading buyers of these commodities.
(Note:
The 2000 survey will be released soon).
Total spending, however, has not been indicative of per capita consumption as the figures were highest in the Mindanao regions particularly Western and Northern Mindanao.
This is more a reflection of the economic situation in Mindanao where families use condiments as viand.
Many of the country's poorest provinces are in the area.
From 1996 to 2000, industry sources estimate that soy sauce had the highest average annual growth rate at 12% followed by fish sauce (10%) and vinegar (3%).
Total soy sauce demand in 2000 approximated 40,000 cases per day while vinegar had 20% less than soy sauce and fish sauce 40% less than soy sauce.
This excludes producers of unbranded products and fakes.
Datu Puti and Nelicom have 10-12% share.
Datu Puti and Amihan have 80% of the market.
Silver Swan, Marca Piña, and Datu Puti dominate the soy sauce market with 75-80% share.

Trade The country is a net exporter of condiments.
It has a positive trade balance in the four major condiments of over 6,600 tons in 1996 going down to 5,300 tons in 2000.
Major exports reached over 8,300 tons in 1996 but have since dropped to less than 7,800 tons in the last three years.
Imports, on the other hand, increased from a little over 1,600 tons in 1996 to over 2,200 tons in 2000.
Imports have effectively increased as a percentage of exports from 20% in 1996 to 30% in 2000.
The industry, however, does not perceive the increased growth of imports as an immediate threat.
Demand for imports basically come from the high-end market, which is only 1-2% of total volume.
Soy sauce is the country's major export accounting for 37-39% of total volume followed by vinegar.
It is also the leading import with 60-85% of total volume.

Prospects The industry is characterized by the presence of many players, as there are basically no barriers to entry.
The producers of fake/adulterated mixtures sold at cheaper prices compound this.
There is also minimal product differentiation, the threat of imports particularly from ASEAN competitors, and the growing health consciousness away from salty and carcinogenic substances.
Despite these negative factors, it is perceived that the condiment industry will thrive in good times and in bad times.
It has been part of the Filipinos' eating habit and culture for generations.
In times of prosperity, people are bound to eat more and eat out which will drive demand for condiments.
In the same way, economic difficulties will still sustain demand given the people's tendency to add more taste and flavoring to rice considering the limited budget for meat, fish, and vegetables.
The growing population of the country coupled with the demand for instant noodles is seen as positive signs for the condiment industry.
Over the short to medium term, the local condiment industry is expected to enjoy a relatively stable demand.

Cutflowers in Gloom (1)
Rosalie B. Bernardino Researcher Center for Food and Agri Business University of Asia and the Pacific
Cutflowers are blooms cut from the plant and are sold commercially.
They are classified as fresh, dried, dyed or bleached.
Cutflowers are used for corsages, wreaths, or special flower arrangements.
They also serve as additives in perfume processing and other industrial purposes.
Production Almost 1,600 hectares are devoted to cutflower production in the country.
The major varieties grown are gladiola, daisy, rose, orchid, anthurium and chrysanthemum.
Other types are statice, baby's breath, aster, sampaguita, and ilang-ilang.
Most are produced in Benguet.
Packaging sizes vary.
Some are expressed in dozens, others in bundles, tons and pieces.
Combined production of rose, daisy, gladiola, orchid, chrysanthemum and anthurium in 2000 reached 12 million dozens from 10 million dozens in 1999.
Rose and daisy dominate with 30% and 21% share in 2000, respectively.
From 1991-2000, rose production increased by 7% per annum with average produce of 3 million dozens per year from an average planted area of 156 hectares.
In 2000, production went up by almost 60% to 3.6 million dozens from 2.3 million dozens in 1999.
Seventy percent (70%) of the total blooms came from Benguet.
For the past ten years, production of daisy reached an average of 2 million dozens per annum.
Harvest stood at 2.5 million dozens in 2000, with 46% coming from Caraga.
Gladiola production dropped by 5% per year from 1991 to 2000.
In 1996, production fell by 80% to 1.9 million dozens from 9.7 million dozens in 1995, following the drop in area planted by 36% to 407 hectares from 636 hectares.
Benguet was the major producer with 82% of the total harvest in 2000.
Average orchid output for the past ten years was 1.4 million dozens, increasing by almost 13% per annum.
Meanwhile, production in 2000 fell by almost 3% to 1.9 million dozens.
Southern Mindanao produced 41% of the total production while Western Visayas produced 26%.
Annual chrysanthemum production from 1991 to 2000 was 2.8 million dozens, experiencing a 5% drop per year.
Harvests in 2000 rose by 36% to 1.8 million dozens from 1.3 million dozens in 1999.
Major producers in 2000 were Central Visayas at 48% and Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) at 40%.
During the ten-year period, anthurium production grew by 13% per annum with 268,000 dozens of flowers yearly.
Southern Mindanao and CAR were the leading producers with shares of 27% and 25%, respectively.
Baby's breath and statice production stood at one million bundles in 2000, with the former comprising seventy one (71%).
Average production of baby's breath was 590,000 bundles, up by 14% per year from 1991-2000.
Production slightly declined in 2000 to 757,000 bundles from 765,000 bundles the previous year.
The bulk of output came from Western Visayas and CAR at 73% and 37%, respectively.
About 420,000 bundles of statice were harvested annually from 1991 to 2000.
Production went up by 3% to 307,000 bundles in 2000 from 298,000 bundles in 1999.
Benguet, where almost all of the harvest came from; and Pampanga, which produced only 60 bundles in 2000.
Aster and sampaguita production reached 576 tons in 2000, down by 56% from 1,301 tons in 1999.
Aster production declined by 7% yearly in the past ten years, averaging 800 tons per year.
Production in 2000 plunged by 69% to 284 tons from 914 tons in 1999, with Southern Tagalog as major producer (77% of total harvest).
From 1991 to 2000, sampaguita production increased by 9% per year, averaging 246 tons annually.
Output declined by 25% in 2000 to 292 tons from 387 tons a year ago.
More than 51% of the total flowers came from Southern Tagalog while the Bicol Region produced 36%.
About 112,000 pieces of ilang-ilang were harvested yearly from 1991 to 2000.
Production in 2000 reached 232,000 pieces, with 88% coming from La Union.
According to an industry player, local production is not enough to supply the domestic market.
Cutflowers:
Volume of Production, Philippines, 1991-2000
Bureau of Agricultural Statistics
Trade The country is both an exporter and importer of cutflowers.
The cutflower industry contributes over half a million dollars annually to the country's economy.
Exports, comprising of fresh and dried flowers, averaged 126 tons per year from 1991-2000.
Shipments increased by 3% annually.
Fresh exports averaged 93 tons per year during the ten-year period.
A slight decline was registered in 2000 to 104 tons from 105 tons in 1999.
Meanwhile, the country shipped an annual average of 32 tons of dried cutflowers during the same period.
In 2000, exports dipped by 75% to 15 tons from 60 tons the previous year.
Total cutflower exports stood at 119 tons in 2000, down by 28% from 166 tons in 1999.
Eighty seven percent (87%) were fresh and 13% dried.
According to an industry player, some exporters have been turning to the domestic market since prices have been relatively favorable.
Others also have difficulty meeting the standards of importing countries.
In 2000, Japan was the biggest buyer of fresh cutflowers and Netherlands for dried cutflowers.
Philippine Exports of Cutflowers Volume in tons, Value in US$ FOB YEAR Fresh Dried
National Statistics Office (NSO) By contrast, imports for the past ten years have been growing at 21% per year, averaging 122 tons annually.
More than 84% of the total imports in 2000 were fresh and the rest were dried.
On the average, the country imported 112 tons yearly of fresh cutflowers and 110 tons annually of dried flowers from 1991-2000.
Fresh imports reached 110 tons in 2000, almost 50% lower than the previous year's 212 tons.
Meanwhile, dried imports decreased 18% to 20 tons in 2000 from 25 tons in 1999.
Thailand was the major source for both for fresh and dried cutflowers.

Marketing Cutflowers are sold locally to individual buyers, groups/traders who distribute the flowers to demand centers, and institutional buyers such as hotels, restaurants, funeral parlors, supermarkets, flower shops, boutiques and street vendors.
In Manila, there are wholesaler-retailers who operate in places like Quiapo, Baclaran, and Dangwa in Divisoria.
Prices vary according to type, quality, size, length of stem and variety.
For instance, the longer the stalk, the higher the price.
Those sold in flower shops command higher prices due to better quality, presentation, packaging and handling services.
Prices are usually high during the peak months of February (Valentine's Day) and November (All Saints' Day).
On the other hand, Japan, Korea and Netherlands are the biggest buyers in the export market.
Key Players The big players in the cutflower industry include:
Dole Tropifresh, a division of Dole Philippines, Inc., Davao Flowers, Inc., Puentespina Orchids and Tropical Plants, Inc., Philippine Cutflower Corporation, Flower Farm Corp., Derling Worldwide Orchids, King Louie Farms, Sul Orchids.
Key Concerns Small producers growing highly diversified crops dominate the industry.
Only few large-scale commercial growers are effectively targeting export markets.
Some growers are also having difficulty in meeting the volume and quality requirements of foreign markets, mainly because of lack of expertise and proper planning.
Cutflowers are highly perishable and very fragile.
Thus, proper harvesting, packaging and handling are critical.
Prospects Despite the insufficient supply of cutflowers in the local market, prospects seem gloomy due to the current economic slowdown.
Local demand could drop because they are not a basic commodity.
Plenty of growers are also venturing in this industry, hence, higher market competition for existing growers.
On the other hand, some growers prefer to sell locally than abroad due to higher market price and lower costs.

Market Information Southeast Asia
An Update on the Philippine  Fastfood Industry (1)
The phenomenal growth is seen through the swift expansion of different food chains in Metro Manila, key cities and provinces.
Higher disposable incomes and fast changing lifestyles are among the drivers.
Income per family for many households has increased and a large part of it is spent on food.
More Filipinos are also working, including mothers.
This means less time to cook meals and clean dishes.
More and more Filipinos eat less at home.
It has been observed that five (5) out of ten (10) Filipinos who eat out goes to fastfood chains, three (3) to fine dining restaurants and the rest go to bakeshops and small food outlets.
Fastfoods became popular because they are convenient places where one gets hot meals fast at affordable prices.
Industry Performance There is an estimated 50,000 restaurants in the country.
The eating out spending of families, excluding corporate representation expenses, is currently valued at almost P90 billion (approximately $1.8 billion) with an average growth of 15% to 20% per annum over the last ten years.
However, growth slowed down since 1998 following the Asian financial crisis.
The past five years saw the entry of many food players.
Local store chains keep on expanding in major urban areas, while foreign food outlets are coming in.
In 2000, thirty five percent (35%) of foreign franchises are in the food business.
Meanwhile, local franchises have gone international like Red Ribbon Bakeshop, Max's Fried Chicken, Josephine's Restaurant, and Jollibee.
Food Spending The food spending pattern of Filipino families continued to increase but its share to total spending had declined.
Food consumed at home comprised 38.3%, a decline from 39.2% in 1997.
By contrast, the share of eating out to total spending increased from 4.7% in 1997 to 4.9% in 2000.
Percentage Distribution of Total Family Spending
The entry of new players is proof that it is on the uptrend despite the economic slowdown.
Growth translates to competition especially among the different categories of the food service business.
In the quick service restaurant (fastfood) segment, the total market in 2000 was over P30 billion.
Core Companies The dominant players in the fastfood industry are Jollibee, McDonald's, Wendy's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Kenny Rogers Roasters, Pizza Hut, Greenwhich and Chowking.
It is also being endorsed by one of the country's popular actor.
Its main target is the kids.
The company's food is well loved by Filipinos because of its distinctly Filipino taste.
It started out as a two-branch ice cream parlor in 1975 and was incorporated three years later, expanding into fastfood operations with the aim of providing Filipino consumers freshly cooked, high quality and affordable food.
The company is 100 percent Filipino owned with Tony Tan Caktiong as president and chief operating officer.
It has managed to attain market dominance despite the presence of foreign food service giants.
It acquired Greenwich Pizza in 1994 and Chowking Foods Corp., the country's top oriental food chain, in 2000.
Now, it has more than 400 outlets nationwide.
It also expanded overseas and has outlets in the Middle East, US West Coast, Brunei and Indonesia.
It has a big commissary in Pasig City, which has its own hotdog making line and meat processing line for burger patties.
McDonalds The company, with franchise holder McGeorge Food Industries Inc., holds 28% of the fastfood market.
Established in 1981, it took George Yang, McGeorge's president, 15 years to build the first 100 stores in the country.
Presently, it has 235 outlets nationwide.
It does not have its own meat processing line because it taps another company, Genosi Inc.
(a subsidiary of Alaska Milk), for its requirement.
With 48 stores in Luzon, it has an 8-9% share of the market.
All stores outside the shopping malls operate 24 hours a day.
Kentucky Fried Chicken It was established in the country in 1967.
Two successive companies managed the chain before Ramcar Inc. finally acquired it.
It has 78 outlets nationwide.
Kenny Rogers' Roasters It was introduced in the country in 1995 and has managed to open 27 stores.
(Prieto Family).
Established in the country in 1975, it controls around 25% of the local pizza market.
Jollibee acquired it in 1994.
Presently, it has around 200 branches nationwide.
It has 164 outlets nationwide.
It plans to put up more stores abroad after successfully opening stores in the US and the Middle East.
Supporting Industries and Services Given the tight competition in the industry, players buy their ingredients from the best and cheapest sources available.
They directly negotiate with producers, manufacturers and distributors for food, beverage and packaging products to ensure freshness and uniform quality at competitive prices.
The industry has become a lucrative market for the agriculture and food manufacturing sectors as well as other food import firms.
Dairy Products Corp., Kraft Foods, Purefoods, General Milling, Goldilocks and Nestle Corp. Many raw materials and ingredients, however, have to be imported.
These include beef, potato, cheese and other dairy items that are not available in the country.
Local beef supply is not adequate while local potatoes are not good enough for French fries processing.
The local food chains seldom export.
The commonly exported products for their overseas branches are cooking equipment and utensils that are specifically made for their products.
Support Providers Support providers are the government agencies, academe and the private sector.
Government support in agriculture affects the industry since farming is part of the supply chain.
The government agencies include the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Trade and Industry, Securities and Exchange Commission, the local government units that issue building permits and other agencies involved in the environmental and social permits.

An Update on the Philippine  Fastfood Industry
Ana Cecilia S. Palma Researcher Center for Food and Agri Business UA&P
(Second of Two Parts)
There are different kinds of gimmicks like a toy in every set meal for kids, discounted food items if you purchase two items, free gift items, raffle draws and a lot more.
Some food companies even get celebrity endorsers to create brand consciousness and market loyalty.
Price cuts and discounts are offered to increase sales.
Food outlets that offer the most value for money (less than P100/ meal) are the popular ones.
Quality of Food, Service and Facilities.
Providing high quality food that conforms to the taste of the consumer coupled with fast and efficient service in a clean environment is a big incentive to growth.
Malls, university areas, and other places where there is heavy pedestrian traffic are the usual places where food outlets are highly patronized.
It is a risk to take as malls charge high rentals.
Due to the economic crisis, many are also closing their unprofitable outlets.
The smooth operations of food outlets require a steady and adequate supply of raw materials.
Market niching is key.
Entrants must strive to project an image that can shift brand loyalty from existing players.
A well-managed logistics support system is required to run several local operations.
Aggressive marketing is required to make a strong impact.
Exit Barriers.
The food equipment are quite expensive; their use is also specialized.
Government Policies The government has taken an active role in cultivating an environment that would allow the local food service industry to be globally competitive and to operate at levels comparable to international standards.
The industry is subject to rules and regulations promulgated by government agencies establishing reasonable standards of quality for food products.
Specifically, the Department of Health (DOH) together with the Bureau of Food and Drugs are mandated to ensure that food sold and distributed to the general public are safe for human consumption.
The DOH, upon presentation of appropriate authorization to the owner or operator of any food establishment, is authorized to enter and inspect its equipment, raw materials, containers and storage facilities to ensure that the food manufactured and served in such establishments are fit for human consumption.
Meanwhile, the Department of Trade and Industry approves advertising campaigns of the food outlets.
Its attached agency, the Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology Transfer (BPTTT), is authorized to do the following: a) register trademarks, service marks and other marks of ownership; and b) hear and adjudicate contested proceedings affecting the right to trademarks.
Further, all franchise agreements with foreign franchisors are registered with the BPTTT as well as licensing, technical assistance and services, technology transfer and distribution agreements.
Medium Term Prospects The medium-term outlook, i.e. the next five years, for the Philippine food service industry appears cautiously optimistic.
Majority is skewed towards the younger age brackets representing an increase in potential demand;
• The expansion of malls which influence and allow greater access of consumers to the food service industry;
• With the increased number of players, it may not be surprising to find mergers or the diversification of several firms from different industry segments.
Jollibee used this strategy when it acquired Greenwich Pizza in 1994 and Chowking, the country's leading Chinese food chain.

Challenges and Opportunities (1)
Rolando T. Dy,  Executive Director and CFA Staff Center for Food and Agri Business University of Asia and the Pacific
Agriculture continued to grow in 2001 with a 2.4% uptick in the first three months.
Our full year estimate at 3.5% to 4% in November 2000 held water.
This 2001, we foresee agricultural growth to fall between 2.5%-3.5%.
PERFORMANCE IN 2000 Agriculture grew by 3.5% in 2000.
The main growth drivers were palay, coconut, banana, a few minor crops, livestock, and poultry.
Crops Palay.
2000 was a growth year for rice as it posted a 5.1% gain to 12.4 million tons, the highest level ever.
Increased use of good seeds, improved irrigation, sufficient rainfall and intensive use of fertilizers brought this about.
Rice stocks at the start of the lean months would be about 2.2 M tons that translates to about 94 days' consumption at 24,000 tons per day.
This is equivalent to the required buffer stock.
Corn.
Corn output was 2% off from last year at 4.5 M tons from 4.6 M tons.
Crop shifting, unfavorable weather, pests and other problems in the first quarter contributed to the fall.
In 2000, heavy wheat imports were resorted to bridge the corn shortage.
About 2.6 M tons of wheat for food and feed was imported of which only 148,244 tons was feed wheat.
Total corn imports, on the other hand, reached 450,000 tons for the whole year.
Coconut.
After back to back weather disturbances (El Niño and La Niña), coconut production in nut terms grew 14.5% over 1999.
The United Coconut Associations of the Philippines (UCAP), on the other hand, placed copra production at 2.48 M tons from 1.38 M tons in 1999.
Exports of coconut oil reached almost 1 M tons in 2000.
The increased production pulled down prices as coconut oil fell to $300-325 per ton from an average of $700 a year ago amid oversupply in the vegetable oil market.
This placed farmgate copra at P2-4 per kilogram.
The sustained decline in prices has been caused by the following: record breaking harvests of rapeseed and oil palm fruits; rise in global export availabilities of sunflowerseed and coconut oil; ample end-of-season stocks; India's decision to raise import duties on vegetable oil; possibility of other countries following China's policy to favor imports of seeds over oil purchases; and outlook for another abundant harvest of high-oil-yielding crops in 2000/01.
Sugar.
Another factor attributed to the slow growth is the shift of sugarcane farmers to other crops particularly in Tarlac.
Sugarcane posted a positive growth in the last quarter of 2000 after consistently showing decreases in the first three quarters of the year.
Banana.
Production growth accelerated in 2000 to 8% from 5.9% in 1999.
Better weather conditions coupled with good crop maintenance and increases in bearing plants propelled growth.
The expanding China market also encouraged production expansions especially in Mindanao, which account for about 80% of the country's total banana production.
Other crops.
Representing a mixed bag of fruits, vegetables and tree crops, the other crops account for about a fourth of total agricultural production.
This group posted recovery in 2000 with growth of 2.8%, a big turnaround from the 4.5% decline in 1999.
The gainers include abaca, tomato, garlic, cabbage, eggplant, calamansi, cotton, other fibercrops and others.
Expansions were brought about by a combination of factors: favorable weather conditions, availability of planting materials and increases in area planted.
Livestock The subsector comprising mainly hogs, cattle and carabao posted a moderate growth of 3.1 percent in 2000.
Carabao produced the highest output gain of 4.2% while hog production grew by 3.5%.
Likewise dairy production was up by 3.6% due to the increment in number of milking animals in cooperative dairy farms.
Poultry Poultry grew further by 5.4% from the 0.1% it recorded in 1999.
Chicken production grew by 6.3% while chicken eggs production increased by 5.9% as a result of increments in inventory of commercial layers.
Fishery and Aquaculture The sector grew by 1.7%.
Aquaculture and municipal fisheries were the lead gainers.
Among the growth factors were: rehabilitation of fishponds and fishcages, availability and use of good-quality fingerlings, increased stocking rate, declaration of fish sanctuaries, and dispersal of carp and tilapia fingerlings.
Forestry The sector posted a negative growth of 16.8% due to the continued enforcement of log ban.
AGRICULTURE GROWTH, 2000 (in percent) Product/Industry group 1st half 2nd half ANNUAL Palay 3.2 6.7 5.1 Corn -6.4 2.5 -1.6 Coconut including copra 16.1 12.8 14.2 Sugarcane -7.3 19.8 0.9 Banana 11.4 4.7 8.0 Other Crops 3.4 2.2 2.8 Livestock 2.2 3.9 3.1 Poultry 5.4 5.4 5.4 Agri activities and services 3.3 5.5 4.4 Fishery 0.8 2.6 1.7 Forestry -18.4 -13.8 -16.8 GVA in agriculture, fishery and forestry 2.3 4.5 3.4 Note:

National Income Accounts (as of January 2001), National Statistical Coordination Board
This is close to the revised Medium Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP) estimate of agricultural growth of 2.5% - 3.3% for 2001.
This revised figure is based on projected increases in palay and corn production, two of the country's major crops, following higher investments in irrigation and adoption of new technologies.
Other subsectors are expected to post increases as well.
Palay production may be flat in 2001 due to reduced plantings with expected low rainfall in the second half.
Rainfed areas will experience reduced yields.
The first semester outcome will be positive (2.8%) as good weather conditions still prevail.
The second semester will be negative in the fourth quarter with the likely El Niño onset in the third.
An upside factor is the delay of the El Niño to the fourth quarter given the June rains brought by tropical depressions Darna and Emong.
The preparedness and anticipation of the Department of Agriculture can also negate the effects of a mild El Niño.
However, the depreciating peso will continue to put pressure on farm incomes as input prices will stay on the high side.
Given the beginning stock, a positive production in the first half (3.6 M tons rice equivalent), and a 90-day buffer stock by June 30, 2001, the country contracted and brought in imports close to 800,000 tons ($120 M landed cost).
Last year, the NFA imported a little over 600,000 tons.
Industry sources revealed that palay prices were slightly lower (up to 5%) from January to April 2001 compared to the same period last year.
Farmgate prices fell below P8.00. The main culprit was the early entry of imported rice.
It also claimed that smuggled rice provided additional supply and contained prices.
This will have dampening effects on farm income.
The BAS estimated first quarter growth at 6.3% due to favorable weather, fertilization, and hybrid seeds.
An 11.3% fall in the second quarter from reduced area and yield will bring first half corn 2.3% lower than 2000.
A 4.6% pick up in the second half will bring the full year corn growth at 1.6%.
A 3% growth in the first half and 5% in the second half are likely.
The production growth of coconut as well as those of other vegetable oils would likely sustain the depressed world market prices the current levels exerting a downward push on farmgate prices.
Some mills have limited operations due to a world oversupply of vegetable oils and stiff competition in shipping space to overseas destination.
For the first quarter of 2001, sugarcane production recovered significantly by 4.9%.
Full year growth, however, is expected to slow down to 5%-6% from last year's 8%.
Soft export prices in Japan, the country's biggest market, may temper the planned expansions by banana growers in Southern Mindanao amid hopes over the growing China market.
In 2000 alone, Japan (including Okinawa) absorbed about 60% of the country's banana exports while China (including Taiwan), 23%.
(Note:
There is now a glut in the Japanese market owing to good production in Mindanao and the influx of bananas from Latin America, which failed to sell a big chunk of its produce to the European Union over tariff issues.
The situation is expected to cut Philippine export prices of $2.60 per 13-kilogram box in the next several months).
Production for the first quarter grew by 1.8%.
For the whole year, growth is projected at 3%-4%, as most crops (e.g. pineapple, mango, etc.) sustain gains posted during the first quarter.
Increases will be brought about by improved weather conditions, better market demand, area expansion, etc.
Livestock Livestock production grew by 2.6% during the first quarter of 2001.
Growth is expected at 4%.
Moderate growth of the sector can be attributed to the slow growth in hog population due to the possible closure of inefficient farms.
The rising cost of production is tempering attempts to expand operations.
Cattle output will continue to slow down due to decreasing importation and weak demand brought about by the "mad cow disease" scare and more so now, weak purchasing power.
Poultry For the first quarter of 2001, poultry production grew by 4.3%.
A growth of 5% in the first half and 5.5% in the second half are likely as integrators are now into production expansion plus positive effect of mad cow.
The impact of industry consolidation (SMFI and Purefoods) is difficult to quantify.
Fishery and Aquaculture The sector is expected to grow by 3%-4% in 2001.
This is an improvement from the 1.7% growth in 2000.
Recoveries are expected from aquaculture, municipal and commercial fisheries.
By now, production growth is 3.0% in the first quarter.
Favorable weather conditions, rehabilitation of sanctuaries, modern equipment and technologies will facilitate production growth.
Seaweed will still be the supply driver due to expansion in production areas and good weather.
Our full year estimate is between 2.5%-3.5%.
2001 is a good year quantity-wise but poor price-wise especially for palay and copra.
Rural purchasing power is down.
The Abu Sayyaf problem and the spate of kidnappings, while not directly affecting agriculture, are not helping the economy to recover.
The high foreign exchange rate continues to put prices of agricultural inputs on the high side.
This does not bode well for domestic and export competitiveness.
Let's hope the incoming Congress can come up with measures to address this.
Watch out for 2002 when agricultural production will likely fall due to drought.
The government must be prepared for the adverse impact on food security and rural incomes.
Appropriate cash releases are imperative for quick yielding infrastructure and support services.

A Precious Find? (1)
Senen U. Reyes Senior Management Specialist Center for Food and Agri Business, UA&P and Angelica J. Aquino Student Intern from Central Luzon State University
Golden rice or genetically altered rice is touted as a symbol of all the goodness biotech has to offer.
It appears unusual in that it is very pale yellow in color, a sign of all the beta-carotene that the inventors have managed to pack into the grains.
The nutrients it contains can help avoid vitamin A deficiency (VAD) - related diseases, including irreversible blindness in hundreds of thousands of children yearly, particularly among poor families.
The Development of Golden Rice Golden rice is the first research sample of vitamin enriched crop.
It is genetically modified, containing beta-carotene and other carotenoids.
Dr. Ingo Potrykus, a professor of plant science at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology together with his chief collaborator Peter Beyer of the University of Freiburg in Germany, developed the controversial golden rice.
The Rockfeller Foundation (1991-2002), the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (1993-1996), the European Union under a European Community Biotech Programme (1996-2000) and the Swiss Federal Office for Education and Science (1996-2000) financially supported the technology used in developing this rice.
Dr. Potrykus' invention started with a typical strain of white rice whose embryo was added with some DNA from daffodils and a bacterium.
The goal of Dr. Potrykus when he used genetic engineering to improve rice nutritional content was to fight the growing rate of malnutrition especially of people who depend on rice as their major staple.
It was also intended to lower the risk degree of VAD and the health problem that result from it.
At the local front, PhilRice Supervising Science Research Specialist Thelma Padolina indicated that "we will be using golden rice in incorporating our breeding program but for sure we will be following the guidelines of the National Biosafety Committee."
According to her, biotechnology is a tool for plant breeding and she has a positive stand about this because it is one way to avert hunger and to become self-sufficient.
PhilRice has 30 grains of this transgenic rice transferred through a memorandum of agreement by IRRI and Dr. Potrykus.
The institution is now conducting studies using golden rice as parental material for breeding and to hybridize other rice varieties.
Some constraints prevent golden rice from being readily acceptable here in the Philippines.
One, it is not adaptable to our climate because it is a Japonica type of rice which is mostly grown in temperate countries like Japan and the second is because of the very rigid multi-location testing necessary before it can be approved as a variety.
Biochemical Components As discussed earlier, rice grains do not contain beta-carotene.
But scientists recently identified the biochemical pathway required in the production of beta-carotene in the rice endosperm, the edible part of the grain.
Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) which is the only known precursor substance available in the rice endosperm is where the process starts.
However, the GGPP still cannot be converted into beta-carotene because the enzymes needed in this process are not inherently available in the rice.
So, Dr. Potrykus and his team introduced foreign genes that will encode these enzymes and make them work in synchrony.
The group genetically modified the Taipei 309-rice variety with two genes from daffodils and a gene from the bacterium Erwinia uredovora was introduced to complete the pathway.
The product was genetically modified rice that produced pale yellow colored kernels-courtesy of beta-carotene accumulation.
Health Benefits vs. Hazards In rice eating populations, malnutrition is said to be high.
In the Philippines, for instance, national estimates on the prevalence of malnutrition in 1998 among preschoolers and schoolchildren revealed the following:
5 years old & below 6-10 years old
% Absolute Figure % Absolute Figure Moderately
Food and Nutrition Research Institute-Department of Science and Technology Various deficiencies including zinc, Vitamin C and D, folate, riboflavin, selenium and calcium occur in the context of poverty, environmental degradation, lack of proper education and social disparity.
These underlying issues can never be addressed by golden rice.
Vitamin A deficiency is the cause of blindness of seventeen Filipino children everyday.
Maternal night blindness, which is a symptom of VAD, also afflicts 18% of laborers and unskilled workers and 16% of farmers, forestry workers and fishermen.
In the developing world, VAD is responsible for 250,000 cases of irreversible blindness every year.
It is also the leading cause of child death, diarrhea, measles and pneumonia.
About 124 million children worldwide have VAD.
Poor families particularly in Asia consume rice as a staple; babies are often fed on rice gruel.
Unfortunately, the grains of rice lack beta-carotene, which is the source of vitamin A. It is present in the leaves and stem, but none in the grain endosperm.
And no amount of traditional breeding has been able to get it there.
Vitamin A supply where rice is a staple Source: www.grain.com In an interview, Dr. Potrykus said, "If some people decide that they want blind children and white rice, it's their choice.
I'm offering the possibility of yellow rice and no blind children.
Offering the golden rice seeds for humanitarian purposes was not as easy as Dr. Potrykus thought it would be.
The golden rice has caused many speculations from environmental campaigners who continue to reject modern biotechnology researches and products of genetic engineering.
"Golden Rice is fools' gold" - this is the Greenpeace group's belief.
Because of the risk involved that still cannot be properly assessed at the present state of scientific knowledge, anti-GM activists oppose any release of GMOs into the environment.
According to environmental campaigners, if we allow this golden rice and depend on it for nutrition, an adult would need to eat 3.75 kilograms of dry rice, roughly 9 kilograms of cooked rice for daily requirement of vitamin A. Children around the world would also lose knowledge of the importance of other crops such as green leafy vegetables.
Allergenicity has also been raised as a possible issue.
Daffodil is responsible for an allergic reaction, which manifest as "daffodil pickers' rash" in some people.
Conclusion While many doubt the ability of golden grain to eliminate vitamin A deficiency, we need more answers to the question raised by anti-GM activists; we need to ensure the grain is freely available and acceptable to the poor.
Golden rice is not produced to supply all the vitamin A we need for a day.
It is meant to supplement, which only means that we should have other sources of vitamin A in our diet to meet the daily requirement.
You cannot expect people to eat rice alone so this should never be considered as a substitute.
A Spread of the Peanut Butter Industry (1)
Ronald Mark G. Omaña Researcher Center for Food and Agri Business, UA&P
At the thought of the word peanut, one would not miss mentioning the legume's most popular use - as peanut butter!
Peanut butter is one of the many products that fall under the bread spreads category.
(Other well-known spreads include butter, cheese spreads, jams, jellies and marmalades, sandwich spread, and mayonnaise).
Like the other spreads, peanut butter is normally added to ordinary bread to give it a distinct and specific flavor.
At times, it is used in baking, and also in cooking to create savory sauces for various vegetable, meat, and pasta dishes.
Peanut butter is made from roasted, peeled, and ground peanuts mixed with sugar, salt and oil.
HISTORY The origin of peanut butter can be traced back in 1890 when American physician George A. Bayle, Jr. experimented by grinding peanuts to produce ground nut paste, intended as a nutritional protein substitute for people with poor teeth (PeanutButterLovers.com). Since then, peanut butter has been used in the United States but it was only in 1904 when it was introduced to the world market.
According to the US National Peanut Board, peanut butter had its first world exposure at the Universal Exposition in St. Louis through C.H. Summer.
The product received tremendous consumer patronage, raking in US$ 705 in sales signaling the spread's very bright potential.
In the United States, peanut butter is part of the staple breakfast food.
Statistics say that 89% of the entire US' households consume the spread.
Moreover, about one-third of the country's peanut harvest is utilized for peanut butter manufacturing!
Even the world's largest producer of peanut butter is located in the US - Procter & Gamble, maker of the Jif brand.
The company can churn out 250,000 jars every day (NationalPeanutBoard.com). In the Philippines, the largest manufacturer of peanut butter is Unilever Bestfoods (formerly California Mfg.
PLAYERS Although not a staple part of the typical Filipino breakfast meal, the popularity of peanut butter has not missed the Philippines.
(Lily's), and Samuya Food Manufacturing Inc.
(Ludy's, Yummy, and Sunny Cheers).
Other smaller players include San Felipe Food Products (Queen Bee), and Barrio Fiesta Manufacturing Corp. (Barrio Fiesta).
Unbranded peanut butter, meanwhile, is also sold in wet markets and small bakeries and bread houses.
There are also a number of foreign peanut butter brands in the market like Skippy, McKester's, and Peter Pan.

The company is also a subsidiary of Bestfoods Asia Ltd. until Unilever Plc. bought Bestfoods in 2000.
In the peanut butter segment, the company controls an estimated market share of 60%.
Aside from peanut butter, Unilever also produces bread fills like jams, jellies, sandwich spread, cheese spread, and mayonnaise - also using the Lady's Choice and Bestfoods brands.
According to a company source, sales from bread spreads contribute a huge percentage to overall revenues.
Estimated Market Shares for Peanut Butter, 2000 Other Unilever Bestfoods products are Knorr food seasonings and soups, Royal pasta and noodles, Mazola corn oil, Alsa gelatins, Karo syrup, Lipton Ice Tea, Lady's Choice Banana-Tomato Catsup blend.
The company is already the third owner of the Lily's brand, which was established in the 1950s.
Established in 1971, Samuya Food Mfg.
Inc. produces peanut butter under the Ludy's, Yummy and Sunny Cheers brands.
The company's founder Mr. Gonzalo Tianzon, was a former employee of another peanut butter manufacturer, Newborn Food Products Inc.
Ludy's targets the broad C market and is made with high quality peanuts while Yummy makes use of lower grade peanuts and targets the D market.
The company's brands, along with Newborn Food Products' Lily's shares about 25% of the peanut butter market.
Samuya has its own marketing unit - Rodzon Marketing Corporation - to distribute its products.
Apart from peanut butter, Samuya also manufactures the Ludy's coco jam and ginger juice.
TRADE The Philippines is both an importer and exporter of peanut butter.
Over the last five years, however, imports have outweighed exports.
Imports.
Peanut butter imports were erratic.
From a peak of almost 1,000 tons (US$1.9 million) in 1997, imports fell by nearly 70% in 1998 to 301 tons (US$637,100) before expanding by 70% to 517 tons (US$762,300) in 1999.
Volume fell again in 2000 to 310 tons (US$ 377,700) and increased by 60% in 2001 to 496 tons (US$481,000).
Peanut Butter, Philippine Trade, 1997-2001
IMPORTS EXPORTS
National Statistics Office (NSO) Over the last five years, total imports reached 2,600 tons worth US$4.2 million.
Major sources were the United States, (64% of volume), followed by China (20%), Indonesia (7%), and Canada (6%).
The United States was the leading supplier of peanut butter to the Philippines with volume reaching almost 2,000 tons worth US$3.5 million.
Philippine Peanut Butter Imports, 1997 to 2001  Source:
NSO Exports.
From 1997 to 2001, the country has exported a total of 244 tons of peanut butter worth US$665,500.
In 2001, volume declined by 85% to 21 tons after expanding by more than three times to 142 tons in 2000 from only 42 tons in 1999.
Value of shipments overseas also dropped by 8% to US$65,700 from US$71,600 in 1997.
It was also lower by 78% compared to the value in 2000 of US$294,400.
The leading country buyers in 2001 were the United States (41% of volume), followed by Italy (21%), Australia and Japan (8% each), and Kuwait (4%).
The consistent leading buyer during the five-year period was also the United States with purchases totaling US$296,000 - about seven times bigger the value purchased by Italy for the same period.
Currently, a substantial percentage of total peanuts used are imported (usually from China) because they are cheaper and have relatively low moisture content.
According to a major player, his company uses 50% locally produced peanuts while the remaining 50% is imported.
Local peanuts, albeit tastier and with better aroma, cannot be completely relied on because of their high moisture content.
Players are critical about the moisture content of peanuts because a high moisture level will cause molds to develop allowing the growth of a carcinogenic substance called aflatoxin.
Sources say the entire spreads industry also suffers from slow movement in supermarkets and groceries.
This makes the peanut butter industry specifically more vulnerable to the new and more affordable spreads that have entered the market.
With this and the changing breakfast food patterns from bread with spreads to the more convenient and varied instant "no-cook" noodles, porridges, biscuits, and cookies, peanut butter stands to lose its hold on its market.
PROSPECTS The market for peanut butter has remained relatively steady in the past years.
The entry of breakfast substitutes like instant noodles, however, have led companies to be more creative.
Players have learned to address consumer demand and preference for more nutritious and healthier foods by fortifying their products with Vitamins A, B1, D3, and E. Another is the introduction of peanut butter with stripes of chocolate and fruit jams like guava and grape, notably from Unilever Bestfoods.
And since bread and spreads go hand-in-hand, another hope for the peanut butter industry is the expected growth the bread industry will post in the medium term.
Packaging is also a potential growth consideration.
Store checks revealed that peanut butter substitutes like sandwich spreads, mayonnaise, and cheese spreads have been enjoying tremendous sales after manufacturers, particularly Unilever Bestfoods and Kraft, introduced these in smaller retail packs at a cheaper cost.
Reports say Unilever is positioning its marketing strategy towards the mass market.
This strategy clicked with its shampoos in sachets and is expected to enjoy the same success in its mayonnaise, sandwich spread, and the recently launched Bestfoods Say Cheez cheese spread in sachets.
It would not be a bad idea if peanut butter producers adopt a similar scheme and experiment by introducing peanut butter in sachets.
Currently, the smallest peanut butter available is in 150-gram containers.
Institutional users could also be tapped to widen the spread's market.
Jams, jellies, and marmalades have been successful in this part.
A leading player revealed that part of his company's growth plans is tapping toll-packers and entering into private labeling agreements with supermarkets and food stores.
What the industry needs is to maintain producing high quality peanut butter coupled with a little marketing push.
The development of more varieties and a touch of advertising could definitely help it compete with more popular spreads.

The Growing Industry of Private Labels (1)
Ronald Mark G. Omaña Researcher Center for Food and Agri Business, UA&P
A visit to a major supermarket chain would show private label products alongside well-known brands.
The goods are usually offered at lower prices and consumers cannot help but take a second look.
WHAT ARE PRIVATE LABEL PRODUCTS?
Private label products, also known as in-house or store brands, are products that carry a store's name as its brand or another name owned by the store.
They usually cover food and non-food categories.
The labels are simple, usually two-colored, and the selling prices are relatively lower.
Private labels often occupy huge and prominent spaces inside supermarkets.
BEGINNINGS In the Philippines, the pioneer and the leader in retailing private label products is Supervalue Inc., operator of the SM Supermarket chain.
Supervalue uses the SM Bonus brand.
In other countries like the United States, private labels started at about the turn of the century.
Its popularity, however, dwindled when national brands, i.e., goods that are sold in almost all stores, utilized advertising to promote their products.
During the early 1970s, private labels clicked as consumers preferred cheaper products.
They were known then as "generics," i.e., low quality products packaged in minimalist wrappings (Fiery Foods & Barbeque Business Magazine).
The 1980s saw a renewed interest in national brands but this time, private label product retailers responded by improving on quality.
A few even made the extra step of offering "premium" private labels to compete with national brands, quality- and price-wise, owing to zero advertising expense.
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimated that in 2000, one of every five products bought in supermarkets in the US is a store brand.
Further, a recent report by the Private Label Manufacturers Association based on a survey made by Gallup Organization revealed that there is a high consumer acceptance of store brands.
Compared to previous surveys, more consumers are buying store brands and the frequency of purchase has also increased.
In Europe, while there are no available information on how private labels started, these products enjoy a relatively high acceptance rate among consumers.
A survey conducted by AC Nielsen in 1999 revealed that in the United Kingdom, 44.7% of total retail market is composed of private label product sales by volume.
In Belgium, the share is 34.8%, followed by Germany (33.5%), the Netherlands (21.1%), and France (22.2%).
On top of the list of the most saleable products were pasta, poultry and fruits and vegetables.
PRIVATE LABEL RETAILERS The big supermarkets in the country offer their own private labels.
These include Supervalue Inc., Rustan Supermarkets, Robinsons Supermarket, Uniwide Warehouse Club Inc., Ever Gotesco Supermarkets, and Pilipinas Makro Inc.'s chain of hypermarts.
Supervalue Inc., the operator of SM Supermarket, uses the SM Bonus brand for its private label products.
The company is the supermarket arm of retail magnate Henry Sy, owner of the SM chain of malls.
Its first supermarket was opened in the 1980s and its private label line was introduced practically during the same time.
Currently, Supervalue Inc. has a total of 11 supermarkets nationwide.
SM Bonus is the leading private label in the country today.
No other store brand has matched the number of products the label covers, be it in food or non-food.
At the time of its introduction, it had around 100 items with nearly half allocated to food.
Today, SM Bonus carries more than 1,500 items, about 30% of which are food products.
Among the food items, the most saleable are canned goods.
Rustan Supermarkets is owned by the Tantoco Family which also owns Rustan's Department Stores and a host of other food and non-food retailing companies such as Shopwise (hypermart), Marks & Spencer's and Starbucks Coffee (both local franchises).
At present, Rustan has seven branches and 14 smaller outlets (Rustans Expresslane).
Rustans uses the Sure Buy brand as its private label.
This brand covers a lesser number of products numbering below one hundred.
Food products account for about 90% of the total Sure Buy product line.
Robinsons Supermarket Corporation is one of the leading supermarket chains in the country.
It is owned by the Gokongwei Family which controls JG Summit Holdings Inc.
The company has 12 stores nationwide, 11 of which are housed inside Robinsons Malls.
Its store brand is called Supersavers.
The brand, however, covers only a limited line of products including food products such as sugar, soy sauce, vinegar, noodles, cooking oil, fresh chicken.
Uniwide Holdings Inc., the operator of Uniwide Sales Warehouse Club Inc., has 10 outlets located mainly in Metro Manila.
Its store brand is called the President's Preference.
This brand covers a minor line of food products such as refined sugar and coco gel.
Ever Gotesco Supermarkets has the Ever Savers brand for its private label.
Ever Savers covers basic food and non-food commodities although majority are non-food.
The food product offerings include refined sugar, cooking oil and frozen processed meats.
The Go family-owned company has five existing branches, three are located in its malls while the remaining two are stand alone.
Pilipinas Makro Inc. is the operator of the Makro hypermart chain.
Makro is a subsidiary of SHV Holdings Inc. of the Netherlands in partnership with SM Investments Inc. and Ayala Land Inc.
It is the newest retailer to offer store brands.
It first opened store in 1995.
It currently has nine outlets, five in Metro Manila, and one each in Cebu, Davao, Batangas, and Pampanga.
Makro's own brand is called aro.
Most of the commodities under this label are food products.
John Stanley, "Brands versus Private Labels" (www.about.com)
PRICE:
THE MAIN SELLING POINT A price survey conducted in three supermarkets revealed that private labels are indeed cheaper compared to national brands.
In Robinsons Supermarket, the Supersavers Chinese soy sauce (350 mL), is cheaper by P0.25 compared to its closest competition Datu Puti.
Comparative retail prices of selected private label products (in pesos) SM SUPERMARKET Pure coconut edible oil Vegetable oil (In tin can) 1.6 kg (In plastic bottle) 1.6 kg SM Bonus 62.50 SM Bonus 59.75 Baguio Oil 67.05 Cook Best 65.50 Minola 67.25 Marca Leon 66.75

Supermarket survey For the budget conscious consumer, these price differences matter, especially amid the hard economic times.
However, while retail prices play an important role in consumer decision making, the quality and taste of private labels will still be a significant deciding factor in patronizing these products.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION According to a retailer, aside from permits from the Department of Trade and Industry, the government through the Department of Health's Bureau of Food and Drugs, requires them to secure a permit to sell food products under their own labels.
This is on top of the license given to food manufacturers that are tapped to supply the food items to assure the consumers that the products are of high quality and are safe for human consumption.
PROSPECTS In the United States and Europe, the industry of private label products is very much advanced compared to the Philippines.
US supermarkets are extending to perishables, dairy, meats, produce, bakery, convenience food and home meal replacement menus.
The USDA expects the following categories to be occupied by private label products: functional foods (dairy, breakfast food, soft drinks, pet food), organic and natural foods, convenience foods, full-fat, full flavored foods, and dietary supplements.
In Europe, premium items are also being used as avenues of private label product expansions such as organic foods, chilled meals including ethnic meals, meat and fish dishes, herbs, sauces and other ingredients that are packaged with the meals, salads, and healthy and functional foods.
In the Philippines, there are also a lot of opportunities.
According to a local retailer, the future of private label products looks promising.
More and more items are expected to be included to the growing list of food and non-food commodities under store brands.
While the SM Bonus brand is way ahead of the pack given the sizeable line of items it covers, this still creates opportunity for others to follow.
The other private label retailers can still catch up and expand the coverage of their own brands.
The main selling point of private labels is usually their price.
Amid the economic difficulties, there is obviously a growing opportunity given the poverty incidence of nearly 40% in 2000 out of the country's population of 76.5 million.
As an industry source explained, these kinds of items are aimed at attracting the masses or the masa.
Also, opportunities abound especially in food products since more than half of the Filipino families' income is spent on food alone.
Based on the 2000 Family Income and Expenditure Survey of the National Statistics Office, total expenditure on food was 26% higher at P786 billion compared to P624 billion in 1997.
This comprises nearly 50% of the total family expenditure of P1.8 trillion in 2000.
With rising prices and declining consumer purchasing power, the fate of private label products will rely heavily on its ability to follow the name of the game, that is, to provide products that are affordable and high quality.
After all, giving consumers value for their money is no losing proposition.

Rooting For Potato (1)
Rosalie B. Bernardino Researcher Center for Food and Agri Business University of Asia and the Pacific
Potatoes are tuber vegetables that originated in South America.
They are one of the most nutritious foods in the world, containing high amounts of carbohydrates, potassium, iron, protein, fiber, phosphorous, and vitamins B1, B6 and C. Based on a 100-gram weight, potatoes are low in calories at 77 as compared to rice and pasta with 138 and 129, respectively.
They are also low in fat and contain more potassium than a banana and more iron than any other vegetable.
Performance Production.
Production during 1996-2000 declined by an average of 6% yearly as area planted contracted by 4% per annum.
A sharp decline was registered in 1998 as area planted slipped by 1,500 hectares.
In 2000, production reached 63,520 tons.
The bulk came from Benguet (67%), Davao Sur (14%), and Bukidnon (10%).
The average yield was less than 13 tons per hectare, rather low by global benchmark.
Bureau of Agricultural Statistics For the past five years, 70% of the total potato supply has been utilized for food, 25% for processing, and the rest for seeds, feeds and wastes.
Per capita consumption was barely one kilo per year.
Trade.
The country is a net importer of potatoes.
Imports grew by almost 18% annually from 25,359 tons ($25.5 million) in 1996 to 47,053 tons ($33.8 million) in 2000.
Much of the growth came from imports of prepared/preserved potatoes, which significantly grew from only 36 tons ($112,000) in 1996 to 29,587 tons ($19.8 million) in 2000.
Imports in 2000 consisted mainly of prepared/preserved (63%), starch (11%), and frozen (11%).
Major sources by quantity were the USA at 66% and Canada at 11%.
For the first six months of 2001, imports already reached 22,978 tons ($15.8 million).
By contrast, exports are relatively small and fluctuating, ranging from a low of 8 tons ($36,000) in 1996 to 482 tons ($1.2 million) in 1998.
Exports totaled 407 tons in 2000, with Singapore and Korea as the major destinations at 53% and 37% by volume, respectively.
For the first half of 2001, exports stood at 76 tons ($114,000).

VALUE (in $'000 - FOB for exports; CIF for imports)
Demand.
Potatoes have a variety of uses:
Fresh. Used as ingredient in viands, soups, salads and bakery products.
They can also be mashed, hashed, minced, boiled or roasted.
Processed.
They are made into chips, flakes and french fries, or starch for use by textile, soap and paste companies.
Other products derived from potatoes are sugar, for pharmaceutical preparations; and vinegar, alcohol, and wine for beverages.
Processed potato can be a profitable business venture.
Potato-based snackfood manufacturers and fastfood chains grew at about 15-17% and 15-20% per annum, respectively, from 1993-1998.
Snackfood.
The snackfood industry has a huge market - 60% of the population or those who are 30 years old or younger.
According to industry sources, there is a 15%- 20% recovery rate when fresh potatoes are processed into chips, or one kilo of chips for every 5 to 6.5 kilos of potatoes.
In 1998, the chips industry consumed about 50,000 to 70,000 cases per month or about 700-800 tons per month of fresh potatoes.
This would produce 1,260 tons-1,920 tons of potato chips per year.
Industry sources said that given an adequate supply of potatoes, a manufacturer can expand operations from 20 tons-80 tons a day.
However, there are some players who just import ready-to-eat chips and repack them for the local market.
The biggest player in the snackfood industry is Universal Robina Corporation, with an estimated market share of 51% in 1999.
There are 34 importers of potato snacks or ready-to-eat potato products in 1998 (National Statistics Office -NSO).
The key importers are Alliance Global Group, Benby Enterprises, Inc. and Rustan's Marketing Corp. Table 3.

Alliance Global Group, Inc.
Lay's Rustan's Marketing Corp. Pringles Source:
UA&P-Center for Food and Agri Business Databank Fastfood and Restaurants.
Demand for french fries continues to increase as the fastfood industry grows.
French fries consumption of fastfood chains, however, varies per branch depending on location, seating capacity, store hours, etc.
Consumer preferences also play an important part like size of servings, saltiness, and crispiness.
Some fastfood chains can consume an average of only 20 to 25 kilos of french fries per day per branch.
Others have a weekly average consumption of 35 cases (1 case = 13.64 kilos) or approximately 70 kilos per day.
A key player in the restaurant industry indicated that their fresh potato consumption averaged about 2 tons per month per branch.
Impediments to Growth There is a large market for potatoes.
Local production, however, cannot meet the required volumes and quality of potatoes especially for processing.
Constraints to growth include: limited supply of quality planting materials, low quality of potatoes (content and size), lack of technical know-how of farmers, inadequate infrastructure and other farm support services, and limited credit access.
Prospects With the growth in "eating out" (e.g. fastfood and restaurants), demand for fresh and processed potatoes will continue to increase.
Industry sources indicate that demand for potato chips alone is projected to increase by 10% annually in the next five years.
Fastfood and snackfood manufacturers will continue to rely on imports until there are significant improvements in the production and quality of locally produced potatoes.
Research should be directed at developing or finding varieties that are not only suitable to local conditions but also satisfy requirements for processing.
The Mindanao Agricultural Research Center has been experimenting on local seed propagation.
If successful, this would help reduce dependence on imported seeds.

Ice cream, a flavored frozen food, is made up of milkfat or butterfat, milk solids, sweeteners, stabilizers and emulsifiers and water.
There are also unusual flavors such as mashed potato and bacon, tuna fish, fried pork rind, chili con carne, garlic, sauerkraut, horseradish and beer, mustard, dill pickle, and ketchup.
One story says that Marco Polo brought a product resembling sherbet from China.
In 1670, the masses were able to taste the "iced cream" and it eventually became famous in the 1700's.
In 1846, Nancy Johnson invented the first hand-crank ice cream freezer.
Today, ice cream, with all its flavors and variations, has evolved into one of the world's most popular desserts.
According to an industry source, bulk ice cream used to dominate the market with 70% share, while the rest are frozen novelties.
Today, the share has been reversed to 30% and 70%, in favor of frozen novelties.
Based on the National Statistics Office - Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES), ice cream spending reached P2.3 billion in 1997.
The National Capital Region (NCR) dominated spending with 41% share (P909 million), followed by Southern Tagalog, 13% (P285 million), and Central Luzon, 10% (P225 million).
On the other hand, Le Mars, Iowa was named Ice Cream Capital of the World by the Iowa legislature.
Le Mars is the place where Blue Bunny, a popular ice cream brand, is manufactured.
The world's leading producers of ice cream and related desserts are the United States and China at 61.3 million hecto liters (mhl) and 23.6 mhl, respectively (Table 1).
(M hecto liters)
(per capita, in liters)
Dairy Science and Technology, University of Guelph Meanwhile, per capita consumption is highest in New Zealand at 26.3 liters, followed by United States, 22.5 liters; Canada and Australia, both at 17.8 liters; Switzerland, 5.5 liters; and Sweden at 14.2 liters.
On the other hand, the Philippines has less than 1 liter per capita consumption for ice cream.
Key Players The Philippine market is dominated by three companies, namely:
Selecta-Wall's, Inc.
(Selecta), Nestle Philippines, Inc.
(Nestle Magnolia) and Universal Robina Corp. (Presto-Tivoli) (Table 2).
Selecta and Nestle each claim market shares of 46%.
The rest are accounted for by smaller players like URC and Arcefoods, Inc.
Major Industry Players Company Brands Selecta-Walls, Inc.
Selecta Cornetto Nestle Philippines, Inc.
Magnolia Nestle Baby Ruth, Crunch, Drumstick, Frizzy, Kimy, Lick Stick, Mega, Milo, Nestle, Non-Stop, Turbo Zoom Universal Robina Corp. Presto Tivoli Swiss Miss There are also imported brands in the market such as Dairy Queen, Haagen Dazs, Dreyers Ice Cream, Dippin Dots and Baskin and Robbins.
Constraints and Prospects Ice cream consists mainly of dairy.
Since the country imports 99% of its dairy supply, the ice cream industry is vulnerable to foreign exchange fluctuations.
Another concern is the presence of adequate storage and handling facilities since ice cream easily melts.
The product's shelf-life usually ranges from two weeks to one year depending on the conditions of its storage (Dairy Science and Technology, University of Guelph, Canada).
Consumption is largely influenced by quality, such as flavor, body and texture, appearance or color of the product, and packaging.
Mishandling of the product from the sellers to the consumers leads to quality deterioration.
Shelf-stability of the ice cream is a must.
Increasing competition in the market has also led manufacturers to develop and launch new production techniques, flavors and products.
Overall, there is still a large market for ice cream.
In the Philippines, where ice cream is considered as a traditional dessert, there is definitely room for increasing the low per capita consumption.
The key is in providing quality products at competitive prices and putting more money into people's pockets.
As the industry gets better and better...people will definitely scream for more!

Sizing up the Fruit Spreads Market (1)
Ana Cecilia S. Palma Researcher Center for Food and Agri Business UA&P
When change comes to a country, its ripples may be felt for generations.
Consider the processed fruit industry, which was, for many years, a top export winner.
That picture significantly changed with the Asian financial crisis in 1997.
The industry was greatly affected by the depreciation of the peso and other economic and political factors.
However, it is still among the country's main exports and a good source of the much-needed dollar earnings.
The Philippines, a tropical country, boasts of fruits that are abundant during peak months.
This situation makes it conducive to processing or preserving fruits due to its low prices.
Once processed, fruits are made available even during off-season especially in areas where supply may be limited or where the fruits are not available at all.
The processed fruit industry can be divided into three categories: preserved or prepared fruits, fruit juices, purees and concentrates, and dried or dehydrated fruits.
Preserved or prepared fruits are used in salads or served as deserts or even act as bread fills or what is not popularly known as fruit spreads.
Fruit juices, purees and concentrates are fruit beverages and sometimes categorized under the non-alcoholic beverages industry.
Meanwhile dried or dehydrated fruits are used as an ingredient in muesli, breakfast cereals and mixed-fruit snacks.
This document, however, will focus on fruit spreads.
Fruit Spreads Fruit spreads are bread fills that are fruit-based.
They include jams, marmalades and jellies.
They are commonly used with the pan de sal or loaf bread.
Table 1.
Fruit Spreads:
Butters are not gelled.
SOURCE: http://ohioline.osu.edu
Production With limited data available, the total production of fruit spreads is difficult to ascertain.
However, one fruit spread manufacturer cited the average production capacity for jams and marmalades is around 60,000 cases a month, with a capacity utilization of about 70%.
Normally, the plant operates six days a week but can easily adjust production schedules if there is a demand hike, especially during holiday season.
While fruit production is located in the rural areas, most processing plants are concentrated in Metro Manila particularly for fruit spreads.
Trade The country imports and exports jams, marmalades and jellies.
Exports.
The bulk of fruit spreads exports were jams and marmalades, accounting for 97% of export value in 2000.
Fruit Spreads Exports, 1996 to 2001* Year Jams & marmalades Jellies, citrus fruits Jellies, other than citrus fruits
It posted a negative growth of 24% yearly over the period.
The fall in exports was largely due to the erratic buying of Japan in the past five years.
In 1996, more than sixty percent of the country's jams and marmalades exports went to Japan.
However, in 1998, the Japanese market began to soften--acquiring only 20% ($0.25M) of total Philippine exports.
Then in 1999, Japan accounted for only one percent ($15,000) of total exports.
By 2000, it began to pick up again.
The largest markets in 2000 were United States (42% of total export value), Japan (17%), Hong Kong (10%), Canada (10%) and Saudi Arabia (4%).
Jellies.
The country trades two kinds of jellies: (a) jellies, citrus fruit, cooked whether or not containing added sugar or sweetening; and (b) jellies, other than citrus fruit, being cooked preparations, whether or not containing added sugar.
Total exports amounted to $30,000 in 2000, supplying the Japanese, American and Taiwanese markets.
The country imported an average of $600,000 worth of fruit spreads in the past five years, though there was a notable increase in 1999.
Imports of jellies other than citrus fruits jumped to $1.2M in 1999 from only $0.3M in 1998 while citrus jelly imports swelled to $23,000 in 1999 from only $1,050 in 1998.
In 2000, importation softened.
From 1996 to 2000, total value of imports posted an average growth of 29%.
Fruit Spreads Imports, 1996 to 2001* Year Jams & marmalades Jellies, citrus fruits Jellies, other than citrus fruits
National Statistics Office-Foreign Trade Statistics (NSO-FTS) Jams and marmalades.
Imports fluctuated in the last five years.
Average annual growth, in terms of value, was at negative 3.3%.
Imports reached $0.5M in 1997 but nose-dived in 2000 to only $0.1M, a 61% drop from the year before.
The US market supplied 27% of total imports value in 2000, a big contrast to 1999's 70%.
Other major suppliers include Taiwan (22%), Spain (17%), Singapore (17%) and United Kingdom (5%).
Imports registered positive growth in the past five years.
There was a notable hike in 1999 when import values jumped by more than 2,000 percent for citrus fruit jellies and a 100 percent gain for jellies other than citrus fruit.
The surge in imports was attributed to the expansion of the institutional market in 1999.
China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the United States were the main sources of jellies.
These four countries supplied 96% of total import value in 2000.
Key Players There are approximately 150 companies engaged in the manufacture and export of processed fruits, according to the 1994 Survey of Establishments (National Statistics Office).
The major firms involved in the production and distribution of fruit spreads include California Manufacturing Co.
(CMC) and Sysu International.
Major Players in the fruits spreads market Company Brand California Manufacturing Co.
(Hong Kong), which was recently acquired by Unilever worldwide.
CMC in the Philippines was established in 1955 as a 50-50 percent venture between CPC International and Ajinomoto Japan.
They manufacture a wide variety of products--from seasoning to hot cake syrup.
The more popular brands are Knorr, Bestfoods, Lady's Choice, Royal Pasta, Alsa and Karo syrup.
CMC Product Lines Products Brand Seasonings, Soup Knorr Pasta noodles Royal Salad aids, spreads, preserves Lady's Choice Corn oil Mazola Gelatins Alsa Syrup Karo SOURCE:
CFA Databank The company has three processing plants in Luzon.
The pickles and Knorr brand liquid seasoning are manufactured in Parañaque City; pasta noodles, soups, preserves, corn oil, and syrup in Las Piñas; and salad aids and dressings in Cavite City.
In the bread fill category, particularly peanut butter, CMC's Lady's Choice products are considered the market leader.
Their peanut butter production accounts for around 60% of the company's bread fill production while the remaining 40% are jams, jellies and marmalades.
The company's main business is distribution of imported products.
Its major products are Hershey's chocolates, Kikkoman soy sauce, San Remo pasta, Lee Kum Kee seasonings and Clara Ole jams, jellies and marmalades.
The company manufactures jams in its Novaliches plant.
The production of Clara Ole, though, was stopped for two years in the early 1980s because there was no brand manager to handle it.
However, the company brought it back because it could still generate revenues in the existing market.
Clara Ole, though, is considered a small brand because of the very limited market.
Government Policies Food processors are required to comply with the regulations set by the Department of Health - Bureau of Food and Drugs (DOH-BFAD).
All unregistered imported food products sold or offered for sale may be confiscated by BFAD.
Product registration is aimed at preventing misbranding and adulteration.
Imported products may also be labeled with the name and address of the importer or they may be subject to confiscation.
Stickering is currently permitted.
Each Philippine importer of a product should make application for registration directly to BFAD.
Registrations can be renewed for a minimal cost for either one or five years.
Processed commodities for export also have to adhere with international standards as specified by the Food and Agriculture Organization-Codex Alimentarius Commission.
The effective tariff rate for jams, marmalades and jellies range from 3 to 15% in 2001.
Key Concerns A major concern of the fruit spreads industry is the inconsistent supply of raw materials.
The seasonality of fruit production prevents the industry from boosting its capacity as the production schedule is more often than not dictated by the fruits in season.
Poor roads and high freight costs also hinder the movement of raw materials from source to processing plants.
Other constraints include the high prices of major raw materials like sugar, packaging and preservatives.
Meanwhile, fruit spreads are also not very popular with the children because of the other bread fills available in the market.
Instead of purchasing fruit spreads, mothers either buy bread with fillings or bread with peanut butter or liver spread, which are a lot cheaper than fruit spreads.
Aside from the competition within the same category, fruits spreads are also outdone by the other substitute goods like biscuits, cookies, instant noodles, rice porridge, etc.
In the supermarkets, fruit spreads occupy only a minor portion of the shelf because of slow movement.
Another hitch is the constant changes in regulations and market conditions in other countries that put the industry in a disadvantage.
The fluctuations in trade may be brought about by changing conditions in the international market.
Prospects According to industry players, the fruit spreads industry registered steady growth in the last few years.
Unfortunately, they sense a high probability of the market going down.
Recently, sales have not been doing well.
In supermarkets, fruit spreads are not given good positioning because of slow movement.
Considering also that not many people consume breakfast at home because of the changing demands of their working environment, the over-all bread fill category does not have new markets.
The industry is simply trying to maintain its existing market.
Further, it is more expensive to eat bread during breakfast than instant noodles and porridges.
This is why the 'substitutes' like biscuits, instant noodles and instant porridges are rapidly eating a bigger slice of the breakfast market.
Aside from the price advantage, 'substitutes' are also more convenient because they are ready to eat.
However, the institutional market is an area that manufacturers can explore more.
In 1999, there was an expansion in imported jellies attributed to the increased demand by the institutional market.
There is also a need to have some product development and promotion to increase demand and consumer awareness of fruit spreads.
All in all, the market is bearish but manufacturers have high hopes for the industry.
Fruits spreads are becoming less popular as replaced by the more convenient products and more affordable ones.
However, there are still some untapped markets as logistics improve.
There is always room also, for new products in totally new markets, with the proper technology and government support.
Hopefully, with joint efforts by the private sector and the government, the fruit spreads market in the country will expand and become more popular.
Such a sweet thing to waste!

Keeping Its Sweet Disposition (1)
Ana Cecilia S. Palma Researcher Center for Food and Agri Business University of Asia and the Pacific
The confectionery industry can be divided into three categories: chocolate, sugar confectionery, and chewing gum.
Sugar confectionery includes fruits, drained and glazed or crystallized candies, nut mixed with sugar and honey.
Candies are categorized as hard or soft.
Hard candies include butterballs, lemon drops and the like while soft candies consist of orange, jelly, marshmallow, among others.
Chocolate is a much younger product than sugar confectionery.
The very first chocolate house opened in London in 1657.
Chocolates are made from ground roasted cocoa beans, and one of the most popular foods in the world.
Meanwhile, chewing gums are sweetened and flavored insoluble plastic materials (as a preparation of chicle1 ) used for chewing.
This article seeks to provide an overview of the industry with emphasis on sugar confectionery and chewing gum.
Performance Total household spending on chocolates and candies reached P3.01 billion (B) (National Statistics Office-Family Income and Expenditure Survey, 2000).
The purchases usually expand during special occasions like Christmas and Valentine's Day.
The National Capital Region is the leading consuming region, contributing 31% of household spending on chocolates and candies, followed by Southern Tagalog (15%) and Central Luzon (13%).
On the other hand, according to industry estimates, the retail market for whole confectionery industry (chocolate, candies, chewing gums, etc.) is worth P17B in 1999 and is projected to reach P20B by 2004.
On the average, volume growth was around 42% from 1995 to 2000, brought about by rapid urbanization and growth of young population.
Local producers supply about 65% of domestic demand.
Their products are priced relatively lower than imported confectionery products.
The latter, however, is slowly increasing its market share.
Sugar confectionery products dominate especially in the rural areas.
This is because candies are classified as impulse products in retail outlets such as grocery stores and supermarkets.
Imported candies are not as popular as imported chocolates.
Meanwhile, according to Sweetsexpo 2001, the demand for confectionery in the Pacific Rim has risen a little over 11% since 1993.
There was an estimated 900,000 tons of confectionery sold in the region in 1999.
The industry is rapidly expanding in this area and taking up a prominent fixture in the processed food category.

Trade Imports.
Shipments of sugar confectionery (soft and hard candies and chewing gum) fluctuated during 1996 to 2001, peaking at 11,870 tons in 2001 and lowest at 2,268 tons in 1998.
In 2001, the country imported US$1.2 million (M) worth of chewing gums and $13 M worth of hard and soft candies.
Imports of hard and soft candies generally increased over the period.
Shipments reached 10,300 tons in 2001 from 2,500 tons in 1996 with hard candies accounting for an average of 80% yearly.

National Statistics Office In 2001, Indonesia was the leading source of hard candies with a 43% share in terms of import value, followed by Thailand (29%).
Meanwhile, Thailand (39%) and China (23%) were the leading sources of chewing gum in 2001.
The country is an exporter of candies and chewing gum.
Candy exports inched up by an average of 14% annually from 1,200 tons in 1996 to 2,100 tons in 2001.
The leading buyers were Hong Kong (15% of export value) and Malaysia (13%) for hard candies and Canada (26%) and Hong Kong (19%) for soft candies.
Meanwhile, chewing gums grew by an average of 5% yearly to 5,000 tons in 2001 from 4,000 tons in 1996.
In 2001, the leading buyers of chewing gums were Vietnam (29% of export value) and Malaysia (20%).
Key Players There are big companies and multi nationals present in the local sugar confectionery industry.
The major players include Universal Robina Corporation, Storck Products, Inc. and Candyman.
These companies have long established their presence in the market.

Government Policies The local confectionery manufacturers adhere to the regulations set by the Bureau of Food and Drugs on food additives, contaminants, food hygiene and labeling.
Under food additives, standards are defined for the following parameters: alkalizing and neutralizing agents, emulsifiers, and flavors.
For contaminants, limits for arsenic, copper and lead contents are prescribed.
Tariffs on sugar confectionery (including chewing gum) not containing cocoa are pegged at 10% in 2002, 7% in 2003 and down to 5% in 2004.
Meanwhile, white chocolate is subject to import tariffs of 7% in 2002 and 5% in 2003 and 2004.
Incentives/Impediments to Growth Local candies and chewing gums are generally cheaper than imports in the domestic market.
There have been developments in terms of computer-aided design and manufacturing processes, including bar coding, thus, increasing the productivity of the industry.
Also, a study indicated that almost 70% of confectionery products are bought on impulse; this makes the products maintain one of the widest distribution bases of any consumer product.
It is available in the neighborhood sari-sari stores, convenience stores, grocery stores and huge supermarkets, not to mention street peddlers, selling candies to traveling consumers inside public transports.
Meanwhile, the impediments to growth include gaps in supporting and related services and high input costs, particularly sugar.
Imports have surged for confectionery products during 1996 to 2001.
The weak linkage of the two sectors hinders the industry's development.
Further, the influx and preference for imported confectionery are a challenge to the local industry.
Prospects How will the industry keep its sweet disposition?
One of the competitive edges of the local manufacturers is their ability to cater to the large low-income segment with low-priced retail packs.
The expanding and diverse product lines of candies and chewing gums, better distribution networks, increasing young population, and strong marketing are also key factors that will drive demand over the next few years.
However, growth could be moderate (4 to 5% annually2 ) in the next five years due to weak purchasing power.
Industry competition will continue to be intense.
New product innovations will include low fat products, sugarless sweets, and functional sugar confectionery (i.e. fortified with vitamins) as well as new brand introductions that can sell in the domestic and export markets.
In addition, manufacturers will seek to further widen the distribution networks to include the hotel, restaurant and institutional (HRI) sector, hardware shops and other high traffic places, where impulse buying opportunities can be present.
Meanwhile, the penetration of high quality imported confectionery products pose as a threat to the local industry.
The manufacturers should take a stronger role to assure the quality of their products and to keep prices at affordable levels.
They should improve on product quality through new investments in food manufacturing equipment, product and packaging innovations, enhancement of production efficiency through economies of scale and demonstrable value for money.

TECHNO FOODS, INC.:
SURVIVING IN AN INDUSTRY OF GIANTS
Ronald Mark G. Omña Researcher Center for Food and Agri Business UA&P
Spreads are used to spice-up and give specific flavor to bread.
It covers a wide range of products: mayonnaise, sandwich spread, fruit jams, marmalades and jellies, butter, peanut butter, and cheese spreads.
A close relative of the spreads is salad dressing.
A look into major supermarkets and groceries would reveal that this industry is dominated by multinational companies.
These include Unilever Bestfoods, Inc. formerly California Manufacturing Company, Inc.
(Lady's Choice and Bestfoods brands), Kraft Foods (Phils.), Inc.
(Kraft), and McCormick Foods Corp. (McCormick).
While these firms lord it over the spreads industry, a local company is trying to gain a niche in the lucrative market.
With his technical knowledge and understanding of the business, Mr. Tiu along with a partner invested P5 million and leased a 600 square meter facility within the government-owned Food Terminal Complex.
And Techno Foods Inc. was born.
Being a new entrant and a very small company, Techno Foods struggled during its first years.
"We have very limited resources and I am fighting multinational companies - Kraft Foods and Unilever Bestfoods, they are the giants and I am (just) a nobody," explained Mr. Tiu.
People he knew were even skeptical and told him his business would last for only six months.
Techno Foods' initial products included mayonnaise, salad dressing and sandwich spreads in consumer glass bottles (225 milliliters [mL] and 470 mL) and institutional plastic packaging (3.5 mL) using the Roger's brand.
Mayonnaise is an emulsion, which is a mixture of two liquids - oil and water - that normally cannot be combined.
An emulsifier like egg yolk is used to bind the ingredients and prevent them from separating.
Oil content in mayonnaise is set at a minimum of 65% of total weight.
Meanwhile, salad dressing is produced using a small amount of mayonnaise plus starch and gum thickeners.
Oil content is about 50% of total weight.
Sandwich spread, on the other hand, is salad dressing added with various spices and flavorings.
Mayonnaise, salad dressing and sandwich spread are stable products.
According to Mr. Tiu, the shelf life can range from 8 months to one year.
Production does not require refrigeration or call for any other special machinery.
In fact, Techno Foods uses locally fabricated equipment.
From an initial daily production of 50 to 60 4-gallon cases in 1993, Techno Foods now produces 450 to 500 4-gallon cases.
Despite the increase, Mr. Tiu explains that it is just half of the plant's total production capacity.
Sixty to sixty-five percent of production is devoted to the manufacture of mayonnaise, which is the company's top-selling product.
It also has distributors in other parts of the country.
Its products are also sold in small groceries and stores in Metro Manila.
The company has also private labeling agreements with Isetann Supermarket and the CLS Supermarket chain in Pangasinan.
Mr. Tiu proudly revealed that recently, he has closed a deal with Supervalue Inc., operator of the SM Supermarket chain to produce spreads for its SM Bonus brand.
Mr. Tiu boasts that his Roger's brand has already edged Kraft in Divisoria because of lower selling price and comparable product quality.
It is now competing with Bestfoods and Lady's Choice.
A price survey conducted in a grocery in Pasig confirmed that the Roger's brand is priced lower than the popular brands Kraft, Bestfoods, and Lady's Choice (Table 1).
On a per milliliter (ml) basis, Roger's mayonnaise was only 13 centavos compared to 16 centavos for Kraft and Bestfoods.
Lady's Choice mayonnaise was the most expensive at 19 centavos.
Data not available for McCormick.
Salad dressing, meanwhile, was 11 centavos/mL followed by Kraft (13 centavos/mL) and Bestfoods (14 centavos/mL).
CONCLUDING REMARKS Techno Foods' success in establishing prominent presence for its products in the Divisoria market did not come easy.
It encountered problems in procuring raw materials like eggs.
Some local suppliers required cash payments.
There were also difficulties in collecting payments from supermarkets and burger stands, which take more than four months.
According to Mr. Tiu, a small company like his cannot survive without cash.
Mr. Tiu believes that there is a bright future for his business.
He added that if there would be distributors willing to finance, Techno Foods would not hesitate to put their products on the shelves of major supermarket chains since his production plant has the capacity to supply a bigger demand.
In the next five years, Techno Foods targets more production for private labels.
Mr. Tiu considers quality and price as his advantage.
Costs are kept at the minimum since he and his partner personally attend to the daily operations of the company and the small production staff.
For this year, the company expects sales to decline by about 25% because of the decreased production due to low uptake and collection problems with supermarkets.
However, it hopes to bounce back in 2002.

An Analysis of Agriculture and Fisheries Growth in the Philippines,1990 - 2002(1)
Rolando T. Dy Executive Director Center for Food and Agri Business University of Asia and the Pacific This short paper will try to answer the question: what subsectors and industries contributed to agriculture growth in the decade in general, and in 2002 in particular.
It will delve into the many causes of underdevelopment of agriculture which are discussed in many fora.
Agri-based communities are host to most of the poor in the country.
Certainly, there is room for productivity improvement and farm diversification measures.

BENCHMARKING Agriculture grew at an average annual rate of about 2% during 1990-2000 (Table 2).
China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam did much better.
It is a dismal record which most people already know but our decision-makers are struggling to address.

GROWTH Amid the already poor performance, what were the drivers and downers?
Agriculture grew faster to 4.7% and 3.7% , respectively in 2001 and 2002.
The main drivers were fisheries, poultry and livestock.
Interestingly, these sectors were mostly demand-driven.
CONTRIBUTIONS TO GROWTH Where did the growth come from?
Which subsector contributed to the growth in the 1990s and early 2000s?
The analysis below shows the growth sources.
In 1990-2000, expansion was fuelled by the non-crop subsectors which together contributed about 86% of growth.
Poultry gave 36.8%, livestock 27.5% and fisheries 22%.
What were the leaders and the laggards of the crops subsector?
The leaders were: rice, mango, banana and sugarcane.
The laggards: corn, coffee, garlic, onion, tobacco and abaca.
In 2001 and 2002, non-crops remained the heaviest contributors.
The leaders in the crops were mango, rice, banana, sugarcane, and garlic.
STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS The overall agriculture portfolio is not doing well.
Poultry, livestock and fisheries had been consistent drivers of agriculture growth since 1990.
They were mostly demand-driven.
A key support would be access to competitively priced inputs.
Aquaculture needs more resource flow given its high potential for gains.
If growth in these subsectors are stymied, the whole agriculture growth will suffer and in turn, the total economy too.
It is claimed that:
• Public spending is not adequate.
The AFMA, which was passed in 1997, provides for an additional P20 billion (B) budget for agriculture on top of the regular DA budget in the first two years of implementation and P17B in the next five years.
The AFMA requirements were only partially met.
• Efficiency of public investments.
Money has mostly been spent on areas with low returns but are politically popular (e.g. rice).
• Management and delivery of support services have been hampered because of the Local Government Code, which devolved extension and delivery of agricultural services to the local government units.
The law has to be revisited.
We need to adopt the "seed-to-shelf" approach in order to enhance the competitiveness of agriculture.
Developing agriculture makes a lot of business sense.
Today, a large chunk of the rural sector are outside the marketing loop of consumer goods firms.
Consumers there could hardly afford packaged foods and non-food items.
Most homes can spare at most P2.50 to P5 per purchase.
With rising jobs and incomes, it will be a different story.

The Belittled Industry(1)
Marie Annette S. Galvez Agribusiness Specialist Center for Food and Agri Business  University of Asia and the Pacific The Philippine layer sector (chicken egg) has played a minor role in the poultry industry.
It is not proverbial like the broiler sector (chicken).
Although, the latter accounted for 75% of the poultry industry, the layer sector registered the highest growth of 13% between 2001 and 2002.
This is attributed to the increase in the number of chicken layers.
The layer sector is composed of small, medium and big farms.
In a span of four years, membership has extended to egg growers from key production areas with combined layer population of 15 million.
Moreover, it has organized two egg shows and has crafted a master plan, among others.
Boons and Bounties Based on Bureau of Agricultural Statistics' agriculture performance for 2002, the layer sector contributed about P17 billion at current prices or 3% to total value of agriculture in 2002.
Chicken eggs are one of the cheapest and excellent sources of protein.
Apart from being easy to prepare, eggs are a valuable source of iron, phosphorous, Vitamin B12 and other nutrients.
A detailed list of the contents of a 50-gram egg is shown in Table 1.

Australian Egg Industry Association Further, egg preparation is one of the most versatile.
It can be boiled, poached, scrambled or combined with other ingredients.
Egg products also come in various forms - refrigerated liquid, frozen, dried, specialty and consumer - which are for commercial, food service and home use.
Important Indicators Production.
Production and Growth Trends of Chicken Eggs, Philippines, 1998-2002 Note:
Aside from chicken eggs, the country imports products like egg powder, dried egg yolk and other than dried egg yolk.
From 1998 to 2002, volume of imported chicken eggs grew by 12% yearly.
Meanwhile, imports of egg powder, dried egg yolk and other than dried egg yolks increased by 22%, 140% and 19% p.a., respectively.
On the other hand, egg powder, dried egg yolk and other than dried egg yolk came mainly from USA, Belgium and Denmark, respectively.

Retail Price Trends of Chicken Eggs, Metro Manila, 1998-2002 Source:
A Challenging Task One of the biggest issues that beset the chicken egg industry is the low domestic consumption.
A cross country comparison cited in the layer master plan indicated that the Philippines has a per capita consumption that is similar with Indonesia of 51 eggs/year but far lower than Thailand of 130 eggs/year and China, 300 eggs/year.
Moreover, the Philippines ranked 20th among Asian countries in terms of per capita consumption.
The sector is threatened by the perception that chicken eggs cause high cholesterol levels.
This idea has thwarted the local demand of table eggs.
Also, it is believed that a maximum of only three eggs should be consumed every week.
On the contrary, recent research(5) discloses that an egg a day is beneficial.
The Egg Board regards the situation as a challenge.
It commits to work in order to double or triple egg consumption in the next few years.
With the help of the Department of Agriculture, the Egg Board has started its multi-media campaign by radio and TV commercials to educate consumers on the benefits of eggs and correcting the misconception.
The layer sector may have a long way to go but a unified effort of the egg growers shows a lot of promise.

Tap, Bottled, Refilled, and Delivered(1) (Philippines)
Senen U. Reyes Senior Management Specialist Center for Food and Agri Business  University of Asia and the Pacific Not too long ago, it was common especially in the rural areas to see a man fetch water from an open well or river and carry it to the house of a woman being wooed.
Fetching water was a sign of the love and service a man was willing to give to his beloved.
Being a natural resource, water was free and clean.
A Generic Natural Resource No More A lot has changed since then.
Water has become more and more a commodity than just a basic necessity.
From being a generic natural resource, water has been processed, packed, labeled, and branded.
Thus, water has become more expensive and more precious than ever with potable water becoming a scarce resource.
Purified for Commercial Use The business of purifying water started as early as the 1920s when bottled water was developed in the West.
The MWSS was later privatized into the Maynilad Water and Manila Water.
However it was probably only in the last 20 years when intensive campaigns were started to clean wastewater and provide safer drinking water.
The 1980s saw the proliferation of gadgets and equipment to purify water.
This was largely due to the inability of public water utilities to service a considerable part of urban areas much less the rural areas.
The deteriorating condition of water distribution lines also contributed to the popularity of water purifiers.
Water purifier brands such as Homemaster, Sanyo, Imarflex, Aquagard, and Tupuro entered the market.
Purification was done at home with the simple process of passing tap water through a filter element containing different layers like sand and activated carbon.
There are models which use ultraviolet light to kill harmful bacteria.
Currently, Waters Philippines with its Waters Bio Mineral Pot is the reputed leader in water purification products in the Philippines.
Another product currently in the market is Megafresh Mineral Water Pot and X Green Ceramic Water Filter from Korea.
The 1990s added to the sophistication of water purification technology with the introduction of bottled water from different processes and sources including imports.
Raw water is passed through a series of six to eight processes of filtration, adsorptive refinement, reverse osmosis, ultra violet irradiation, and ozonation to get the final product.
Wilkins is reputedly the number one bottled water brand and together with Viva and First comprises a considerable share of the market.
These three brands were formerly under La Tondeña which has been in the process of restructuring into a fully liquor-based company.

Wilkins is the most expensive local brand probably because of its reputation as suited for infant formulation even without boiling.
On the other hand, SM Bonus is the cheapest brand.
One brand, Nature's Spring, came up with a flavored water variant that costs P16.50 for a 600-ml bottle available in four flavors: apple, grape, honey dew, and lemon.
Bottled water is available in various sizes.

A Closer, Cheaper Source The advent of bottled water created another business phenomena in water refilling stations which dotted the country like the hot pan de sal, lechon manok, shawarma, and pearl shakes.
There is an estimated 3,000 water stores in the country, a good number of which are located inside villages and subdivisions.
The initial concept was for customers to come with their own containers and have it filled on a per gallon basis costing around P8.00 - 10.00.
However, the services of these refilling stations have extended to free delivery of 5-gallon containers with free use of a hot and cold dispenser provided a minimum weekly consumption is met.
Some stations also sell different types of dispensers and smaller sizes of bottled water.
The popularity of bottled water and refilling stations prompted the National Statistics Office to separate bottled water as another food category from other non-alcoholic beverages.

CFA databank and research Another development in the water industry is water delivery through mobile water tanks.
Under this scheme, 30 drum capacity tanks mounted on trucks deliver water for all-purpose use to homes and small business establishments.
Orders are taken by the drum (40 gal/drum) which cost P20-25 per drum in Baguio City and P30 per drum in Metro Manila.
Monthly expenditure for water can run from P1,900 up to P2,800 given an average household size of five members and average daily consumption of 100 liters per person.
Safe Water vs. Safe Environment In a 1995 book by Peter F. Drucker entitled "Managing in a Time of Great Change," he discusses that one of the new markets in the expanding world economy is the market for equipment to purify water and air.
He goes on by saying that in the United States, purification of water and effluents is proceeding apace.
He continues that municipal sewage is the worst offender when it comes to water pollution.
While Mr. Drucker clearly points to the purification of wastewater or sewage water, it is essential that it be purified before it eventually find its way to the sources of potable water.
The United States is the largest market for bottled water with annual consumption of 11.2 billion liters but Italians consume more per person at 138 liters closely trailed by the French.

Dr. Biksham Gijja, head of Freshwater Program of the World Wide Fund International, estimates that there are 1.5 million tons of plastics needed for the production of water bottles.
He warns that toxic chemicals are released during their manufacture and later on in their disposal.
This will contribute to environmental pollution and climate change.
Already, water bottles are left anywhere and these will likely end up in waterways and drainage systems.
Usually the regulation focuses on the finished product not on the source of raw material.
There are also a considerable number of households not serviced by public water utilities which built their own deep wells.
These drillings and water withdrawals if left unabated may lead to environmental problems.
Business is right in addressing an immediate basic need in providing safe purified drinking water.
But this must be done in an environment-friendly and sustainable manner.
Business must educate consumers on the proper disposal of the non-biodegradable containers and not draw from this scarce natural resource more than the replenishment rate.

Wheating the Filipino Appetite(1)
Senen U. Reyes Senior Management Specialist Center for Food and Agri Business  University of Asia and the Pacific Wheat, though not indigenously grown in the Philippines, has become one of the most consumed commodities in the country.
Products derived from wheat are almost staples although not as much as rice.
Consequently, it is the country's biggest agricultural import averaging $373 million a year.
In its processed form (flour), wheat is used as the main raw material in the manufacture of foods such as the everyday pan de sal, donuts, tasty bread, biscuits, cookies, cakes, other bakery products, noodles, pasta, pizza crust, pastries, fish crackers, and extruded products.
It is also used as a feed substitute for yellow corn in cases of corn shortage and high corn prices.
Supply Almost all flour supply comes from imported wheat which is locally milled into flour.
Imports of flour are minimal at less than one percent of total equivalent flour imports.
In 1996, the high prices of US wheat caused a drop in supply compounded by the health issue on the use of potassium bromate in pan de sal and other bakery products.
Two years later, the severest El Niño phenomenon to hit the country saw agricultural production drop by over 13%.
This told heavily on the demand for flour-based products, drastically reducing wheat import volumes.
According to one biscuit manufacturer, one gauge of good demand for biscuits, cookies, and packed snacks is the good output in agriculture.
Although government figures have not been closed for 2002, it is estimated that supply will again be headed south due to the continuing economic slowdown, among other things.
In the last two years, India has been exporting strongly besting Australia in the process.
Wheat Imports by Country of Origin (tons)
Note: 2002 figures cover Jan.-Oct. only Source:
Foreign Trade Statistics of the Philippines - NSO
The Major Products Based on the 2000 Family Income and Expenditures Survey, the major flour-based products patronized by Philippine households include bread (P23 billion), biscuits (P4.7 billion), noodles (P3.7 billion), and flour (P1 billion).
In terms of absolute values, bread would seem to be the fastest growing segment increasing by P6 billion and P5 billion in 1997 and 2000, respectively.
However, it is growing at a decreasing rate like biscuits and noodles.
It is flour which has been growing at over 70% from 1994.
Family Income and Expenditures Survey - NSO Table 4.
Family Expenditures on Flour-based Products (In million pesos)
Family Income and Expenditure Survey - NSO
Trade A small part of expenditures on flour-based products is accounted for by imported items averaging $15 million (P750 million) over the last five years.
The largest flour based product import is sweet biscuits, waffles, and wafers, with share of over half of the total import value in 2002.
Flour-Based Product Imports
- Nov. only Volume is in kg and value in US$ CIF.
 Source of basic data:
National Statistics Office Contributing to the relative growth of flour-based products is the aggressive establishment and positioning of the players.
From its first store in Mandaue in 1980, Julie's Bakeshop has grown to a little over 300 branches scattered nationwide.
It plans to set up 80 branches annually until 2007.
Fortune Bakeshop and Pan de Manila also added branches.
Some supermarkets also have their own brand of bread products.
Specialty bakeshops have also been sprouting like French Baker, Delifrance, Sugarhouse, Le Coeur de France, Cinnabon, and Cinnzeo.
Country Style Donuts is a relatively new addition to the donut segment while Domino's, Don Henrico's, Little Caesars, Lots-a-Pizza, and comebacking 3M Pizza are trying to make a dent in the pizza business.
In the biscuits, cookies and crackers segment, Monde Nissin bought M.Y. San Biscuits, with Rebisco and URC strengthening their presence.
Other than for local consumption, the country is also able to export flour based products averaging $11 million a year.
The plain biscuits segment contributed the largest export revenue amounting to over P5 million in 2002.
Overall, the country is a net importer of flour based products with a negative trade balance of a little over $3 million in 2002.
This is already the smallest deficit since 1993 when the country registered a positive balance of $74,000.
The year 2002 also marks the highest export value over the last ten years.
Flour-Based Product Exports
- Nov. only Volume is in kg and value in US$; FOB for exports and CIF for imports.
National Statistics Office The increased arrivals of imported flour-based products from 2001 can be traced in part to the reduction of tariff rates as part of the country's commitment to the World Trade Organization.
Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines, various issues
Future Scenarios Wheat will always be part of the Filipino dining table, whether in the form of a pan de sal, pancit, biscuits, hamburger, pasta, pizza, donut, cake, instant noodles, or extruded flour snacks.
The growth of the fastfood industry and the fast paced lifestyle has institutionalized instant foods and ready to eat meals.
Industry estimates indicate that market growth will be around 2-3% over the medium term.
Moreover, the entry of imported pasta and bread products at very low tariff will put additional pressure on the flour milling industry.
Market Information Southeast Asia The Improving Market for Packaged Foods Philippines
Florence E. Mojica Senior Agribusiness Specialist Center for Food and Agri Business University of Asia and the Pacific
Packaged food is a multi-billion peso industry in the country.
It is a major source of employment, investments and output for the Philippine economy.
The industry is not a homogenous entity.
It is composed of several categories as many as the varieties of products consumed, as follows:
• Cereal preparations;
• Meat preparations;
• Fish and marine products;
• Dairy products and eggs;
• Processed fruits and vegetables;
• Non-alcoholic beverages;
• Coffee, cocoa and tea; and
• Other food commodities such as sugar products, sauces and condiments and cooking oil.
This paper dissects the eight categories of packaged foods as defined by the National Statistics Office (NSO).
Figures presented are household spending for each category.
Cereal preparations Cereal preparations include flour, bread, biscuits and cookies, cakes and baked goods, pastries, breakfast cereals, pasta and noodles.
Total household expenditures for this category reached P215.6 billion (B) in 2000 compared to only P125.6B in 1994.
Among the major contributors are flour and noodles.
NSO-FIES Total household expenditure on flour reached P1.04B in 2000 per NSO Family Income and Expenditures Survey (FIES).
Bread consumption increased by 28% from P18B in 1997 to P23B in 2000.
Spending on biscuits totaled P4.7B in 2000 up by P400 million (M) from 1997.
Spending on noodles (categorized into bihon, miki, miswa, sotanghon, macaroni, etc.) reached P3.7B in 2000.
Instant noodles, on the other hand, are valued at P6B in 2000, with growth estimated at 16% p.a. Household spending for flour is very small.
Most of flour goes to non-household as flour demand is highly dependent on the industries it supplies, that is, bakery goods, noodles and pasta.
Flour is primarily an intermediate good.
Bakeries constitute its biggest market at about 80%.
Growth in bakery production translates to higher sales for the flour milling industry.

Meat preparations In 2000, household spending on canned and uncanned meat preparations amounted to P32.4B (NSO-FIES).
Meat processors market their goods either directly to retailers and institutions or through dealers.
When demand increases, they source some of their requirements from abroad.
Processed meat imports have significantly increased since the 1990s.
The meat processing industry is expected to benefit from increased consumer spending and the expansion of the fastfood industry.
San Miguel Purefoods Corporation is the top meat processor in the country accounting for more than half of the processed meat market.
Swift Foods, Inc. is a far second with around 30%.
These players cater mainly to the household sector and, to a lesser extent, the institutional markets.

Fish and marine products Fish and marine products consist of canned fish, dried/smoked fish, salted fish and other processed marine products.
Total household spending reached P104B in 2000 compared to only P59.2B in 1994.
NSO-FIES Expenditures on processed fish and marine products reached P19B in 2000.
Dried fish accounted for the bulk (54%) followed by canned fish (34%), salted fish (11%) and other processed products (1%).

Dairy products and eggs Dairy products and eggs include condensed milk, evaporated milk, powdered milk, fresh milk, ice cream, other dairy products, and fresh and processed eggs (e.g. balut, salted eggs, etc.). In 2000, total family expenditure amounted to P54.1B from P42.8B in 1997 (NSO-FIES).
Of the total spending, 56% went to powdered milk and 26% to fresh eggs.
The Philippine milk industry is dominated by four major milk processors.
There is no local dairy industry to speak of, despite the government's efforts to encourage its development.
The Philippines imports 99% of its milk requirements either as finished goods or skim milk powder for further processing.
Nestle remains the market leader nation-wide.
This is due to its strong position in the fast growing powdered milk sub-sector.
The liquid milk sub-sector, on the other hand, is dominated by Alaska Milk Corporation.
The Philippine ice cream industry is composed of two major players - Nestle and Selecta - and a number of smaller niche foreign and local brands.
Ice cream consumption is seasonal; it is generally stronger in the second and fourth quarters of the year.
The second quarter not only covers the hot summer months of April and May but also the fiesta season, while Christmas falls during the latter part of the year.
NSO-FIES Coca-Cola Bottlers Inc. is the country's traditional leader in softdrink production and distribution.
Pepsi Cola Products Phils., Inc. has been a distant follower.
Cosmos Bottling Corporation is believed to be second to Coca-Cola.
Cosmos has been aggressively eating market share.
The market for softdrink is quite price sensitive, as evidenced by the success of Cosmos' low price strategy to steal market share in the 1990s.
La Tondeña Distillers, Inc. is currently the largest fruit juice producer in the country by its acquisition of Sugarland International.
Its competitors include multinationals such as Kraft (Tang) and local companies such as Zest-O Corporation (Zest-O) and Selecta Dairy Products, Inc.
Sunkist Powdered Sugarland Multifood, Inc.
Sunkist Zest-O Corporation Sunglo Concentrates 7D International Mango 7D Marina Sales, Inc.
Katas Canned Del Monte Phils., Inc.
The market for bottled water has been the fastest growing segment in the beverage industry.
Such rapid growth is due mainly to the industry's relatively small size and the insufficient supply of potable water in some parts of the country.
In soluble coffee, Nestle enjoys 90% of the market.
Other food commodities Other food commodities include sugar products (e.g. candies and chocolates), sauces (e.g. mayonnaise, catsup, soy sauce, fish sauce, etc.), other spices and seasoning (e.g. black pepper, vinegar, garlic, ginger, MSG, etc.) and cooking oil.
Aggregate household spending on sugar products stood at P3B in 2000, the same level as of 1997.
Total family spending on sauces grew by 30% to P7.3B in 2000.
Household expenditure on other spices and seasoning totaled P10.9B in 2000 from P8.8B in 1997.
Aggregate spending on cooking oil stood at P9.8B in 2000.
CONCLUSIONS Several conclusions can be drawn about the Philippine packaged food industry: 1.
Few dominate the various categories, say two to four players (for example, ice cream, softdrinks, milk and meat) and only one for coffee (with Nestle cornering 90% of the market).
If there happens to be more players, only a handful corner the majority of the market share, the rest remain as marginal players (i.e. bottled water, chicken, etc.). 2.
Those that reflect very strong demand growth of 10% and over are ice cream, fruit juices, and bottled water.
Meanwhile, the rest - softdrink, milk and others - reflect slower growth of less than 10%.
The threat of foreign imports is high and is seen to further intensify once the 0-5% tariff takes effect in 2004.
Imports of canned meat products i.e. luncheon meat and corned beef, have significantly grown since the 1990s.
With the opening up of the market, competition with local producers may bring down prices and could increase household consumption.
Overall, the packaged food industry is set to benefit from increasing disposable incomes, on the back of higher economic growth.
Principal markets would continue to be the middle and upper consumer groups accounting for 15-20% of the population.
As lifestyle changes, demand for convenience proliferates among more working women with fast-paced lifestyles leading to increasing demand for packaged foods.
Improvement in the distribution system also contributes significantly to higher sales even in far flung areas.
Market Information Southeast Asia A Closer Look at Philippine  Vegetable Imports*
Ditas R. Macabasco Agribusiness Specialist Center for Food and Agri Business  University of Asia and the Pacific Local vegetable growers have been complaining since last year about the influx of imported vegetables into the country.
In 2002 alone, the country imported about $6.4 million (P328.7 million1) worth of fresh/chilled vegetables as compared to $5.8 million (P295 million2) the previous year, according to the National Statistics Office.
The figure excludes those that have entered the country through illegal means (smuggling).
According to news reports, the latter have been quite rampant in the past several months.
Import trends The Philippines imports more than 30 kinds of fresh/chilled vegetables which include tomatoes, onions and shallots, garlic, leeks, cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage lettuce (head lettuce), witloof chicory, carrots, turnips, radishes, cucumber, peas, beans, mushrooms, truffles, celery and spinach.
Since the country's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), imports of fresh/chilled vegetables have grown about seven-fold from 3,900 tons in 1996 to 27,500 tons in 2002, with peak at 37,800 tons in 1999 (Figure 1).
Import value likewise increased during the period from $2.6 million to $6.4 million.
Mean annual growth rate was 60% on volume and 25% on value.

Smuggled vegetables Official statistics indicated import growth for fresh/chilled vegetable between 2001 and 2002 at only 3% on volume and 10% on value.
The figures are lower compared to the growth rates registered in the previous years.
Local vegetable growers, however, are complaining.
The reason?
They noticed a slowdown in the trading of their products especially in July and August of last year.
The culprit?
The increasing incidence of smuggling (of vegetables and other agricultural products like fruits, meat, etc.) into the country despite the low tariffs on imports.
The smuggled vegetables, said to be coming from China, Taiwan and Australia, include broccoli, lettuce, carrot, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, potato and mushrooms.
These are locally known as "Baguio vegetables."
La Trinidad, Benguet and Mountain Province are the country's leading producers of the so-called "Baguio vegetables."
According to Mayor Fongwan of La Trinidad, Benguet, official figures from the Department of Agriculture (DA) on imported vegetables are understated.
For instance, from July to October 15, 2002, the DA estimated vegetable imports to have reached only 300 tons while a La Trinidad Task Force indicated the volume of smuggled vegetables have amounted to 900 tons (Philippine Daily Inquirer, November 1, 2002).
In a meeting of the National Agriculture and Fishery Council (NAFC) Subcommittee on Fruits and Vegetables last February, the smuggling of agricultural products into the country was discussed.
Eden Dandal of the Bureau of Customs (BoC) cited that smuggling rose by more than 100% after the termination of the contract with Society General d' Surveillance, an international organization which, among others, pre-inspects in all points of origin agricultural goods for export to the Philippines.
Further, in a more recent NAFC meeting, the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service (CIIS) of the BoC reported that as of June 9 this year, they have apprehended nine (9) container vans of vegetables worth about P5.4 million.
Three (3) of the container vans contained carrots with estimated worth of P1.8 million and six (6) had onions valued at P3.6 million.
The shipments were either abandoned or did not possess the necessary import permit from the Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI).
The consignees were Magnificent Touch Commercial and Asia Golden Sun, Inc. for the carrot shipments and Carl's International Traders, Pine Trade International Services, and Asia Golden Luck, Inc. for onions.
Just recently, the BoC has also apprehended four (4) container vans of carrots and two (2) container vans of ginger from China.
In addition, the CIIS also reported that they have condemned 40 container vans of vegetables last May.
These were abandoned shipments containing rotten vegetables which have been at the ports for about 3 months to a year already
Why the influx of imported vegetables?
The main contributory factor is the reduction in tariff rates.
Other reasons include the changing landscape for fresh produce marketing as well as increased demand for the products.
The rise in imports is attributed mainly to the reduction in tariffs brought about by the WTO.
Tariffs on most fresh/chilled vegetables have gone down to 3% to 10% in 2003, with the exception of a few products, namely, garlic, onions, shallots and cabbages whose tariffs are at 50% (Table 3).

* prior to issuance of EO 197 ** based on EO 197 dated April 16, 2003 Source:
Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines Amid the influx of cheap vegetables especially from Taiwan, China and Australia, however, local vegetable growers filed a petition with the Department of Agriculture (DA) for an increase in vegetable tariff rates from mostly 7% to 40%.
Thus, on April 16, 2003, Malacañang issued Executive Order (EO) No. 197 modifying the nomenclature and the rates of import duty on various products under Section 104 of the Tariff and Customs Code of 1978 (Presidential Decree No. 1464, as amended).
Under the EO, tariffs on most vegetables were increased to 20 to 25%.
The approved rates were lower than what was petitioned because higher tariffs may push prices up and further encourage smuggling.
Imported vegetables are said to be cheaper by about 30-50% compared to locally produced ones (Business World, January 17, 2003).
Further, imports are better packaged (especially those coming from Australia) which makes them more attractive to supermarkets.
(Domestic producers, however, claim that the country's vegetables are better tasting and more nutritious.)
Further, some companies turn to imports to provide them with year-round supply of a wider variety of vegetables.
Changing landscape for fresh produce marketing.
In the past, fresh vegetables (and other fresh produce) are sold mainly in the wet markets.
Now, supermarkets, food chains, hotels and restaurants, airline food service providers have emerged as important buyers.
Many supermarkets (e.g. SM, Rustan's, Robinson's) now have a "fresh section" offering products ranging from meat, fish, fruits and vegetables.
To ensure a year-round supply of a wider variety of quality fresh products, imports are brought in.
Meanwhile, rapid urbanization and fast-paced lifestyles have increased the incidence of eating out and thus, have also boosted demand for fresh produce by the food service sector.
Increased demand.
Consumption of fresh vegetables has also expanded partly because of increased exposure in supermarkets, restaurants and hotels.
In fact, a number of large hotels and supermarkets have started to directly import fresh vegetables to ensure reliable supply of quality vegetables.
In addition, rising incomes and increasing health consciousness among consumers are expected to further boost demand.
These are the very reasons why farmers have pushed for higher tariffs and a tighter watch on smuggling.
It is a good thing that Malacañang heeded the call of farmers for higher tariffs on vegetable imports.
It is also good that the DA, through the BPI, in coordination with the BoC, has intensified efforts to curb smuggling by tightening inspection procedures and import permit issuance.
In other countries, quarantine inspection is the first line of defense against imported fruits and vegetables which do not comply with their sanitary and phyto-sanitary requirements.
Thus, the NAFC came up with a resolution urging the BPI to implement mandatory quarantine inspection of all imported fruits and vegetables in coordination with the BoC.
According to the BoC, such is already being done.
Further, the DA and the Department of Finance also plans to recommend the issuance of an EO to penalize smuggling of agricultural products.
But much remains to be done to make the local vegetable industry competitive.
The supply chain must be addressed.
For instance, there is need to enhance production technologies to further increase supply and improve quality.
There is need to develop marketing infrastructure (e.g. cold chains and packing houses to lessen post-harvest losses, farm to market roads to lower transport/freight costs, etc.). Overall, there is need to continue improving on cost, quality, supply reliability, appropriate product innovation and customer service which are the very attributes of competitiveness.
Market Information Southeast Asia A Peek into the Philippine Convenience Store Industry*
Ronald Mark G. Omaña Researcher Center for Food and Agri Business  University of Asia and the Pacific The food retailing industry encompasses a wide range of sellers from the sari-sari stores, sidewalk vendors, wet and dry markets to the groceries, supermarkets, hypermarts, and warehouse and discount clubs.
Along this scale of retailers is the modern version of sari-sari stores known as convenience stores.
They are usually open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Another unique feature is its promotion of self-service on fastfood items.
HISTORY The convenience store concept was introduced in the Philippines in 1984 by local company Philippine Seven Corporation (PSC) when it bought the license to put up the popular American convenience store 7-Eleven.
Since it set foot in the country, 7-Eleven has maintained its dominant position in the industry.
It took a long period before another c-store opened shop.
In 1997, Uniwide Holdings Incorporated established its own c-store chain under the brand name Uniwide Family Stores.
It was a virtual threat until it encountered financial difficulties in 1999 forcing it to sell its 40 outlets to I-Mart International Corporation.
The same firm bought the Aboitiz Group's entry into the industry - the Super 24 stores.
I-Mart redeveloped the acquired stores and turned them into co-branding set up - a convenience store and a pharmacy in one outlet.
As of end-2002, I-Mart has 62 stores all located in Metro Manila.
Another c-store named EASY Mart managed to establish about 20 stores also in Metro Manila.
In early 2003, I-Mart and EASY Mart announced their stores' closure.
Industry sources say the two c-stores could not sustain their operations due to financial difficulties.
The Floro family, in the mid-90s, brought into the country the franchise for the AM/PM convenience stores.
The stores have also ceased to operate towards the end of the period.
The holding company Mateo Management Group (MMG) also entered the industry with its MMG 2000 c-stores in 2000 but shut down operations early this year.
Gas marts or c-stores in gasoline stations, meanwhile, clicked following their establishment in major road networks such as the North and South Expressways.
Gas marts differ from the traditional c-stores in terms of location and target customers.
The traditional c-stores cater primarily to the nearby communities and transient people while gas marts target the motorists.
KEY PLAYERS 7-Eleven is owned by listed firm Philippine Seven Corporation.
It is the industry's market leader.
PSC is majority-controlled by the President Chain Store Corporation of Taiwan since 2000 following the effectivity of the Retail Trade Liberalization Act allowing foreign companies to invest in retail firms.
The President Chain Store Corp. is also a 7-Eleven licensee in Taiwan.
Mini Stop is owned and operated by Robinsons Convenience Store Inc.
- a joint venture between the Gokongwei family of the Robinsons chain of department stores and supermarkets, and Mitsubishi Corp. and Mini Stop Co.
Ltd. of Japan.
The company's first c-store was opened in 2000.
Bingo! - Launched in 1990, Bingo! is owned by Jollimart Philippines Corporation, formerly a wholly-owned company by the group behind fastfood industry leader Jollibee Foods Corporation (JFC) until it sold 60% of the company to retail magnate Henry Sy of the SM Group of Companies in 1999.
Mercury Drug Superstores are owned and operated by the Mercury Drug Corporation.
These stores are normally located beside the company's drug stores.
With the exception of Mercury Drug's "Superstores" all the other c-stores are operating on a 24-hour basis and are all located in Luzon.
In addition, the superstores do not sell fastfood products and focus only on medicines, and health products.
The Hortaleza family's HBC tried for some time the c-store concept by combining food and beauty products but decided later on to just focus on its tried and tested business of retailing only beauty products.
Another player is Tropical Hut fastfood chain owner Manuel Que's 10*Q convenience stores with three branches in Metro Manila.
Gas marts, meanwhile, were pioneered by Shell Philippines Inc. in 1993 with its Shell Select stores in its gas stations.
Its competitors, Caltex Philippines and Petron Corporation followed suit with Star Mart and Treats c-stores, respectively.
The entry of new players in the petroleum retailing industry in the late 1990s further expanded the number of c-stores such as Seaoil's Palamig and Total Petroleum's La Botique.

DEMAND DRIVERS The industry has gone a long way from its beginnings in the 1980s.
While no estimates are available on the total value of the c-store industry, PSC alone, the market leader, has registered revenues of P3.014 billion in 2002, up by 3% from P2.925 billion in 2001.
The figure, however, was lower by 4% compared to its sales performance in 1998 amounting to P3.138 billion (See Figure 1).
Philippine Seven Corporation Revenues, 1998-2002 Source:
Considering these, it is important to know how the spending on food and beverages has been doing for the past years.
According to the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) of the National Statistics Office (NSO), household spending on food reached P786 billion in 2000, up by 26% from P624 billion in 1997.
The entire Luzon region, where the c-stores are mostly located, accounted for 67% of total family expenditure on food, equivalent to P529 billion in 2000.
In 1997, the region's household food expenditure was at P416 billion, representing 65% of the country's total spending on food.
Personal consumption expenditure (PCE) on food and beverages in 2002, meanwhile, reached about P448 billion from P401.7 billion in 1998.
From 1998 to 2002, the average annual growth rate was about 3%.
Total Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) and PCE on Food and Beverage, 1998-2002 Source:
National Statistical Coordination Board Another important demand driver is the country's growing population.
Based on the NSO's Census of Population, there are 76.5 million in Filipinos in 2000 with expansion rate of 1.8 million persons/year.
The number would be reaching about 82 million this 2003.
Population for Luzon, as of 2000, reached about 9 million.
Increasing number of people in urban areas indicates a growing market for c-stores.
The FIES also reported rising total household income from P1,748 billion in 1997 to P2,199 billion in 2000.
Luzon was the biggest income producer in the country accounting for 70% of total income for both periods.
Visayas' share stood at 17.7% while Mindanao captured 19.4% in 2000.
Other demand drivers for c-stores include: (1) expanding number of working women with modified lifestyles; (2) the fast-paced lifestyles among working people in the urban areas; and (3) the round-the-clock convenience that c-stores provide to customers that need to make "emergency" shopping trips at any time of the day.
STORE SUCCESS FACTORS Location is a very important factor for success.
C-stores usually locate in areas with high foot traffic.
Thus, players have started to invade office buildings, malls, as well as the LRT and MRT stations.
Store layout also matters as the overall look and "feel" of the outlets affect customer count.
Pricing and marketing strategies are also important tools because players also have to compete and keep-up with the prices of goods sold in other c-stores, markets, supermarkets and groceries.
Industry sources say value meals or 'combo' meals are now a must for any c-store as customers have been observed to be more attracted to purchase these especially with the declining peso purchasing power.
Further promotion of the c-store concept is another key consideration.
Players perceive that many people still prefer buying from sidewalk vendors and the traditional sari-sari store rather than from c-stores.
Lastly, a must for c-stores is to have an efficient distribution and logistics system considering its significant effect to its pricing and marketing strategies.
PROSPECTS Players expect the industry to flourish more in the next five years primarily because the country is not yet saturated with c-stores particularly Luzon.
Currently, c-stores number only a little over 600 with main concentration in Metro Manila and in other parts of Luzon.
In the United States, there are more than 120,000 outlets as of 2001.
In Taiwan, 7-Eleven alone operates more than 2,000 branches while Mini Stop operates 1,200 outlets in Japan and Korea.
Players do not yet see the need to set up c-stores in the Visayas and Mindanao.
Moreover, they have yet to study the logistics requirements and constraints before expanding outside the Luzon area.
The high cost of setting-up an outlet is also pushing the players to tap on franchising to fuel their expansion plans.
It was estimated that a 140 square meter outlet would require about P5 million to build and furnish.
7-Eleven at present has five franchised outlets while Mini Stop recently announced targets of putting up more than 300 stores by the end of 2003 - 75% of which would be coming from franchisees.
Jollimart's Bingo! is expected to offer franchises within the year.
A study conducted by research firm AC Nielsen on retail trade in the Asia-Pacific cited that modern store formats are fast replacing traditional stores in the region including the Philippines.
Sari-sari stores face rationalization unless they carry more product lines to attract more customers.
C-stores, without a doubt, are here to stay.
Despite the closure of I-Mart and Easy Mart, the aggressive plans of new entrant Mini Stop will surely perk up the competition.
Expanding incomes and food expenditures will definitely help spur growth for the industry.

Market Information Southeast Asia Fish and Seafood - Market Overview Vietnam July 2003
The Canadian Embassy in Vietnam 31 Hung Vuong St. Hanoi, Vietnam Tel.: (011-84-4) 823-5500 Fax: (011-84-4) 823-5333 E-mail: hanoi-td@dfait-maeci.gc.ca Internet: http://www.infoexport.gc.ca/vn
Market Overview While market prospects are limited in this sector because Vietnam is a significant producer and exporter of seafood, the abundant supply of marine products and the availability of low cost labour represents an opportunity for Canadian firms to establish processing facilities in Vietnam and export value-added products.
In 2001, Vietnam imported about $55 million(1) of sea products, mainly salmon, crab meat, and caviar from Norway, France, the U.S. and other countries.
Opportunities Based on the technological inputs and available resources, Vietnam's seafood products market can be divided into two categories: semi-processed products (raw materials are simply processed and sent for further processing and packaged elsewhere), and high value-added products.
For Canadian products, this sector is confined to small markets for shellfish and smoked salmon, mostly in the upscale hotel and restaurant sector, although competition here is intense.
Vietnam has ambitious plans to expand and upgrade its own production of seafood.
While some of these plans will likely be scaled back due to lack of available financing and other considerations, it is still expected that the growth in seafood production (and exports) should healthily outpace the growth in population.
However, with the continuing rise in income levels of many urban Vietnamese, Canadian suppliers of higher quality (and higher margin) products should be ready to anticipate growth to "critical mass" levels for export in the next five to 10 years.
The Vietnamese Ministry of Fisheries is calling for additional investment through the Overseas Development Agency (ODA) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the following areas:
• aqua-culture (with a concentration in shrimp breeding and inputs);
• upgrade of vessels for deep-sea fishing (larger engines, chilling and storing equipment); and
• upgrade of processing facilities.
Two main Vietnamese export products, catfish and shrimp, have been subjected to anti-dumping and phyto-sanitary measures from major exporters, such as the United States, the European Union and Canada.
Standards of local partners can be low and are often inefficiently managed.
Deep-sea fishing by foreigners is prohibited.
Tariffs for some seafood products are high, but these may be reduced during upcoming World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations.

Labelling Regulations in Malaysia
Under the Food Act and the Food Regulations, certain information must be stated in the label of a food product.
It is compulsory for all process food products to state the name of the manufacturer and packer or the importer.
The label should also contain the weight or volume, designation of food, brand, content or list of ingredients listed in accordance to proportion or weight, additives and storage instructions.
Expiry dates are only compulsory for certain products mainly perished food, goods with short shelf life and products which contain certain ingredients.
The "use by" date or "best before" date is determined by the manufacturer based on past experience on how long their products can last.
Manufacturers are supposed to call back their products after the expiry dates.
Nutritional information or labelling is optional except for baby food, processed food for children, cereal and food for dietary purposes.
Nutrition labels state the nutrient contents such as vitamins and minerals, fat, fibre, energy, carbohydrate and protein in the food product.
The types of food for which expiry date is mandatory under the Food Regulations 1985
• Biscuit, bread
• canned foods for Infants and children chocolate, white chocolate and milk chocolate
• coconut cream, coconut milk powder and desiccated coconut
• edible fat and edible oil other than margarine in hermetically sealed containers
• food additives with a shelf life of less than 18 months infant formula
• liquid egg yolk, liquid egg white, dried egg, dried egg yolk and dried egg white
• a meat products in non-hermetically sealed containers milk and milk products other than hard cheese 5.
Special purpose foods which require nutritional labelling
• infant formula
• canned food for infants and children cereal-based food for infants and children
Terminology of nutritional labelling Enriched Flour and other grain products lose some nutrients during the refining process.
Some of these nutrients are replaced in the "enriched" product.
Fortified Some foods are "fortified" with vitamins and minerals not normally found in these products.
"Fortified" whole wheat and whole-grain products are usually more nutritious than "enriched" products.
Supplements Supplements include any mineral, vitamin, essential fatty acid which, when added either singly or in combination to food, improves or enriches the nutrient content of food.
Pure The food is free from any other added substance apart from any those essential in the processing of such food.
Key Food Labelling Requirements for the Philippines
The lead government agency in the Philippines tasked with food labelling regulations is the Bureau of Food & Drugs (BFAD) of the Department of Health.
The Philippine general regulatory guidelines which includes labelling of prepackaged foods for distribution are in Administrative Order No. 88-B series 1984 - Rules and Regulations Governing the Labeling of Prepackaged Food Products Distributed in the Philippines.
The above regulations are patterned after Codex Alimentarius guidelines and those of USFDA's.
For a complete copy of the guidelines, visit BFAD's website at: http://www.doh.gov.ph/bfad2/main.htm it is found under "Food Section", "Regulatory Guidelines."
This study could be downloaded from the Agriculture Trade Service website at http://ats.agr.ca/info/asean-e.htm#Philippines. Following is a brief overview of the labelling regulations:
It must not contain anything, e.g. word, statements, designs, or devices, (including overly prominent words or pictures), that will mislead the shopper/consumer.
• Unless exempted by the food regulations, e.g. under small package exemptions, etc., the label must contain: a) The name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer and/or distributor. b) An accurate statement of the quantity of the contents in terms of weight, measure or numerical count. c) The name and address of the importer for imported foods.
• A description of the product which complies with the definition and standard of identity that has been prescribed by law, i.e. the common or usual name of the food, including the common names of optional ingredients (other than spices, flavouring, and colouring) that are present in the product.
• The names of any artificial flavouring, artificial colouring or chemical preservatives that are included in the product.
• The label of food that is marketed for special dietary uses, e.g. diabetic foods, must include information concerning its vitamin, mineral and other dietary properties as required by the BFAD and in a manner that fully informs purchasers as to the product's intrinsic value in terms of its special use.
Local regulations do, in some cases, require different labelling content, e.g., in the case of a small number of products.
These include bottled water and frozen meats, and prepackaged processed meats, which are covered by specific labelling regulations that have been developed by BFAD and the Department of Agriculture.
Singapore - General Labelling Requirments Relating to Prepacked Food & Beverages
Singapore food import regulations, dictated under the Sale of Goods Act (Chapter 283), requires that all packaged food and beverage products be properly labelled.
The law allows for the labels to have more than one language(subject to wording size and space), but all basic information must have English as the base language.
The Food Regulations also contain general and specific restrictions over labels with health claims, and all medical statements must be supported by scientific facts.
To date, nutritional labelling is only required when a nutrition claim is made.
Specific wording on labels are also required for irradiated foods, products with artificial sweeteners and Royal Jelly.
Some basic guidelines include:
• Name or description of product:
The common name of the food or beverage given must be sufficient to indicate the true nature of the product.
Trademarks or brandnames not specific to the actual product nature can only be used in conjunction with the proper common name or product description.
• Ingredient List:
It is required that a complete list of ingredients be depicted on the label.
If respective actual quantities are not indicated, they should be listed in descending order of their proportion by weight.
• Net Quantity:
All products, except intoxicating liquors and soft drinks, should have an indication of content quantity.
The minimum quantity should be listed in terms of volumetric measures (ml,litres) , net weight(g or Kg) or any internationally acceptable unit of measure.
For weight measure, "Net" shall be used to describe the manner of measurement.
• Wording Size for Label:

It is the responsibility of local importers to ensure that the products imported comply with all food and labelling regulations stipulated in the Sale of Goods Act.
Canadian companies requiring additional information on import and labelling requirements can contact the Canadian High Commission in Singapore.
Food Labelling Requirements for Thailand
All imported food products for sale in Thailand at the retail consumer level whether fresh, frozen or processed are required to bear labels using the Thai language.
Food products for retail sale must have labelling in Thai on the product prior to entry into Thailand.
This can take the form of a stick-on label containing the mandatory information.
Failure to apply the label before entry may result in a penalty fee by the Customs Department and product seizure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
• Name of food
• Net content of food in metric system
• Date, month and year of manufacture; month and year of manufacture; date, month and year of expiry; or date, month and year within which food remains in good quality or conforms to the standard

Food Labelling Requirements for Vietnam
Labelling for all domestic, exported and imported foods in Vietnam must meet the requirements in "Goods Labelling Regulations" and "Food Labelling Regulations", promulgated in 1999 by the Prime Minister's Decision, the Circular of the Ministry of Trade and the Circular of the Ministry of Public Health.
The Ministry of Public Health of Vietnam and its city and provincial departments are responsible for food labelling inspection.
Processed foodstuffs, raw and fresh foodstuffs, essential commodities and necessities that are not prepackaged and sold directly to consumers; and prepackaged foods and drinks which have a consumption validity within 24 hours are not under the governance of this regulation.
Compulsory content of food labels which contain the most important information about food products must be inscribed on the Principal Display Panel (PDP).
• Labels of goods to be circulated in the country must be inscribed in Vietnamese, but depending on the requirements of each type of goods, they may be inscribed in foreign languages but in smaller sizes.
• Name of goods shall be inscribed in letters with the height not shorter than two millimetres.
• All letters, numerals, drawings, images, signs and/or marks on food labels must be clear and true to the real properties of goods.
They must not be ambiguously inscribed, thus causing misunderstanding to consumers.
• Net weight, volume or measures of food products.
• Names and addresses of manufacturers or importers.
• Composition: prepackaged foodstuffs and drinks which are composed of two or more components must have the components listed on the labels.
• Production date, durable life date and preservation duration must be inscribed according to calendar date, month and year.
• Country of origin.
• Types and sorts of additives must be stated clearly, if it is natural, artificial or synthetic, group name, international code, chemical formula, composition and molecular weight, etc...
• Preservation instruction and its usage.
• Food produced through genetic modification must be indicated as such.
• Food products using radiative technology in manufacturing, processing and preserving requires written statement such as "irradiated" or "treated with irradiation".
• Details of the nutritious food products: content, name and quantity of special additives.
• Dietary food products must be labelled with detail specifications.
The importers could inscribe additional information, if any, such as: industrial property protection, awards and certificates of international standards...
Market Information Southeast Asia Welcome
• Regulatory barriers in the European Union are often difficult to circumvent.
• Doing business in China is difficult, unpredictable and mostly unprofitable.
If you agree with these, than markets in South East Asia (SEA) await your attention.
SEA has some of the fastest growing economies in the world, and a consumer population demanding better and safer food choices from international suppliers.
Don't think of SEA countries as economic disasters.
They have recovered well from the 1997 economic crisis.
Per capita incomes are rising in SEA due to economic growth, and domestic consumption is increasingly important in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.
Vietnam has the highest GDP growth in the region, and because of its low population growth, per capita GDP will exceed that of the Philippines in about 7 years.
Consumers who would be attracted to buy Canadian products have more spending power to buy more prepared foods and dine out more often.
The predicted rise of currencies in the region against the US dollar over the next 5 years will also contribute to rising per capita incomes in US$ terms.
As my predecessor wrote, "Growth in the SEA food manufacturing sector is creating solid opportunities for food ingredients, while the increasing regional dominance of major supermarket chains such as Cold Storage, Giant, Carrefour & Tesco is creating opportunity for branded and private labels for serious Canadian suppliers."
Exports to the region in 2004 increased from a 5-year low in 2003 to $555 million, almost $100 million higher than in 2003 when Canadian field crop supplies were low.
If you are a value-added exporter, you should know that value added product exports to the region continue to claim a higher percentage of total exports.
The growing consumer demand for Western-style food products and the dependence on many imported foodstuffs makes the SEA region a very attractive market for Canadian food and beverage products.
If you are interested in exploring this market, do not hesitate to contact one of our team members who can be immense assistance to your efforts in this varied and dynamic region.

• India is the seventh largest country in the world in terms of land area, but is the second largest according to population.
• India's structural reforms and the development of a modern economic base have led to the country becoming the tenth largest economy in the world.
• India has a burgeoning middle class and has made great strides in fields such as information technology and agriculture.
• Total Canada-India merchandise trade for 2004 reached approximately US$1.9 billion.
Canada's exports were valued at US$681 million, while imports from India were US $1.2 billion, resulting in a negative trade balance of roughly US$519 million.
• Canada's top agricultural exports to India in 2004 were: dried peas, chickpeas, lentils and mustard seed.
Geography India is the seventh largest country in the world in terms of land area.
It is located in the southern peninsula of Asia, bordered by Pakistan, China, Bangladesh, Burma, Nepal, Bhutan and Afghanistan.
The country is a subcontinent measuring 3,214 km from north to south and 2,933 km from east to west.
Its coastline is over 7,000 km long and its total area is approximately 3.3 million square kilometers, with 54.4% being arable land.
Politically, the country is divided into 28 states, six federally administered union territories and a National Capital Territory (Delhi).

Economy India's economic transition from an agriculture-base to an industrial and commercial economy has progressed rapidly.
Since the 1990s, structural reforms and stabilization programs have contributed to India's sustained economic growth.
The emergence of "New Economy" sectors, such as information technology, telecommunications, media and entertainment, have become vital to India's development.
Overall, India has created a modern economy with a largely self-sufficient agriculture sector, diversified industry and a sophisticated financial and service sector.
Estimates show that from 1993-94 to 2003-04, India's GDP has grown at an average rate of 6.2% per year.
In 2004, GDP per capita was US$629 and US$3,100 when measured in purchasing power parity terms.
Agriculture plays an exceptionally important role in India's economy, employing approximately 60% of the workforce and accounting for 25% of GDP.
The service sector, which includes trade, hotels, banking, transport and communications, now accounts for 48% of GDP and employs 23% of the workforce.
Industry makes up the remaining 17% of workers and holds a 28% share of national income.
In recent years, Indian foreign trade has greatly increased.
A serious financial crisis in 1991 led to major economic reforms, which removed many government regulations on investment and trade.
Furthermore, India was an initial member of the World Trade Organization when it was established in 1995.
Subsequently, quantitative restrictions on imports were gradually phased out and eliminated in 2002.
During the period from 1999 to 2004, imports increased at an average rate of 17.4% per year and exports rose by an annual average rate of 16.7%.
The one area where growth has been sluggish is foreign direct investment (FDI).
During the last few years, FDI has been approximately 1% of GDP.
It is also estimated that India's share of total FDI into developing countries (such as China, Mexico, Brazil etc.) is only about 2% to 3%.
Despite rapid economic growth, there are distinct disparities in wealth between India's states.
More prosperous areas such as Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat hold approximately 28% of the total population and 52% of the country's GDP.
In contrast, poorer areas like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar combine to account for 42% of the population and 34% of national income.
Government Role India's recent economic success has come largely through strict government guidance.
While this is mainly targeted at boosting exports, particularly in agriculture and handicrafts, the plan is also looking to make imports more affordable.
Despite the fact that India is committed to encouraging broad-based growth and macroeconomic stability, many of the government's current trade and investment policies protect sectors that are identified as being in a "period of adjustment."
Tariffs have been used to achieve this.
However, the country is committed to progressively reducing import tariffs.
Excise duties are also being simplified, and the government is moving towards implementing a countrywide Value Added Tax (VAT).
The declining role of the public sector as both a producer and consumer has been very important to India's recent growth.
However, it is still a significant player in the economy.
In 2002-03, public sector expenditures were 29% of GDP.
About 85% of total government spending was put towards interest payments, defence, subsidies, and general services such police and pensions.
India has the second largest population in the world, with 70% living in rural regions.
Much of the country's purchasing power, however, comes from those living in the urban areas.
It is estimated that 300 million people are considered middle class.
As incomes rise, this group has begun developing a taste for imported products.
However, despite rapid economic development, India's market for imported consumer goods still remains small relative to the number of people.
Demographics Total Population 1.08 billion (2005) Population Growth Rate 1.4% (2005) Breakdown by Age (2005) 0-14 yrs 31.2% 15-64 yrs 63.9% 65 yrs and over 4.9% Life Expectancy (2005) Male 63.57 Female 65.16 Total 64.35 As is the case for China and the US, India is better described as a series of regional markets each with a strong cultural identity and marketing characteristics.
For instance, every region or large city has its own distinct culinary tradition.
The common thread is that culture, dining and food are strongly intertwined.
Moreover, an exceptionally large number of Indians are vegetarian.
While most do not eat meat simply because they cannot afford a non-vegetarian diet, cultural aspects must also be taken into consideration.
Sikh's currently comprise 2% of the Indian population and 81% are Hindu.
Both these religions consider cattle to be sacred and eating beef is taboo.
In addition, 13% are Muslim (this is the second largest Muslim population after Indonesia).
Under this religion, pork is not eaten.
According to traditional Hinduism, food is classified into three distinct categories.
"Sattavic" which is freshly cooked, pure vegetarian (excluding some root crops).
It is traditionally eaten by Yogis, saints and upper caste Brahmins and is said to calm the mind.
"Rajasic" is non-vegetarian cuisine enriched with spices, dry fruits, butter and cream.
It is eaten by the royal class and is said to invigorate the mind and body.
"Tamasic" includes preserved/stored meat and leftovers.
It is eaten by the lower classes and is said to make the body and mind lethargic.
Although this classification is a thing of the past, many Indians still believe food shapes the personality, mood and mind.
Many Indians are quite willing to try new foods, but usually return to traditional cuisine.
While Western foods have a reasonably good chance of succeeding for casual dining, integrating them into the main meal will be more difficult.
Indians prefer fresh products and traditional spices and ingredients, which has greatly slowed the penetration of North American style processed foods.
However, there are signs of changing preferences since exotic vegetables, such as black mushrooms, lemon grass, Thai curry paste and a variety of sauces and dressings are increasingly in demand.
It should be pointed out that the many imported processed and packaged foods are tailored to suit the Indian market.
For instance, world renowned hamburger chains have altered their menus to remove beef and replace it with more acceptable meats.
Other popular North American items have seen key ingredients switched with regional spices in an attempt to accelerate their acceptance.
Packaging is also altered to meet the needs of the Indian consumer.
Most processed foods are sold in small containers due to customers limited purchasing power.
Imported food items that can be spotted in large retail stores in cities include ketchup, fruit juices, chocolates, biscuits, chocolate syrup, cake mixes, canned soups, pop corn, potato chips, canned fish, ice cream and canned corn.
Other processed foods in great demand include jams and jellies, table butter and ghee (melted butter), various masalas and curry powders, pickles, wheat flour, noodles, snack foods (mostly spicy Indian types) and health drinks.
Demand for specialty items such as almonds and other nuts, cakes, pastries and sweetmeats (Indian sweets made primarily from milk products and fruits) peak during the fall festive season, especially at Diwali, the Festival of Lights.
For those with low incomes, items such as refrigerators and microwaves are considered luxury goods that are available only to the wealthy.
As a result, Indians shop on a daily basis at small neighbourhood specialty shops or roadside vendors (i.e. fruits and vegetables in one shop, dairy products in another, groceries in a third and meat and fish in yet another).
Only in the past few years have Indians been exposed to self-service supermarkets.
Availability of many items, particularly fruits and vegetables, is very seasonal and people are accustomed to adjusting their diet accordingly.
Women do most of the shopping and make most of the food purchasing decisions.
However, households able to afford Western imports usually have servants who buy, clean and prepare the foods.
Inadequate provision of high quality and reasonably priced infrastructure services is a major barrier to continued growth of the economy.
Inefficiencies and shortfalls in capacity are reflected in congested roads and ports, frequent power outages and drinking water shortages.
The primary forms of travel in India are road, rail and boat.
India has the third largest road network in the world.
However, only half of its 3 million kilometers are paved.
Highways make up 2% of the overall network, but account for 40% of the total traffic.
According to the Indian government, roads carry 85% of passenger traffic and 70% of the freight traffic.
As a result, India has a large scale problem with congestion on its roads.
In transportation of goods, the country also suffers from a lack of refrigerated vehicles.
India's rail system is a vital artery throughout the country.
Roughly 26% of the network is electrified.
In the 2003-04 fiscal year, rail was responsible for moving an estimated 557 million tonnes of freight and approximately 5.1 billion passengers.
With its extensive coastline, India's exports and imports have come to rely on a system of ports.
In fiscal 2003-04, about 80% of total port traffic was in the form of dry and liquid bulk, with the remaining 20% consisting of general cargo and containers.
In total, 345 million tonnes of cargo passed through India's ports.
Chennai, Cochin, Ennore, Jawaharlal Nehru, Kandla, Kolkata, Marmagao, Mumbai, New Mangalore, Paradip, Tuticorin, and Visakhapatnam.
Distribution and Sales Channels Importers are key players in the distribution system in India.
Besides importing directly and distributing products, well established importers and distributors are responsible for ensuring that customs, quarantine and import procedures run smoothly.
When selling goods, India has both organized and unorganized sales channels.
The unorganized sector is very prevalent and consists of local shops and family-run street corner stalls that sell everything from vegetables to shoes.
Retailing is very traditional and bargaining/negotiation are common ways of shopping.
The organized retail sector is still quite small.
Chain stores only represent about 3% of the overall retail market.
Recently, foreign retailers have begun moving into the country, while department stores, supermarkets and shopping malls are being developed.
However, the current landscape of the retail sector remains extremely fragmented.
India's urban population centers are widely dispersed and nationwide distribution is very difficult.
It is important to keep in mind that due to its size and complications from inadequate infrastructure, it is often necessary to use a number of distributors located in different regions in order to implement a national distribution strategy.
For rural India in particular, there are large obstacles in distribution.
Rural regions consist of an intricate network of villages, which are often difficult to access because of poor road conditions.
India's total trade has increased significantly in recent years, reaching US$173 billion in 2004.
Imports were US$97.3 billion and exports were valued at US$75.6 billion.
India's most valuable exports include: diamonds, oil (not crude), and textile goods.
The country's largest export partners are the United States, the United Arab Emirates, China, Singapore and the UK.
The most significant import commodities include: crude oil, gold (unworked or semi-manufactured), and diamonds.
India's largest international suppliers are China, the United States, Switzerland, Belgium, and the United Arab Emirates.
Exports to India from Canada averaged a 16.5% annual growth rate between 2000 to 2004, reaching a total of US$681 million.
Imports from India grew at 12.8%, on a yearly basis for the same period, reaching US$1.2 billion.
Investment India's economic policies are designed to attract significant capital inflows into India on a sustained basis and to encourage technology sharing between Indian and foreign firms.
Policy initiatives taken over the last few years have resulted in significant inflows of foreign investment in all areas of the economy, except those reserved for the public sector.
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted through the following forms of investment:
• Financial collaborations
• Joint ventures and technical collaborations
• Capital markets via Euro issues
• Arms and ammunitions
• Atomic Energy
• Railway Transport
• Coal and lignite
• Mining of iron, manganese, chrome, gypsum, sulphur, gold, diamonds, copper and zinc.
Trade Agreements India is an active member of the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
A SAARC-ASEAN-APEC link assists in trade creation and policy coordination among regional blocks while negotiating under the WTO.
SAARC also developed the South Asian Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA), which established a framework to exchange trade concessions among member countries.
This led to a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA), which will come into effect in January 2006.
India also participates as a member of the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IOR-ARC).
Furthermore, the country is a part of the Bangladesh, India, Burma, Sri Lanka and Thailand Economic Cooperation group (BIMST-EC).
The Indian government has preferential and/or free trade treaties with Nepal and Sri-Lanka, Afghanistan, Maldives, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Thailand, as well.
Additionally, Singapore and India have recently entered into a free trade agreement, which was signed on June 29, 2005.
Currently, India is involved in talks with China, Brazil and South Africa for the purpose of establishing bi-lateral agreements for promoting trade and investment.
& Import Duties Traditionally, India has maintained high tariffs and other import restrictions on food items.
However, some commodities such as pulses are more easily imported since tariffs are relatively lower and regulations are less stringent.
These are: the "basic customs duty", the "surcharge", the "additional duty of customs", and the "special additional duty."
The basic customs duty can be a percentage rate (ad valorem rate) applied to the value of the goods (valued at Cost, Insurance and Freight (C.I.F)) or a specific rate based on unit of measurement.
This duty is commodity specific, so different rates of duty apply for different products.
For agriculture and food products, the basic customs duty can be as high as 100%.
The surcharge is levied at a rate of 10% of the basic customs duty.
The additional duty of customs, or "countervailing duty," is equal to the excise duty applied on like goods produced/manufactured domestically in India.
These excise duties can be as high as 24%, depending on the product.
Furthermore, this duty is applied on the total value of the goods, calculated as the value at C.I.F. plus the basic customs duty.
Lastly, the special additional duty is a rate that differs by product and is levied on the total value of goods, computed as the value at C.I.F, along with the basic customs duty and the additional duty of customs.
Aside from the four duties described previously, additional levies such as antidumping duties, safeguard duties etc. may also be applied.
However, under certain conditions and depending on the type of goods imported, exemptions may be available.
Relative to the rest of the world, India is a very significant player in the agriculture sector.
According to statistics provided by the Indian government's Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, the country ranks second in the world after the US in terms of arable land.
It also has more irrigated area than any other country.
India is largely self-sufficient in the production of food and is among the top 10 international producers of a vast array of agricultural commodities.
It is the world's number one producer of pulses, tea, jute, and milk.
In addition, it has the largest cattle and buffalo herd.
Overall, India ranks third in the world in cereal grain production (ranked second in the world in wheat and rice production), has the world's largest livestock population and is among the top 5 producers of various fruits, vegetables and oilseeds.
Among the country's major products sold abroad are: rice, soybean meal, cashews, wheat and tea.
Imports of agriculture and food products into India in 2004 grew by 7.5%, reaching US$4.9 billion.
Approximately, 50% of these imports were edible oils, most notably palm and soybean oil.
Overall, India experienced a trade surplus in agriculture and food products in 2004 of about US$2.5 billion, a 124% increase from 2003.
Despite the fact that India is among the world's largest producers of oilseeds, edible vegetable oils dominate all imports.
Demand for edible vegetable oils has risen rapidly as incomes increase.
In contrast, oilseed production has stagnated due to an inability to increase yields and high tariffs have hindered imports.
This situation has left India's crushing and oil refining industry with large amounts of idle capacity (utilization rate is estimated at only 35%) and the country with a burgeoning supply deficit in edible oils, which is balanced off with imports.
Currently, India is the largest importer of edible oils in the world.
A similar situation exists with pulses.
Despite India's status as the world's largest producer, India is still a net importer.
This is because pulses are an important source of protein and local production has failed to keep pace with population growth and rising demand from increasing incomes.
An additional note of interest is that although much of India sees cattle as sacred animals, cattle slaughter occurs in the states of Kerala and West Bengal.
Slaughter is usually restricted to older cattle and is illegal in all other states.
This practice is extremely controversial and there have been government proposals to completely ban it.
Currently, the political debate over this matter continues and it seems that a decision will not be made in the near future.
Turning to other aspects of the supply chain, traditionally there has not been much value-added production in India.
However, demand for processed food is increasing with rising incomes and changing tastes.
From 1999 to 2004 retail sales volume of dried processed food (e.g. rice, dried pasta, noodles etc.) grew by 72%.
Of these sales, branded rice accounted for approximately 55% in 2004.
Markets for high-value dairy products such as skimmed milk powder, whole milk powder, butter oil, whey powder, lactose and energy and health products, such as vitamin-enriched yogurts, are also growing.
Despite India's economic success over the last few years, agricultural trade between India and Canada has experienced only moderate growth.
For the 1999 to 2004 period, Canadian exports have fluctuated, reaching a peak in 2001 of US$136 million.
However, there was a decrease from that point, with exports reaching US$85.9 million in 2004.
Overall, the trend in exports from 1999 to 2004 has been increasing, with an average annual growth rate of roughly 8%.
Over the same period, Canada's imports from India decreased to a low of US$60.3 million in 2001 and subsequently increased, reaching US$90.3 million in 2004.
The most significant agricultural exports to India are: dried peas, chickpeas, lentils and mustard seed.
These four commodities make up approximately 97% of the total.
The largest agricultural imports from India into Canada are: rice, cashews, raw shelled peanuts and sesame seeds.
Import Competitors and Opportunities As identified previously, Canada's agricultural exports to India consist almost entirely of pulses.
Overall, Canada is a major supplier of these products to India, but there are many competitors.
For dried peas, Canada is the top supplier, but Australia and France are major exporters as well.
The largest suppliers for chickpeas are Iran, Turkey and Australia.
Aside from Canada, Nepal and China play a major role in India's lentil imports and there is also competition from Belgium and Germany in the mustard seed market.
In addition to the growing pulse markets, there maybe potential in oilseeds.
Currently, imports of oilseeds into India face high tariffs.
However, the strong demand for edible oils and idle oil production capacity in the country has led to India's Minister of Agriculture to speak publicly about importing oilseeds in the future.
Canada's participation in India's agriculture and agri-food sector is not limited to livestock and crops.
Export opportunities also exist in a range of related agri-business activities which include:
• Agribusiness covering- Agriculture, horticulture, fisheries, dairy, poultry- post harvest technology, cold storage infrastructure, bulk storage, handling and transportation of grain and other produce
• Biotechnology: in agriculture, horticulture, processing, research and development
Market Constraints Some of the general market constraints that Canadian exporters encounter when entering India are distance, poor infrastructure and a large vegetarian population.
More specifically, some of the challenges that need to be overcome are:
• Competition from suppliers with more advantageous geographic proximity, such as Australia
• Diverse agro-industrial base offering many products at very competitive prices
• Preference for fresh products and traditional foods
• Difficulties in accessing the vast untapped rural markets
• Inadequate infrastructure (e.g. ports, roads, electricity, cold storage)
• Stringent food regulations and high tariffs
Canada's Exports to India Exports of chickpeas represented 5.1% of Canada's agricultural exports to India in 2004, with a total export value of $12 million.
Exports of lentils represented 3.5% of Canada's agricultural exports to India in 2004, with a total export value of $4 million.
Exports of mustard seeds represented 1.2% of Canada's agricultural exports to India in 2004, with a total export value of $1.3 million.

The launch coincided with the visit of former Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister Lyle Vanclief who visited India to promote farm cooperation and seek India's support in WTO agriculture negotiations.
Glenn Stansfield, President and CEO of Niagara Enterprise Agency, stated, "India's growing middle-class population is becoming more affluent and western-oriented through education and the increased globalization of the nation's economy.
This, combined with the increasing restaurant culture, could make icewine a drink of choice."
The NEA represents six major wineries in the Niagara region.
Icewine is made of Vidal and Riesling grapes that are hand-picked after three consecutive days with temperatures of minus 10 degrees Celsius.
The Indian wine market has been growing at 20 to 30% in the past few years.
With changing social norms and living standards, an increasing number of Indians who previously chose not to consume alcoholic beverages now enjoy wine in social settings.
While India has been one of Canada's key markets for peas and pulses, it is fast emerging as an attractive destination for exports of confectionary items, snack and breakfast foods, dairy products and select fruits and vegetables.

Market Information Asia Pacific The Retail Food Market in the Kansai Region of Japan
1) ISSUE Chain store operators in Japan are currently facing huge changes in their business environment.
Foreign supermarket giants such as Carrefour, Costco, Wal-Mart, and Tesco have entered the Japanese market, and food distribution channels are changing rapidly.
Some regional chain stores are going to extraordinary lengths to differentiate themselves from the competition.
In particular, they are looking to directly source imported processed foods.
2) DESCRIPTION Today, Canada is the fourth largest exporter of food products to the Kansai region with an import market share of 5.9 percent.
Canada's share in total Japanese food imports was 4.52% in 2003.
Canadian food exports to Japan have met with varying degrees of success.
For example, Canada's processed wheat products hold the third position in Japan's processed wheat products market; its alcoholic beverages hold eighth position overall; and coffee and tea products hold a distant 48th position.
In the late 1980s, there was a boom of direct food importation by Japanese supermarket chain operators.
However, supermarkets faced problems such as inventory control when importing food directly, and, consequently, many of them withdrew from direct import operations.
Recently, many retail chain stores in Japan have either begun practicing, or are considering practicing, direct importing from foreign food producers due to a number of contributing factors.
These include: the market entry of foreign chain store operators, changes to distribution channels, an increase in consumer knowledge of imported foods, a desire to raise the profile of their specialty chains in comparison with the competition, and the substantial buying power of Japanese consumers.
Market entry by foreign operators Recent market infiltration by foreign companies has facilitated common customer access to imported processed foods.
In 2000, the French supermarket Carrefour opened its first Japan store in a suburb city of Metropolitan Tokyo.
Costco Wholesale Club opened its second Japan store that same year, right next door to this Carrefour.
Carrefour currently has seven stores in Japan, four of which are in the Kansai region, and Costco has four stores, one of which is also located in the Kansai region.
In July 2003, it was reported that the United Kingdom supermarket giant Tesco PLC had launched a tender offer to purchase shares of C Two-Network Co.
Furthermore, the world's largest retail store chain, U.S. based Wal-Mart, has entered the Japanese market by becoming a major share holder of Seiyu Co., Ltd (Japan's third largest supermarket chain with 32 Seiyu stores in the Kansai) and by introducing Wal-Mart's world famous supply system to Japan.
Some of the existing Seiyu Stores have already shifted to Wal-Mart's operating procedures, with the rest to follow.
Because of this recent entry by foreign competitors, Japanese retailers need to become more competitive and attractive to general consumers.
Large Japanese chain operators such as AEON (Jusco) and Ito Yokado compete directly with these foreign giants.
AEON, Asia's second largest retailing group, is aggressively acquiring regional supermarkets to form a larger supermarket group.
It bailed out Mycal for example, which went into receivership in September 2001 with an outstanding debt of $ 20.9 billion.
Mycal's failure was the largest ever corporate bond default in Japan.
On October 1, 2003, Mycal became a full-fledged subsidiary of AEON.
As a result, AEON became the largest retail chain operator in Japan, with 77 stores in the Kansai region alone.
Regional chain store operators want to, and must, differentiate themselves from these giant retailers.
Some are focusing on fresh food sales such as meat, seafood, and vegetables to establish close ties with the local community.
Others are trying to increase the stature of their store brand by carrying a wide variety of imported processed food B in many cases through direct import operations.
It is these companies that provide an excellent opportunity for Canadian suppliers.
Food wholesalers still play an important role in the Japanese food distribution channel.
Although a few big Japanese supermarket chains such as AEON (Jusco) are trying to introduce direct buying operations with domestic food manufacturers, most Japanese retail food chain store operators still rely on the information and logistical network of wholesalers for product sourcing.
This might be the most significant difference in the food distribution channel between Japan and North America, including Canada.
Historically speaking, the Japanese food wholesale sector is divided by product category.
Most of the large nation-wide food wholesalers in Japan started as processed food wholesalers.
However, to serve their customers more efficiently, wholesalers are in the process of expanding through mergers, acquisitions, and strategic alliances to include items other than the usual processed foods, such as liquor, and frozen and chilled foods.
On the other hand, smaller wholesalers are not able to survive alone due to changes in the business environment such as the deregulation of liquor sales.
In 2000, the seventh largest wholesaler Sanyu Co., Ltd and the ninth largest wholesaler Koami Co., Ltd merged into Sanyu-Koami Co., Ltd to become the fifth largest food wholesaler in Japan.
As of April 1, 2004, Sanyu-Koami Co.
In March 2003, Kokubu Corporation, Japan's largest food wholesaler, gained 43.1 percent of Tokyo's Hiroya Co., Ltd shares.
Hiroya is a well established liquor wholesaler dating back more than 287 years.
A few months later, in September 2003, Saihara Co., Ltd, one of the leading food wholesalers in Osaka for the last 80 years, was taken over by Japan's second largest wholesaler, Ryoshoku Co., Ltd.
As a result, Saihara became a complete subsidiary of Ryoshoku.
Following these trends in the Japanese wholesaling industry, large wholesalers are growing in size, and the total number of wholesalers is shrinking rapidly.
According to the most radical forecasts from industry insiders, only seven nation-wide wholesalers in Japan will survive the decade.
As the number of wholesalers shrinks, there will be fewer sources of product purchasing for Japanese retailers.
In a situation in which more than 1,000 retail chain operators rely on less than 10 wholesalers for product sourcing, it will be extremely difficult for stores to differentiate themselves by their products alone.
Thus, importing directly from foreign food manufacturers and suppliers is looking more and more attractive to regional chains.
An increase in consumer knowledge In today's Internet age, general consumers, particularly Ainnovative@ consumers, have an excellent tool with which to look for nutritional, diet, and food information.
In addition, Japanese consumers have a deep knowledge of imported food products.
They not only gain information through the Internet, but also are frequent overseas travelers.
These types of consumers often ask for their favourite imported products at regional retail stores.
Raise the profile of stores Generally speaking, there is a wide variety of imported processed foods on store shelves in high-end Japanese supermarkets or department stores.
Some famous food brands, such as Walkers Shortbread, enjoy high brand recognition even among general consumers.
For store operators that decide to compete with national chain stores, carrying a wide variety of quality imported processed foods is a must.
It is possible to source these products from existing importers or wholesalers in Japan, but direct importing from foreign suppliers helps chains to carry and market their own uniquely chosen products.
Buying power of Japanese consumers Japanese consumers equate price with quality, and are often sceptical of cheap, large-volume products.
At the same time, people are cutting back on spending and are becoming increasingly price-sensitive.
Discount stores and one-coin shops (100 Yen Shops) are gaining in popularity.
Japanese consumers are price-sensitive when buying daily commodities, yet tend to spend more freely on premium or brand-name products.
Quality, not quantity, (as many foreign firms such as Wal-Mart quickly discovered) is one extremely critical aspect of Japanese consumerism and marketing.
Quality applies equally and strictly to food and beverage products.
If a product has excellent quality, is nicely packaged, and of course tastes good, people are not reluctant to pay a premium.
In FY2002, the average Japanese household spent nearly $10,000 on food products.
Almost half of this amount, $4,907, was spent on processed food products alone.
Interestingly, $790 was spent on sweets such as cakes and candies.
The average household also spent around $2,183 eating out in 2002, or approximately $182/month.
Non-alcoholic beverage products and alcoholic drink expenditures accounted for around $500/year respectively.
Clearly, Japanese consumers are willing to commit a large portion of their income towards quality food and beverage products.
3) IMPACT ON CANADIAN COMPANIES Despite some recent moves towards simplification, the Japanese food distribution system remains complex and multi-layered.
Canadian food exporters who have good products for the Japanese retail market will find market entry easier through retail chain stores that are importing directly.
All chain stores that import directly, without exception, have concerns regarding the volume of purchasing lots.
When placing an order with foreign exporters for example, sometimes the order volume does not meet the minimum order of the exporters.
Chain store operators have indicated that this is particularly the case when dealing with exporters in the United States, rather than Europe or Asia.
The minimum order set by U.S. exporters is usually too large for medium-sized retail store chains, which prefer small lot orders repeated on a regular basis in order to reduce the concern of dead stock.
Competitive Canadian exporters who are flexible in this respect will find great opportunity in Japan's processed food retail market.

APPENDIX This appendix includes brief company information on retailers in the Kansai region who are directly importing processed foods or are actively promoting imported processed foods despite the fact that they may not yet be involved in direct import operations.
It markets itself as a AShowcase of processed import foods in the Kansai@ and carries a wide variety of imported processed foods on their store shelves, imported both directly and indirectly.
Ikari Supermarket, and their 100 percent-owned trading companies Inabco Trading, has been involved in the direct importation of processed foods for more than 20 years.
Although they also carry imported processed foods sourced from existing Japanese importers, their corporate strategy is to expand their array of imported items as much as possible.
As of 2003, Ikari imports the following products directly:
• Frozen grapefruit juice (US)
• Fresh grapes, grapefruit, and oranges (US)
• Snack foods (US)
• Blended black tea leaves (UK)
• Frozen bread dough (France)
• Candies (France)
• Cheese (France)
• Foi gras (France)
• Wine (France, Italy, Argentine, Uruguay, Spain, Australia)
• Pasta and pasta sauce (Italy)
• Olive oil (Italy)
• Processed tomatoes (Italy)
• Vinegar (Italy)
• Jam and honey (Austria)
• Nuts (Thailand) Tokuoka Co., Ltd.
(Direct Importer) Strictly speaking, Tokuoka Co., Ltd is not categorized as a supermarket operator because they carry only processed foods and beverages, with no fresh produce.
The business began as a liquor wholesaler in the 19th century and expanded to the retail sector, after their incorporation in 1971, with the establishment of a discount liquor shop chain.
As of 2003, they have 20 stores in the Kansai region.
Around 40% of Tokuoka's sales come from wholesaling and 60% from retailing.
Due to their history as a liquor wholesaler, the majority of Tokuoka's retail sales come from alcohol products: 30% from beer and 25% from wine.
However, their current business plan focuses on raising their sales of imported processed foods.
As of 2003, Tokuoka imports the following products directly:
• Bottled mineral water (France, Italy)
• Fruit juice (Germany)
• Pasta (Italy)
• Sparkling soft drinks (US)
• Canned tomatoes (Italy)
• Frozen vegetables (China)
(Direct importer) KOHYO Co., Ltd. is another medium-sized regional supermarket chain in the Kansai region, with 21 outlets as of 2003.
They started as a fresh seafood retail shop chain, and sales of fresh foods such as fish, meat, and vegetables continue to occupy some 50 percent of their total sales.
Despite this history, their stores are mainly located in downtown areas where there is fierce competition with other supermarkets.
To differentiate themselves, they began to carry imported processed foods, mainly from Europe.
Initially, they sourced Japanese importers, but they recently began to import directly, starting with wine from France.
KOHYO plans to expand its directly imported items, in particular processed foods rather than fresh products.
Their downtown Osaka stores have become quite famous among consumers for their wide variety of imported processed foods.
At this moment, Ace is sourcing products from Japanese importers and/or wholesalers but intends to begin importing food directly in the near future.
Some of Daikin's stores are high-end supermarkets with a wide variety of imported processed food products supplied by Japanese importers and/or wholesalers.
The most unique aspect of Daikin is that they also manufacture food products themselves, such as tofu, noodles, ham, and sausages.
Although they do not intend to start importing finished processed foods directly at this moment, they may purchase raw materials for use in food production at their own factory.

Agri-Food Past, Present & Future Report China December 2006
China Country Report:
China Past Present & Future Report December 2006 Overview China, the largest nation and one of the fastest growing economies in the world, presents tremendous opportunity for Canadian agri-food exporters.
China’s extensive economic, political and social restructuring in recent years has allowed the country to see extraordinary growth which has fostered rising consumer wealth and disposable incomes.
With over 25% of the population now considered middle-class consumers, and an estimated 810 million expected to enter this consumer segment by 2025, China’s middle-class consumers represent an extremely lucrative market for Canadian agrifood products.
Therefore, effectively marketing and positioning Canadian goods will be paramount in attracting what will become the largest and most profitable consumer segment in the Chinese marketplace.
Canada – China Relations Canada and China maintain excellent bilateral relations.
Canada offered political support throughout World War II, has provided monetary aid since 1981, and enjoys a strengthening trade relationship with the country.
The nations first established diplomatic relations in 1970 and continue to maintain high-ranking official visits to each other’s states every year.
The countries currently share trade, development, educational, and cultural partnerships.
Canada has invested more than $7.7 billion in China since 1990, or 1.5% of total foreign direct investment (FDI) in the country.
Canada and China’s trade relationship is the cornerstone of successful long-term relations and Canada’s role in fostering China’s entry into global political and economic organizations, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Canada was a strong supporter of China’s recent entry into the WTO and continues to assist China with its transition to a market-based economy, through core strategies that include economic restructuring, improving infrastructure, and implementing transparent regulations and legislation.
This relationship will prove to be extremely important in further strengthening the nations’ trade relationship, particularly in fostering future growth in agricultural and agri-food commerce.
The magnitude of the countries’ bilateral relationship is further illustrated below through trade figures:
Canada-China bilateral trade totalled over $36 billion in 2005.
This value increased by 18.5% from its 2004 total of $30.8 billion.
Top Canadian exports to China include organic chemicals (13.2%), wood pulp (11.6%), and non-metallic minerals (6.6%).
Canadian agri-food exports to China have also steadily increased over the past several years with intermediate and bulk goods consistently representing the majority of exports.
Such goods comprised almost all Canadian agri-food exports to China at 89% in 2005.
Mushrooms and mandarins have remained Canada’s top import commodities from China over the past decade and typically account for approximately 10% and 7% of total agri-food imports from China respectively.
China Country Report:
Total Canada/China agricultural trade represents approximately 3.3% or $1.2 billion of all trade between the two countries.
Canola and colza oil, and bovine hides accounted for roughly $90.6 million and $75 million respectively, or 10% and 8% of exports.
Major fish and seafood exports to China in 2005 included shrimp and prawns at over $73 million and making up 23% of total exports, snow crabs valued at $67 million and 21% of total exports, and crabs totalling more than $31 million or 10% of exports.
Mackerel and Greenland halibut accounted for $23 million and $13 million respectively, or 7% and 4% of exports.
2005 bulk exports to China totalled $517 million, decreasing by $391,000 from 2004, while intermediate exports totalled $281.5 million and showed modest 7% growth from 2004.
Consumer oriented exports were valued at $94 million in 2005, a $28.4 million or 43% jump from 2004.
As a result, the increasing prevalence of privatization and implementation of new commercial laws, in addition to the market having seen a huge influx of FDI, has extensively liberalized the economy.
WTO accession will have a large impact on foreign investment and trade, further relaxing many of the regulations and market access issues foreign companies historically faced.
These reforms have made China one of the world’s fastest growing economies, with a GDP growth estimate of 10.5% for 2006.
Economic developments, easing trade and FDI laws, and a large, low-cost labour market have transformed China into a very attractive trade and investment partner.
In 2002, China was the largest FDI recipient in the world, surpassing the United States with over US$52.7 billion in investment.
Chinese officials expect that the country will receive more than US$100 billion in FDI each year between 2006 and 2010.
Today’s Group of Eight economies combined only produce half of this value.
Current economic trends:
• GDP reached a value of US$2.2 trillion in 2005 and is forecast to reach over US$2.4 GDP US$2.2 trillion trillion in 2006.
• Inflation slightly increased to 1.9% in GDP growth (2005) 9.9% (2006) 10.5% 2005 from 2004’s approximate year-end total of 1.1%.
• Since 1978, the Chinese government has (PPP) gradually privatized its state-owned industries and companies.
The private sector currently accounts for two-thirds of China’s GDP.
Forecasted economic trends:
• GDP growth reached 9.9% in 2005, fuelled by business investment and a boom in the service sector.
GDP is expected to slow to 9.6% in 2007, from 10.5% in 2006, as the government attempts to reduce China’s reliance on imports and foreign investment, and focus its efforts on increasing consumer spending.
GDP growth of 9.3% is forecast for 2008.
• Chinese exports and imports are expected to reach US$960 billion and US$810 billion respectively in 2006.
This will create a US$150 billion trade surplus, an approximate 50% increase over the 2005 value of US$102 billion.
• General price levels are expected to remain constant at 1.8% in 2006, and decrease to 1.0% in 2007.
Consumer Market Urban vs. Rural Consumers Previously, China’s elite and a small percentage of upper middle-class consumers were wealthy enough to purchase international and Western-style food products.
In fact, nearly 50% of all Chinese households in urban areas are considered middle-class.
This population is projected to reach 40% by 2020, up from 19% in 2003, if current growth trends continue.
Average urban Chinese living supports the ability to allocate considerable amounts of disposable income to imported and domestic consumer goods and services.
Currently 80% of urban homes have refrigerators and washing machines, 50% own air conditioners and DVD players, and a 20% have computers.
Furthermore, automobile sales are rising by 40% per year.
China’s southeastern and coastal regions are typically more urbanized than western and rural parts of the country, due to their proximity to ports and easier accessibility for foreign companies.
To view a breakdown of GDP per capita by province and the economic development differences of urbanized and rural regions in China visit the China Facts page of www.shanghaienglishteachers.com. Nearly 65% of China’s population resided in rural locations in 2005, a figure that is expected to decrease by 16 points to reach its forecasted 2015 value of 56%.
As China’s urbanization increases, its overall prosperity is expected to rise accordingly.
Industry analysts have stated that an urbanization rate of 40-50% lends to more rapid urban growth, and only begins to slow when a nation is 70% urbanized.
China is believed to have reached the 42% urbanization mark in 2005, and is well on track to attain 50% between 2010 and 2015, and 60% by 2030.
By 2010 China’s urban population is expected to be between 650 and 700 million, at least 2.4 times larger than that of the United States and 1.7 times larger than India’s.
Such developments will have a dramatic affect on consumers’ purchasing power and taste for more sophisticated Western products and services in certain high-growth cities.
This change could further boost Chinese consumption of Canadian agri-food products as Western foods, particularly health, natural, organic, and convenience foods, have become popular staples in many urban Chinese diets.
Attractive Geographic Markets The following cities are expected high growth areas that will hold great opportunity for Canadian exporters looking to enter the Chinese market:
Northeast Region
• Quingdao, Shandong province Quingdao, home to 7 million, is regarded as one of China’s most prosperous cities and ranked first in the country for quality of life in 2004.
The city’s retail food sector has grown considerably in recent years with the addition of many hypermarkets and
• Dalian, Liaoning province Dalian’s coastal location makes it a prime gateway to Northeast China.
The port city is trade-oriented, has a solid infrastructure and sees heavy investment from Japan and Korea.
Dalian residents hold high disposable incomes and generally consider American food to be equal or better quality than other imports, signifying opportunities for Canadian agri-food products.
The city has recently seen a rise in the number of hypermarkets and supermarkets, with many such outlets incorporating fresh, frozen, and prepared foods and food service stations. o Dalian-based retail food chain, Dashang, reported the second highest sales volume in all of China in 2003, outpacing large foreign-owned multinationals such as Carrefour and Wal-Mart.
Dalian is recognized for high consumer spending.
Southwest Interior Region
• Chengdu, Sichaun province Chengdu is regarded as one of the most affluent cities in the western region of China.
Home to more than 10.5 million Chinese and a GDP of US$26 billion, Chengdu is often referred to as "China’s breadbasket" due to its significant agricultural output.
Chengdu acts as the main transportation centre for the region, due to its prime location between West and Southeast China, as well as its new highways and airport.
China’s famous Sichaun cuisine originates from the city and has contributed to making food an important part of local culture.
However, imported foods have not penetrated the market to the same degree as in other cities and many distributors are unaware of foreign products. o Due to Chengdu’s deep location in the interior of China, exporting goods to the region can be challenging as distribution networks remain limited and/or underdeveloped between the city and other provinces.
Consumer Incomes Many wealthy middle- and upper-class consumers are found in well-developed or rapidly developing cities and share a number of similar characteristics.
Although China’s average gross income per capita in 2005 was $995, high-income earners in large urban centres like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou can make as much as $2,900 per month and see more than three times the annual average gross per capita income.
In comparison, well-off residents of emerging cities, such as Chengdu, are likely to earn an average monthly income of $420 to $550.
Disposable income accounts for approximately 83% of gross profit and is usually allocated toward the purchase of houses, cars, digital products and tailored personal services among members of the proposed urban target market.
Expenditure on soft products such as financial services, concerts, sports centres and travel is also on the rise.
This trend is likely to continue as disposable income is expected to reach more than 87% of gross income by 2015.
Lucrative Consumer Segments With the rising affluence of Chinese and a burgeoning middle-class, five key consumer segments stand out as potentially lucrative markets for Canadian agri-food exporters to target:
• Middle-Aged, Middle-Class Adults Middle-aged consumers (i.e. between the ages of 30 and 59) comprise over 45% of the Chinese population, a large part of the middle-class and most of the public’s elite.
Among this consumer segment are a number of professionals including engineers, scholars, doctors, scientists and business people, many of who are becoming increasingly successful at younger ages.
This segment is currently increasing demand for sophisticated Western products and services which constitute a large part of their expenditure, presenting considerable opportunities for Canadian exports.
Foreign-educated Chinese bring home knowledge and taste for international goods and are becoming a very influential subgroup.
However, price sensitivity remains a key issue that exporters need to consider when positioning products for this consumer segment.
therefore have to carefully position their products to specific teenage segments of the Chinese market.
• Empty Nesters China’s empty nester segment accounted for nearly 12% of households in 2005, and is expected to increase to 13.4% of the population by 2015; an approximate 59 million families.
A large portion of empty nesters are also dual income families and are usually found amongst high income and well-educated consumer groups.
This segment can afford to spend a lot on luxury products, travel, sports and dining out.
Healthy food products, ready-made meals, and portable foods are likely to be popular within this group.
High-Income Families The number of high-income families in China is rapidly increasing.
Such consumers hold high-income jobs and prefer modern living communities; therefore, they are likely to be concentrated in highly urbanized regions and wealthy cities.
High-income families lead expensive lifestyles and spend a lot of their incomes on sports and travel.
Premium Canadian agri-food products, as well as natural, organic and healthy convenience foods could show considerable success within this market segment.
Such Chinese are typically well educated, own a home and car, and spend a large part of their disposable income on luxury products.
Natural, organic and premium Canadian agri-food products will probably show the most success amongst this consumer group.
With increased awareness about the benefits of nutritious eating, the popularity of organic and health foods is rising in China.
The Chinese population is increasingly working longer hours, leading busier lifestyles and earning larger disposable incomes (although increases in wealth and income are highly limited to southern and eastern coastal urban areas and surrounding regions).
As a result, consumer demand for packaged, processed, ready-to-eat and takeaway foods is also greatly increasing, particularly demand for fast noodles and rice which is very common in urban areas.
However, processed foods have not yet become widely popular among Chinese due to food safety problems that have plagued the industry in the past.
New food processing safety regulations are expected to improve the sector’s performance in the future.
As is the case in many countries, traditional eating habits are modified as cultural and social changes surface.
With China having seen an influx of Western-style fast food chains and products (bolstered by Western lifestyles shown through media) consumers have trended toward purchasing more meals from such outlets and moving away from eating traditional Chinese dishes.
However, further distribution of health information through media and educational programs should help increase awareness of healthy eating and counteract this negative trend.
In turn, demand for healthy and organic foods may rise, presenting more opportunities for Canadian agri-food exporters.
Consumer expenditure totalled $869 billion in 2005, and is expected to rise approximately 28% to reach $1.1 trillion by 2015.
Recent increases in consumer disposable income, fuelled by rapid economic growth, have allowed Chinese to purchase food that they previously could not afford.
Meat consumption, particularly beef, mutton, pork and chicken, has risen in recent years, as well as that of natural and organic foods.
• China consumes 51% of the world’s pork, 33% of rice, 19% of ice cream, 19% of poultry, and 12% of beef.
As one of the largest consumer markets in the world, China annually consumes 8.5 million tons of meat, 40 million tons of vegetables and over 12.5 million tons of fruit.
• Approximately 29% of overall household expenditure is allocated to the purchase of food and non-alcoholic beverages, while that of urban consumers is closer to 38%.
This number has been decreasing over the past several years although consumers are on average spending more on such goods in terms of dollar value, a trend which illustrates the rise in the Chinese standard of living.
• 61% of total food expenditure in urban areas goes toward food for consumption outside of the home.
• In 2005, consumers spent $251 billion on food and non-alcoholic beverages.
This value is expected to increase by 31% to reach $328.8 billion by 2015.
• As Chinese increasingly lead busier lifestyles, the demand for safe processed foods and convenience products, as well as healthy and organic foods is rising.
Fast growing commodities include healthy snack foods (e.g. nuts, dried fruit); fresh fruit (e.g. apples, cherries, oranges, pears); seafood, poultry and red meat; frozen vegetables, especially sweet corn and potato products; dairy products, especially ice cream; Mexican food; functional, ready-to-cook and – eat foods; and baby food and instant formula.
• Processed foods are more popular in urban areas as poor logistics and infrastructure make it difficult for exporters and distributors to reach consumers in rural areas.
Rural consumers therefore prefer fresh foods due to price and availability.
• Due to the vast size of China’s emerging middle class and the expenditure and attention it will command over the next decade, Canadian agri-food exporters may want to include this target market in their market-entry strategy and/or focus their entire plan on this consumer segment.
Staples
• Rice, meat, fish and vegetables are staples of the Chinese diet.
Consumers living in northern regions of China typically consume more flour-based products than their counterparts in southern areas of the country.
Potatoes and sweet potatoes are also commonly found in Chinese meals, with annual consumption averaging 83 lb. and 80 lb. per capita respectively.
With a push for healthier foods, Chinese consumption of vegetables has greatly increased in recent years.
Between 2000 and 2005, per capita consumption of vegetables rose by almost 23% to reach 385 lb. per capita.
Green vegetables remain the most consumed fresh foods in China.
Fruit consumption in general, especially citrus fruit due to its vitamin C properties, increased about 31% between 2000 and 2005 as it is considered a healthy way to manage weight gain.
Consumer brand-recognition and demand for variety and quality is increasing; however, product price still remains a major factor in influencing purchasing decisions.
This may therefore, have some impact on the sale of imported premium goods, organic products and high-quality fresh foods.
Consumption of soft drinks increased by 106% between 2000 and 2005.
Even more impressive was ready-to-drink (RTD) tea, which more than doubled with a 239% increase over the five-year period to 4.3 L per capita consumption.
Growth in Asian specialty drinks followed at 179% and 4.2 L per capita, fruit and vegetable juice at 165% and 3.4 L per capita, and bottled water with a 126% increase and 8.6 L per capita consumption.
This trend is directly influenced by a desire for healthier eating among Chinese consumers.
Alcoholic beverage consumption has risen in recent years, mainly due to increases in consumer disposable incomes, and is mostly enjoyed during meals among wealthy Chinese.
Beer, white spirits and wine are the most frequently consumed alcoholic beverages; however, Chinese spirits are generally preferred over imported brands due to differences in price and taste.
Key opportunities within China’s food and beverage market include convenience and processed food products, health foods and snacks, organic foods, and fish and seafood.
The organic food market remains quite small in China in comparison to those of other nations.
However, while organic foods only comprise 1% of the total food sector, given the size of the market this value remains considerable.
• Retail food sales reached $674 billion in 2004, an approximate 18% increase over the 2003 total of $571 million.
• The Chinese middle class is quickly growing as evidenced by the development of large multi-product stores and shopping centres that service large middle class concentrations within the country.
Metro, RT Mart, Trust-Mart, Parkson’s, CRC/Vangyard, E-Mart, Lotus, 7Eleven, Family Mart, C-Store and Lawson’s; however, imports only make up 4% of inventory in such outlets.
Due to the small presence of imported foods in the Chinese marketplace, instore demonstrations, samples and promotions are recommended to stimulate trial and repeat purchases.
Many Chinese are still very price sensitive and highly influenced by bargains and salespersons’ suggestions, often resulting in last minute changes to their purchases.
China’s principal agri-food import sources, the United States (24.8%), Australia (9.2%), Brazil (11.6%), Argentina (11.6%) and Malaysia (5.1%), represent Canada’s top competition in the Chinese export market.
Furthermore, China’s CEPA with Hong Kong and Macao also influences how numerous exports enter the country, as this relationship facilitates product admission via Guangdong province much easier than in the past.
Domestic food producers and processors also present considerable competition for Canadian agri-food exporters, as almost all Chinese supermarket and hypermarket chains only contain home-grown goods.
Foreign-owned retail food chains may present the best market entry, distribution and product placement opportunities for Canadian exports; however, such goods currently only represent 4% of total food product sales in such outlets.
Retailers site low purchasing levels of international goods in comparison to well-known Chinese products as the reason for limited shelfspace designated for foreign products.
Since its accession into the WTO, China’s range of trade and investment opportunities has grown, making for numerous economic changes.
Major changes include permitting foreign wholly owned companies in the country, and more international participation in distribution, logistics, telecommunication, finance, and professional services, which are expected to benefit foreign exporters.
Access Issues China remains a country of constant trade and investment interest for Canadian and foreign investors, and holds strong potential for Canadian companies wanting to penetrate the Asian market.
To facilitate successful market entry, Canadian exporters are encouraged to develop market entry strategies that include working with local importers and distributors to develop a presence, gain valuable market advice, and best position products to meet local tastes, laws and pricing.
China is member of the UN, APEC and WTO, and implements international accords and policies from these bodies.
The majority of China’s requirements governing
imports are co-ordinated with WTO regulations, while others are specific to the country.
Canadian exporters should confirm that their Chinese importer has the appropriate licence to do so.
This can be done by contacting China’s State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC) as all companies must register with the department and business licences are made available for public viewing.
Wool, tobacco and tobacco products, cotton, grains, sugar, vegetable oil, and carbonated and alcoholic beverages are subject to import quotas and require an import licence.
China Customs typically levies a 17% Value Added Tax (VAT) on imported goods; however, tariffs vary depending on the category certain imports belong to.
Although many tariffs were lowered with WTO accession, further reductions are expected until the 9.8% target for 2010 is reached.
Import licensing and quotas are also expected to be eliminated in phases.
Canadian exporters should ask their Chinese importers to disclose all relevant customs and import requirements and then verify these with China Customs and the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM).

For more detailed information on customs procedures, tariffs, and labelling requirements consult International Trade Canada-Trade Commissioner Service http://www.infoexport.gc.ca/ie-en/MarketProspect.jsp?cid=512&oid=32.
address Chinese by their surname and business title, e.g. Director Li, especially when speaking with government officials.
Accept and offer business cards with both hands, and make sure to study them for a few seconds before putting them carefully away.
Never give a clock, handkerchief, umbrella or white flowers, as these items signify tears and/or death.
Items bearing one’s company logo are best, e.g. mugs, pens, key chains.
Although the degree of formality in business practices is changing, many Chinese, especially government officials, still like to begin business meetings with an overview of their company.
Therefore, Chinese business people may often remain silent, provide mixed answers to questions, or avoid speaking about problems in business dealings, rather than openly expressing their concerns.
This does not, however, necessarily mean that they are disinterested.
Chinese may ask their business counterparts personal questions regarding their age, income and marital status, as this is not considered impolite in China.
Meals are still an integral part of Chinese culture so most businesses close for lunch from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. Additional business travel tips are available from Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada’s Consular Affairs website http://www.voyage.gc.ca/dest/report-en.asp?country=55000.
With consumers’ rising wealth and trend toward healthier eating, farmers are increasingly switching their production of basic cereals to vegetables and livestock.
Comprising 12.5% of China’s GDP and employing 49% of the population, the country’s agricultural sector is performing well although better sector infrastructure and modernization is needed.
The project has greatly assisted rural areas by providing large farms with professional factories for exporting agricultural goods, especially in regions where agriculture is the primary industry.

CHINA Agri-Food Consumer Profile August : 2004 Forward With a total population of 1.3 billion people, of which approximately 250 million are urbanized consumers, China boasts a market enjoying a growing discretionary income as well as a taste for international goods and services.
The diverse nature of the market makes the review of consumer data valuable when estimating export potential and niche markets.
Key points on Chinese consumers Growing tastes for international goods and services.
$ 39% of annual living expenditure allocated to food purchases.
$ Strong variations between urban and rural consumption patterns.
$ Chinese view Canadian products as high quality.
Strong variations in younger generation consumption compared to older generation consumption.
Chinese consumers appreciate and are willing to pay for quality, but react positively to a good bargain which caters to their innate desire to save,
The country’s population control program, or "one child rule" began in the late 1970's and has contributed to the trend in higher disposable incomes.
Purchasing power parity has grown from US$4,300 in 2001, to US$4,400 in 2002 and US$5,000 in 2003.
Major Cities/Regions and Corresponding food taste preferences: $ < < < < Food tastes vary by region with the eastern cities preferring sweet tastes, the north and northeast cities preferring salty, the central areas preferring hot and spicy and the south preferring delicate tastes.
CONSUMER DETAILS < < Strong variations in younger generation consumption compared to older generation consumption.
Senior age groups consume more rice, fruits and vegetables (traditional), while younger generations branch out consuming products such as processed foods, snacks, meats and alcoholic beverages (non-traditional).
Urbanized population consume more meat, processed food, restaurant meals and less grains.
Rural households grow most of their own food and have less access to markets, stores, processed food and refrigeration.
Grain is still a major component of the rural diet.
Consumer traits:
Imported products are generally accepted and viewed as high quality, safer, worthy of their higher price tag and in some cases stylish status symbols.
Consumers are attracted to established brand names, as they are seen as a guarantee of authentic and quality goods.
Chinese consumers have strong loyalty to high quality brands and frequently recommend those products and services to others, word of mouth communication is key to product success in China.
Although, there is little brand loyalty to foreign products, and fads come and go quickly.
Local manufacturers are always able to quickly replicate international products and produce them for less.
Therefore, there is great potential for imported products but domestic competition to follow is a strong threat.
An increase in consumption is determined by income levels as well as consumer confidence in recent overall economic situation.
Chinese consumers are recognized for their desire to save money, but they are willing to pay for quality and other positive factors in a product the meets their needs.
Younger consumers are now entering into their prime earning years and have a greater discretionary income.
The urban segment of the younger generation are familiarizing themselves with foreign lifestyles and global media.
Consumers prefer smaller packaging even though price may be higher.
Chinese consumers appreciate attractive packaging in terms of size, color and design.
Chinese consumers continue to prove their willingness and open-mindedness to new western tastes and products.
Traditionally, food products were purchased daily form local wet markets and dry goods from local state run stores.
Recently, western-style retail stores have slowly replaced this traditional retail structure.
Retail outlets have evolved to house flashy displays and a vast range of goods in one place.
< < < < < Supermarket chains are now in almost every Chinese city, while hypermarkets reside in most large cities.
Convenience store chains have also rapidly blanketed the country, mostly in East China.
Shanghai alone has over 2,500 convenience stores.
Distribution systems vary dramatically by region and market.
Eastern coastal regions including Shanghai and Beijing represent the strongest consumer markets for imported goods.
Distribution options for Canadian exporters include direct sales to retail outlets, existing distribution networks and warehousing, agents and sales reps, or establishing independent distribution networks.
Best option for small exporters is the use of a sales agent due to market and retail knowledge specific to the region.
REACHING THE CONSUMER - MARKETING PRACTICES It is often recommended that before jumping into the Chinese market, exporters should invest in targeted market research and taste testing.
In a country as large and diverse in tastes as China, it is critical to identify a specific target group of consumers and confirm if your product appeals to this group.
This practice is not meant to limit market potential, but rather decipher whether it exists, and is possible to build on.
TRENDS SPECIFIC TO CANADIAN FOOD EXPORTS China is Canada’s fourth largest export destination, and ninth largest source of imports.
Opportunity for Canadian agri-food exports exist.
China is an ideal market for Canada to capitalize on trends towards processed food products, specifically in fish, seafood and meats because of Canada’s reputation for high quality products.
Trends in the marketplace also reveal opportunity in the dairy products category, wine, beverages, confectionary and nutraceuticals.
An increase in retail space and consumer desire for convenience has provided a demand frozen and microwaveable food, which will likely continue to grow.

MARKET OVERVIEW Japan, with a population of almost 128 million people, is the world's largest net importer of food products.
The Kansai is home to 24 million people and accounts for a regional GDP larger than the countries of Canada or Australia.
The Kansai region of Japan also plays a central role in Japanese culinary culture, with its residents enjoying a reputation for the highest taste and food quality in Japan.
Osaka has grown as a commercial and distribution centre for food commodities.
Total food imports for the Kansai region in 2003 were $14.5 billion, down just slightly from 2002.
Japanese family-style restaurant chains are important targets for Canadian food exporters looking to promote their products to the Japanese food service industry.
Although their demand for price, quality, and delivery is high, Japanese family-style restaurant management practices are often more forward thinking than those of traditional Japanese restaurant businesses.
As a result, they are more open to considering imported products, with some chain owners creating their own in-house import operations.
This report focuses on Japanese family-style restaurant chain operators, particularly those operators based in the Kansai region of Japan.
The family-style restaurant business in Japan started in 1970 when Skylark Co., Ltd opened its first restaurant in Kunitachi City in Tokyo.
The preponderance of such restaurants grew in accordance with the rapid growth of the Japanese economy, particularly in the 1970s and 80s.
Skylark Co., Ltd is now the top family-style restaurant chain operator in terms of annual sales (see Table 1.).
Current Top-10 Family-Style Restaurant Chain Operators in Japan Ranking by Sales Corporate Name Company Headquarters Annual Sales (2003) ($ millions) Number of outlets 1 Skylark Co., Ltd.
"Japan Company Hand Book 2004 Spring," January 26, 2004.
It is estimated that the size of the Japan food service market in 2003, including hotel catering and all dining-out businesses such as restaurants, fast food counters, and cafeterias, was around $296 billion.
The top-10 family-style restaurants above account for about 3.5% of this industry.
Japanese family-style restaurant chains offer a wide variety of menu items to their customers at a reasonable cost, including dishes from Japan, Italy, China, and Korea.
To lower operation costs, these chains purchase ingredients in large volume and process them in central kitchens.
Most of the food preparation occurs in these central kitchens, and the kitchens of individual restaurants are responsible for only the final stage of warming up, frying, or sautéing the semi-processed products for the consumer.
Family-style restaurant chains have modern management systems and tend to be more business-oriented than traditional food service industry players.
They are very open-minded to foreign food suppliers that can provide products which meet their requirements.
Some chain operators also import food products directly from foreign suppliers in order to reduce the costs of the multi-layered food distribution system in Japan.
OPPORTUNITIES Canadian companies should target different restaurant chains depending on the product they are trying to sell.
Currently, there are strong differences in company strategy among family-style restaurants, particularly in regards to pricing.
Family restaurant chains such as Saizeria (operated by Saizeria Co., Ltd.) or Gusto (operated by Skylark Co., Ltd.) offer less expensive menu items, but variety and service are limited.
In all cases, restaurant operators are seeking to distinguish their chain based on value, variety, and/or quality.
As mentioned, some family-style restaurant chains have established their own direct import operations with foreign suppliers.
Targeting these companies allows Canadian exporters to enter the market without getting involved in Japan's complicated food distribution system.
However, suppliers should be aware that restaurant chains demand a high volume of product of consistent quality with as little variation in price as possible.
Meeting these requirements is challenging, but companies able to comply with such guidelines will increase their chances of success in the Japanese family-style restaurant market.
The Kansai region is the home of Japanese culinary culture.
Historically speaking, the city of Kyoto was the capital of Japan for more than 1000 years.
Most traditional Japanese cuisine was developed in Kyoto and passed on to other regions of Japan.
The City of Osaka was developed as a commercial and distribution centre for food commodities to support the culinary culture in Kyoto.
Even now people in the Kansai region, particularly those in Osaka, are noted for their love of food and their propensity to spend on gourmet and exotic foods.
Presently, there are more than 150 000 restaurants in the Kansai region -- roughly 20% of all of Japan's restaurants -- with over 70 000 in Osaka City alone.
To survive fierce competition, family-style restaurant chains in the Kansai must continually improve their operations and services.
There are three (see below) well-known family-style restaurant chains operating out of the Kansai region, with all three focussing on the development of "Japanese food" menu items.
To avoid any misunderstanding, it must be noted that this is not the highly-priced, formal Japanese food (Japanese haute cuisine) which traditionally consists of several courses of fancy-looking food.
Instead, Kansai-based family-style restaurants promote "modern" Japanese cuisine which has developed since Japan was introduced to western culture in the 19th century.
Examples of this type of cuisine include deep-fried pork (Tonkatsu), hamburger patties (without the bun), and grilled meat or fish with a soy-based sauce.
A wide variety of meat, fish, and western vegetables are used in this type of cuisine, thereby providing opportunity to foreign food suppliers, including those from Canada.
Generally speaking, these family-style restaurant chain operators are very open to foreign products as long as the products meet their standards in terms of quality, safety, and cost.
In addition, it must be noted that one company in Osaka imports directly from foreign food suppliers.
This gives Canadian companies a potentially easier entry into the Kansai region market.
For product sourcing, all family-style restaurant chains feel the need to diversify their supply sources due to the recent incidents of BSE, the breakout of Avian flu, and problems resulting from agricultural chemical residue in Chinese vegetables.
KEY PARTICIPANTS The Kansai region imported $861 million worth of Canadian food in 2003, giving Canada 4th spot, or 5.92% of Kansai's imported agri-food market share, after that of the United States (30.86%), China (14.49%) and Australia (8.92%).
Despite this respectable showing, Canadian market share has decreased compared to its foreign competitors.
This is in part due to market restrictions based on food safety issues, but perhaps can also be attributed to Canadian exporters' lack of activity or focus in the regional markets in Japan.
PRIVATE- AND PUBLIC-SECTOR CUSTOMERS The average spending per guest at family-style restaurants is estimated to be about $11.48.
Customers spend, on average, $8.88 - $9.12 per person at Saizaria or Gusto, but more than $14.21 at Sato or Kagonoya.
Just as restaurant chains seek to distinguish themselves based on value versus quality and variety, consumers choose different family-style restaurant chains depending on the dining situation.
It is important to note these differences and tailor Canadian exporting strategies to the respective chains.
It may also be of interest for Canadian exporters in developing a market strategy to understand how often customers dine at family-style restaurants, and how often family-style restaurants are frequented in the current Japanese economy (see Graph 1.).
Japan Consumer Market Research Institute More than 66% of Japanese dine at family-style restaurants more than once a month.
Interestingly, this same survey revealed that single females, such as students or office workers, are the most frequent users of family-style restaurants.
Almost half (46.5%) of single young females replied that they frequent family-style restaurants more than twice a month.
Consumers who dine more than once a month at family-style restaurants indicated that they use family-style restaurants for: 1) weekend or holiday lunches, 2) weekend or holiday dinners, and 3) weekday lunches.
Below are brief profiles of three well-known Kansai-based family-style restaurant chain operators:
Sato is the 10th-largest family-style restaurant chain operator in Japan, with 247 outlets as of June 2004.
Sato's operation is centred in the Kansai region, but is expanding to other parts of Japan such as Nagoya and Tokyo.
This chain has focussed on a modern Japanese-style menu since its inception, and is considered to be a rather high-end family-style restaurant.
The average bill per person is currently $14.21, but this figure is increasing.
The most unique aspect of this company is that they have their own direct import operations, particularly for items such as seafood and meat.
They currently import pork from Canada for a deep-fried pork dish.
Friendly Corporation Ranked 14th or 15th in Japan in terms of sales as of June 2004, Friendly operates 140 restaurants in the Kansai region.
They began their business as a western family-style restaurant operator under the restaurant name of "FRIENDLY".
However, due to the declining popularity of western-style family dining, Friendly has opened restaurants under the name BONDS, which focuses on Japanese cuisine in a family-style restaurant setting.
Currently, half of Friendly's restaurants now operate under the BONDS name, and this percentage is expected to continue growing.
The average bill per customer at FRIENDLY is $9.95, but $15.40 for BONDS.
Kinrei Corporation Kinrei started as a frozen food manufacturer and entered the family-style restaurant business in early 1990.
Since then, they have developed into a chain of 55 restaurants as of June 2004.
Their restaurant brand, KAGONOYA, is considered to be the most high-end family-style restaurant in the Kansai region.
They serve exclusively Japanese-style dishes, and the average bill per customer is more than $17.77.
Until the outbreak of BSE in the United States, Kagonoya promoted a beef "Shabu-Shabu" menu item (thinly sliced meat boiled in hot water at the customer's table).
They have since shifted to pork Shabu-Shabu and are currently using Canadian pork for this menu item.

There is no clear definition of the term "Family-Style Restaurant Chain", even within the Japanese food service industry.
Most restaurants that fall into this category are equipped with large parking lots, child-friendly decor, and offer a wide variety of menu items that appeal to customers of all ages.

Government Regulations Japanese Government May Label Animal Products as Organic Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) is in the process of establishing a "Japan Agricultural Standard" (JAS) certification for organic animal products and processed animal products.
The current JAS organic labelling system is voluntary and applies only to products of vegetal origin.
The candidates for the new certification include beef, chicken, milk, eggs, and processed stock farm products including sausage and cheese.
In order to obtain organic JAS mark, the products must meet six requirements, including:
• Livestock should be fed with pasture grass that grew in fields where neither chemical fertilizers nor pesticides is used for at least two years;
• Livestock is to be raised in an environment with sufficient sunlight;
• Antibiotics should not be mixed in feed.
According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, if the JAS Council, an advisory panel to the MAFF, approves the proposal, the new system cold be implemented in fiscal year 2005.
MAFF Publishes Basic Policy on Handling of Food Safety Crises The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries recently published a basic policy to be used as a framework for formulating more detailed measures combating food safety crisis caused by new viruses, unknown diseases or other similar threats.
The policy calls for close collaboration with other ministries, emphasizes data collection and analysis, as well as active ongoing information exchange with experts.
In addition, a countermeasures headquarter would be established within the MAFF in case of an emergency.
Based on the abovementioned basic policy, the government approved a package of emergency measures earlier this year, in response to the avian flu outbreak in Japan.
The package specified the measures to be taken in order to prevent spread of the disease, to protect public health and to ease fears over food safety issues.
Additionally, the package proposed to amend the Law for the Control of Infectious Diseases in Animals by adding measures to promote early reporting of outbreaks and to provide support for poultry farmers and businesses in related industries.
Early Days for Western Supermarket / Retail Groups It has been almost two years since Wal-Mart took over Seiyu, Japan's fifth-largest supermarket chain.
The acquisition brought much chaos to the Japanese retail industry while some analysts were sceptical about the effectiveness of Wal-Mart's cost-cutting strategy given the realities of the Japanese retail sector.
Last month, Seiyu reported that same-store customer numbers were down by 2% in 2003.
In addition, the company lost 7 billion yen (C$86 million) for the year ending in December -- the second consecutive year of loss.
However, Wal-Mart is not the only foreign retailer tumbling in Japan.
Carrefour, the world's second-largest supermarket group, experienced similar difficulties after its establishment in Japan 4 years ago.
Recently, Carrefour switched from a low-cost strategy to emphasizing its French roots.
Following Wal-Mart and Carrefour, Tesco, Britain's supermarket giant, has been actively boosting its presence in Japan's food retail industry.
On April 27th, Tesco announced a plan to purchase Fre'c, an indebted mid-size grocery store operator, via Tesco's subsidiary C-Two Network, which was acquired last July for about C$341 million.
Fre'c (short for "fresh and cost") operates 27 outlets in the Tokyo metropolitan area that are believed to be complementary to the C-Two's processed foods business.
A report by Financial Times indicates that differences between Japanese and American consumer shopping habits could be one of the factors hindering the effectiveness of "every-day low prices" strategies that international retailers attempt to use in Japan.
However, an analyst from Goldman Sachs in Tokyo believes that foreign competitors are about to impose significant changes on the Japanese retail industry by introducing inventory databases, supply chain management, and advanced pricing practices.
Dog Food Caters to Greying Population Recently, major dog food manufacturers have begun promoting new products with different features for the old aged dogs.
For example, dog meals from Nissin Pet Food Inc. and Nippon Pet Food Inc. are supplemented with glucosamine to help maintain smooth joints, while others like Unicharm PetCare Corp. and Hannama Foods emphasize improving dogs' immune systems by adding extra vitamins and other nutritional ingredients to products.
A recent report by Nikkei points out that Japan's dog population reached 11.13 million in 2003, a 17% increase on a yearly basis.
Industry analysts attribute rapid growth to the increasing numbers of "office ladies" (especially those living alone) and the aging demographics, who want to keep dogs as companions.
According to a Japanese pharmaceutical manufacturer, approximately 1 million dogs suffer from arthritis and other symptoms linked to advanced age.
100-Yen Shops Aim To Expand Alcohol Sales In Japan, the deregulation of alcohol sales has led to a new trend in sales of alcoholic beverages including beer, low-malt beer and canned "chuhai" cocktails.
A recent report from Nikkei Shimbun shows that Japan's major 100-yen stores (similar concept to one-dollar store in Canada) intend to increase available alcohol items and expand alcohol sales in their outlets.
Sale prices of alcoholic beverages are 10-30% lower than suggested retail prices.
Ostrich Meat Consumption Surges 130% In 5 Years Through '03 Nikkei Shimbun reports that the popularity of ostrich meat in Japan has been picking up over the last two years.
In 2003, estimated domestic consumption reached 460 tons with 87% imported from overseas.
Following the outbreaks of BSE and bird flu, consumers have demonstrated an increased interest in ostrich meat as an alternative because the texture of ostrich meat is similar to beef but has less fat and calories.
However, the high cost -- 4,000 yen (C$50) per kilogram -- and limited availability may hinder sales to the public at this stage.
Japan Food Makers Increase Output Of Health Food Ingredients The boosting sales of functional products have contributed to recent trends of expanding production of health-enhancing ingredients.
According to Nikkei, Fuji Oil Co. invested 1.6 billion yen (C$20 million) to triple the production of soybean peptide, an anti-fatigue substance to be used in functional products.
Q.P. Corp is about to set up facility for manufacturing hyaluronic acid with skin moisturizing function in May.
Kaneka Corp., Japan's largest producer of co-enzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a cellular energy production facilitator, intends to double the output capacity to 150 tons per year.
The projected sales of its functional food related operation would double by fiscal year 2006.
Nippon Suisan Kaisha Ltd. tries to increase its EPA and DHA production by 70%.
Taiyo Kagaku Co. intends to expand the annual catechin production to 2,000 tons at its joint venture company in China.
The move is a reaction to the popularity of functional products, which contain catechin, known as antioxidant and anti-cancer agent.
"Beauty from Inside Out" - New Approach of Coca-Cola Japan On April 21st, Coca-Cola Japan brought to the Japanese market a new diet beverage called "Body Style Water", made from grapefruit juice with caffeine and seaweed extract added.
According to JCNN Tokyo, the water has a body lotion companion - "Body Stylish Mist" that contains the same ingredients.
The lotion was developed by Shiseido Japan and was launched in late March.
Both products are promoted under the same brand "Aroma Works".
The water is sold at 160 yen (C$2) for a 410 ml bottle while the lotion is priced at 892 yen (C$11.15). Coca-Cola Japan Co. also introduced a new diet Coke in Japan ahead of its release in the US.
Named "C2", the product maintains the same taste while contains less than half the calories of regular Coca-Cola.
This new Diet Coke would be the first Coca-Cola product to be first launched outside the U.S. and other major markets, according to the Asian Wall Street Journal.
The company will give out five million samples throughout Japan, which marks its biggest sales promotion campaign since its Diet Coke brand introduced more than 20 years ago.
Green Tea Catechin Halves Growth of Cancer Cells A research group at Kyushu University has found one of the major components of the green tea catechin is effective for holding back the growth of cancer cells.
The initial analysis indicated that a tiny amount of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the major component in catechin, could decrease the growth of cancer cells by 50%.
The findings are expected to attract widespread attention for their potential application to the development of anticancer agents.
Canadian Potato Exports to Japan Figures from World Trade Atlas show that Canada exported over C$44 million worth of frozen potato products to Japan in 2003, taking second place among foreign potato suppliers.
Canada's potato exports to Japan were far behind the first place, as the U.S. accounts for about 80% of Japan's imported potato market.
Half of Japan's imported frozen potatoes are used by the fast food industry due to pricing 30- 50% lower than domestic potatoes.
Recently however, Nihon Nogyo Shimbun reported that the Japanese government aims to increase its potato self-sufficiency rate for the sake of food safety from the current 80% to 84% by 2010.
Maple Syrup Picking up Popularity in Japan According to Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Queen Bee Gardens, a Shizuoka-based importer handling maple syrup from Quebec, claims that demand in Japan is rising and diversifying.
Once used only on hotcakes, Japanese consumers are increasingly using maple syrup in breads, cakes, puddings, cookies and other products.
Japan's annual imports of maple syrup have doubled since 1999.
Currently, Canada accounts for 79% of this market.
In 2003, Canada exported 1,531 tons of maple syrup to Japan, valued at C$13 million.
Foodex Japan 2004 From March 9th to 12th, Foodex Japan 2004, the 29th annual food and beverage show was held at the Nippon Convention Centre in Chiba.
A total of 1,719 international exhibitors, a 10% increase from last year, showcased their products at the event.
Over 90,000 food industry professionals and buyers attended the fair, up by 7% from Foodex 2003.
The main focus this year was on organic and natural agricultural products, nutritional supplements, as well as food for special health uses or with nutritional functions.
Also worth noting is the continuing trend of convenience and ready-to-serve foods.
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, in collaboration with the Canadian Embassy in Tokyo, organized Canada's presence at this event.
Numerous Canadian companies exhibited their food products in the Canadian pavilion.
Canadian companies or organization held three seminars:
Pacific Western Brewing Company, a BC-based company, held an information session on its certified organic beverages (beer, coolers and spring water); the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers presented detailed information on maple syrup quality control to Japanese buyers; and finally, Sunterra Meats Ltd. featured its high-quality pork and new Tonkatsu product gear to the food service and retail industries.
A networking reception was held on March 11 at the Canadian Embassy in Tokyo, where Canadian companies has the chance to meet with over 200 Japanese business contacts.
Listing of Future Events In order to better assist Canadian companies with promoting their products to the Japanese market, the Food Section of the Canadian Embassy has prepared a list of major food trade shows and exhibitions taking place in Japan.

Market Information Asia Pacific Korea Ag-News December 2006
NEWS CLIPPING Canada seeks wider agricutlural access in FTA talks Canada has pushed for wider access to Korea's agriculture market during the eighth round of talks for a bilateral free trade agreement last week, the government said yesterday.
Canadian negotiators asked Seoul to revise its proposals for beef and pork, saying that an FTA would have to benefit the Canadian livestock industry, the Seoul's Agriculture Ministry said.
But it stressed that Korean negotiators explained their difficulty in changing the country's position on agricultural goods, citing the politically sensitive nature of the farming industry and the difficulty faced by local farmers.
The ninth will be held in Canada during the fourth week of January next year.
Bone chip found in US beef A bone chip has been discovered in the first shipment of US beef to land in Korea.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) announced that a small piece of bone was discovered in a box of chuck flap tail - the bone was detected through the x-ray process by which every carton is being inspected.
The beef was shipped by the Kansas based processor Creekstone Farms, and it is anticipated that the Creekstone plant's approval to export to Korea will be suspended.
Due to the failure of the quarantine process, the product will be shipped back to the US or destroyed. The nine tonnes of airfreighted US beef was the first to be sent to South Korea since the US was banned in 2003 due to BSE.
The market was officially reopened in early September this year.

MARKET INTELLIGENCE – OILS AND FATS (extract from a study by Euromonitor) Organic oils and fats set for the fast growth Organic products showed the highest growth among HW oils and fats.
Organic oils and fats are only available in olive oil and vegetable & seed oil.
Within these areas, organic products have recently grown robustly.
This healthy performance stems from the country's burgeoning wellbeing boom.
Industry efforts to feature additional health benefits for inherently healthy product groups have also contributed to the pattern.
For example, the latest organic launches in olive oil have attracted highly health-conscious consumers through online or offline organic shopping stores, or the food corners of prestigious department stores.
While small-scale players largely shape the demand, sales are showing an impressive pace of growth.
The major reason for the lack of product availability in other areas such as margarine, butter, and spreadable oils & fats is fact that these product groups are more or less unhealthy due to their levels of fat.
This implies that inherently unhealthy food items are unfavorably poised to secure any significant HW demand.
The key organic olive oil brand is Organic Lio Extra Virgin Olive Oil produced by Lio in Turkey.
As a promotional tool, distributors mainly emphasize the name power of the brand and the company as one of the world's best organic olive oil producers.
In contrast to the domination of organic olive oil by an imported label, organic vegetable & seed oil is dominated by small-scale domestic players.
When it comes to distribution, the channels available for such products are currently limited, as only online organic stores and limited offline food stores offer them.
Naturally healthy oils and fats dominate in HW oils and fats Sales of ‘naturally healthy' olive oil account for over 13% of total oils and fats sales.
Olive oil sales grew strongly from 2000 onwards.
Increasing health concerns held by South Korean consumers, coupled with the wellbeing boom, underpinned the growth.
In the meantime, the growth seen in 2003 was unprecedented, with total retail consumption volume of olive oil jumping a marked 110%, from 2,650 tonnes in 2002 to 5,610 tonnes in 2003.
This phenomenon was driven by an influx of domestic oils and fats players into olive oil with their own local labels, using imported materials.
Baeksul Extra Virgin Olive Oil by CJ Corp was the only domestic brand.
In 2003, however, domestic oils and fats players aggressively entered the field, attempting to benefit from this increasingly lucrative area.
New domestic brands included Haepyo Compressed Olive Oil by Shindongbang Co Ltd, Ottogi Fresco Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Ottogi Fresco Pure Olive Oil by Ottogi Co Ltd, and Chungjungwon Chambitgoun Olive Oil by Daesang Group.
The core growth engines look set to be organic olive oil and organic vegetable & seed oil.
Industry players may move into featuring additional health benefits to existing formats in order to push up sales.
Consumers are also increasingly exposed to organic oils and fats.
Despite their high price levels, products are still attractive due to their prestigious images and high quality ingredients.
Compounded by the country's emerging organic boom, there is ample growth potential in the near future based on the currently small demand base.
Nevertheless, a narrow base of high-end consumers will continue to form the majority of demand.
In olive oil, foreign organic labels imported from overseas are likely to lead the sales for the time being, as domestic production of olive is not possible in the local climate.
Future outlook Organic oils and fats to show healthiest growth The future of HW oils and fats looks bright at the moment.
The key growth factor is likely to be increasing health concerns held by South Koreans, compounded by the country's burgeoning wellbeing boom.
The highest growth looks set to stem from organic olive oil and organic vegetable & seed oil.
This is partly from their rather embryonic sales bases at the moment, coupled with the country's emerging organic boom.
As consumers and industry players are both increasingly moving towards the additional health benefits of the already healthy oils and fats products, substantial growth is likely in the near future.
Over the forecast period, organic oils and fats products are predicted to double their presence overall in constant value terms, taking a share of 1.2% in 2009.
Oils and fats are an essential cooking item.
As the consumption of the products is more or less necessary, consumers are likely to seek health benefits from the given products rather than seeking out alternatives in other product areas.
Because of this, manufacturers will increasingly add health benefits to existing products, as well as creating new product ranges with a health orientation.
Olive oil ready for HW diversification With greater product availability, coupled with enlarged distribution channels, organic olive oil looks set to continue its robust growth momentum.
Most local consumers are well aware of the health benefits of olive oil.
In the past, higher pricing over vegetable & seed oil discouraged its consumption.
While recently introduced domestic brands by leading local producers still carry high pricing, similar to imported brands, increasing product availability suggests the possibility that future pricing will be reduced to a certain extent over the forecast period.
If this happens, the consumer base is expected to widen, leading to increasing local demand for organic olive oil, which will contribute to the overall growth of olive oil sales.
Home to a relatively affluent population of over 48 million, South Korea offers a large market for agri-food products.
 Korea imports 60-70% of its food requirements and runs a significant food trade deficit.
In 2005, Korea imported US$10.9 billion in agri-food products and US$2.3 billion in fish and seafood products.
In 2005, Korea was the fifth largest market for Canadian agri-food exports.
The Korean consumer market is highly developed and Western styled foods are growing in popularity.
Overall, consumers demand high-quality, convenient and healthy products.
Changes in lifestyle and diet, as well as increasing affluence, have resulted in growing demand for convenient and processed foods.
Recently, the "well-being" phenomenon has swept through food industry.
The image that Koreans have of Canada is that of a clean, natural, unspoiled country.
Marketing and branding that associates food products with Canada's favourable image may be successful in South Korea.
The Seoul Food & Hotel 2007 results from a merger of the country's two best recognized exhibitions, Seoul Food and Food & Hotel Korea, with a combined track record of more than 20 years.
There will be two distinct sections of the new Seoul Food & Hotel exhibition.
The first will be for domestic exhibitors and open to the public.
The second, international part will be consisted of national groups and admission is restricted to trade only.

Market Information Asia Pacific Competition Begins South Korea's Sandwich Franchising Market June 2004
1) ISSUE Urban Koreans eat out frequently.
Fast paced lifestyles are driving Koreans to choose western-style fast-food, but healthy eating is a concern.
These factors are driving a fast growing market for sandwich store franchising.
2) DESCRIPTION Restaurants abound in urban Korea.
The large majority serve sit-down meals of Korean-style food, but western-style fast food is rapidly becoming more popular.
Consumers must choose a menu that satisfies their demands for taste, cost, and nutrition and speed of service.
In the past, those seeking a fast meal would have been satisfied by fast-food giants like McDonald's or Burger King, but that is changing.
As more people are becoming health conscious, the importance of nutrition is growing.
Reports on the harmful effects of fast-food have raised concern, and consumers are seeking better choices.
This new trend has opened doors for a steadily growing market for fresh and healthy sandwich businesses.
Lotteria is a local hamburger franchiser and is the fast-food market leader in Korea.
From 2002 to 2003 Lotteria experienced a sharp sales drop of 40%.
However, a strong contrast was seen in the South Korean sandwich market, as its $41.20 million1 market value in the second quarter of 2003 doubled to $82.40 million in the fourth quarter.
This dramatic growth is forecast to continue, and the anticipated market value for 2004 is $117.71 million.
The first local sandwich franchising business Sandday was established in 1997, but it is only recently that prospects in this market have begun to rise.
This recent growth has started attracting foreign participants, and franchisers like Subway Korea, Schlotzsky's Deli, Quizno's Sub, Au Bon Pain and Tantalus are busy building up a strong business foundation for a long-term profit.
In response to the aggressive foreign companies, they are also coming up with strategies to secure their position within the market, and the competition is about to heat up.
Instead of just plain white bread, a variety of choices including bagel, hoagie, rye bread are used, along with organic vegetables and other fresh ingredients.
These wholesome sandwiches are seen as a smart, healthy choice.
Despite prices that can exceed $9, response is good.
Subway Korea first entered the market in 2000 and now has 55 franchise stores.
The average daily sales in its franchise stores are between $1200 and $2400, with average monthly sales of around $70 000.
The largest local sandwich franchiser is Sandpresso, with 78 franchisees in 2003.
It plans to increase that number to 150 by the end of 2004.
Large local food processing companies have also begun participating and Sandpresso, managed by Dong-won F&B, is an example.
3) IMPACT ON CANADIAN COMPANIES The new trend is propelling growth in the franchising market.
It is anticipated that the market will experience intense competition for the next five years, until the top three or four leaders are determined.
Canadian companies should be able to take advantage of the situation and enter the market without much difficulty, while it is still at an early stage of development.
Although a large franchiser could utilize its economy of scale and systemized networking, that will not necessarily guarantee success in this market.
4) CONTACTS If your company is interested in this sector in Korea, please contact the Canadian Embassy in Seoul.

Market Information Asia Pacific South Korean Consumer Attitudes Towards Foreign Food Products August 2004
1) ISSUE The effects of recent high-profile food safety issues, such as BSE and avian influenza, on general consumer food purchasing and consumption trends in Korea.
2) DESCRIPTION The Canadian Embassy in Korea recently commissioned a consumer survey to learn more about Korean habits and attitudes toward the foods they buy and eat.
The purpose of this survey was to assist Canadian companies in making marketing decisions based on current food purchasing trends in Korea.
The survey was based on 600 face-to-face interviews with self-declared food purchase decision makers.
All information and statistics that follow originated from the survey.
Korean households claimed to spend an average of $427 per month on food.
About half of Korean households indicated they dine out at least once a week, and they tend to choose a foreign restaurant about 16% of the time.
In contrast to traditional Korean culture, the data indicates that it has become rare for Koreans to invite guests to their homes.
Friends and family members are the most reliable sources of information taken into consideration when purchasing food.
Other important sources cited, in descending order of importance, are:
• Television and radio
Household food buyers listed the categories of 'fresh fruits and vegetables', 'seafood and fish' and 'nonalcoholic beverages' as their most frequent purchases.
The country of origin of food is important to Korean consumers and is apparently considered in every food and cooking related situation.
Koreans prefer Korean foods over imported foods, although they are open to foreign alcoholic beverages and meats such as veal and lamb.
Many consumers prefer to purchase meat in specialty stores.
The most frequently purchased meat is pork, followed by poultry and beef.
The survey implies that 46% of Korean households eat some imported beef.
For those households, imported beef accounts for only 40% of their beef purchases.
Of the consumers who eat imported beef, 37% thought its origin to be from the United States, 23% from Australia, 7% from New Zealand and 4% from Canada.
The remainder did not know the country of origin of their foreign beef.
Other important criteria influencing food purchasing behavior are (in descending order of importance)
• health
• taste
• nutrition Food safety concerns, such as BSE (mad cow disease) and avian influenza, caused the surveyed consumers to reduce their consumption of beef and poultry between January and April 2004, but this appears to be rebounding slowly.
Despite general concerns about food safety, most Korean consumers tend to trust their retailers and government controls.
When questioned about their sources of information for food safety information, survey participants cited the same sources as for general food information.
In descending order:
• friends and family
• store displays and signs.
Many Koreans show a positive attitude towards Canada, based on its favourable reputation, clean environment, and trustworthy and likeable people.
These factors have put Canada above the United States, Australia and New Zealand in the minds of Korean consumers.
The most notable food associated with Canada seems to be beef.
3) IMPACT ON CANADIAN COMPANIES Food consumers in South Korea appear to have a positive image of Canada.
Canadian food exporters should use this positive evaluation as a competitive advantage in branding their products.
Canadian companies should focus on developing marketing strategies that emphasize the healthy, tasty and nutritious qualities of Canadian food, as well as its safety.
Active marketing which leads Korean consumers to associate a food product with Canada's favourable image will be beneficial.
4) CONTACTS Companies interested in entering the Korean marketplace should contact the Canadian Embassy In South Korea for more market information.

MARKET OVERVIEW Japan's mountainous landscape renders only 13% of its land suitable for agriculture.
In 2004, Japan imported approximately $4.2 billion(2) worth of Canadian agri-food and seafood--a 10% increase over 2003.
Canadian imports accounted for close to 6% of Japan's total $71 billion of agri-food imports in 2004.
(Japan is Canada's second largest export market for food products accounting for nearly 10% of Canada's exports in 2004.)
With its heavy reliance on imported agri-food, Japan has consistently been a major importing country for Canadian high-quality grains, oil seeds, animal feed and related products.
If seafood is excluded from the food imports from Canada, food crops and animal feed account for nearly half of the total agri-food imports.
Canada provides Japan with a constant supply of canola seeds, wheat, and an increasing amount of food-grade soybeans.
This profile focuses on trends in Japanese imports of selected agricultural commodities.
Market Trends Canola (Rapeseed) In 2004, total Japanese imports of canola seeds for crushing were valued at $1.1 billion--an increase of 14.0% over 2003.
Canada continues to be Japan's largest import source and accounts for roughly 70-80% of the total market.
Imports from Canada increased to $788 million (up 4.0% from 2003) and 1.68 million metric tons (MT), an increase of 1.4% over 2003.
Australia has become a steady supplier with a market share reaching 27.2% of Japanese imports by volume in 2004.
Meanwhile, Japan imported over 50 000 MT of canola from France in 2003; however, there were no such imports recorded in 2004.
For the past several years, annual demand for canola seed in Japan has been stable at around two million tons.
However, crushers were required to import over 2.3 million MT in 2004 to make up for a shortage of soybeans.
Approximately 60% of the canola oil produced from seed is used as household cooking oil, while 40% is used for food processing in products such as margarine, mayonnaise and salad dressing.
Most canola seeds are crushed and processed into canola oil and its bi-product meals, which are used exclusively for feed and fertilizer production.
Total meal production is declining over the long term due to a downturn in feed demand from the livestock sector.
There are no tariffs on the importation of canola seeds.
However, tariffs for canola oil are set at 13.2 yen per kilogram or 10.9 yen if the acid value exceeds 0.6.
Tariffs will remain in place until, at the least, the completion of the next round of WTO agricultural negotiations.
Soybeans In 2004, Japanese imports of soybeans decreased slightly to 4.4 million MT from 5.2 million MT in 2003, due to a world supply shortage.
However, total import value increased from $2.1 to $2.3 billion.
The US is Japan's largest supplier of soybeans with a 72.1% market share at 3.18 million MT, followed by Brazil with 17.7% at 0.78 million MT and by Canada with 5.9% at 0.26 million MT.
In 2004, imports from Canada increased 37.5% by volume and 62.9% by value due to better supply conditions compared with the other countries.
Canada has emerged as the third largest import source for Japan since 1999.
Most Canadian soybeans imported into Japan were non-genetically modified (GM) and were utilized mainly for tofu (soybean curd) and miso (soybean paste).
Small quantities of soybeans are also used for natto (fermented whole beans), while soybeans for soymilk have increased significantly due to the growing popularity of soymilk.
Approximately 77% of the total demand is for use as oil, 21% for use as food, and the remaining 2% for use as feed.
Nearly one million MT of food grade soybeans are used for fresh, frozen, and fried tofu, miso, natto, soy milk, boiled soybeans and soy sauce.
Consumption of food soybeans in 2005 is expected to be flat.
Wheat In 2004, annual imports of wheat increased by 4.7% to 5.5 million MT (approximately $1.66 billion).
The United States continues to be the largest import source for Japan with 53.4% of the market by value at $889 million and 55.9% share by volume, followed by Canada and Australia.
Canada supplied 23.6% share by value at $393 million and 21.2% by volume at 1.16 million MT during 2004.
Wheat, barley and rice production, sales and procurement are under the jurisdiction of the Japanese government, and there have been no major changes in import levels for decades.
Wheat consumption has gradually increased over the past several years due to a shift from rice to processed wheat products such as bread and pasta.
It should be noted that domestic production is also rising as some rice farmers are switching to wheat production.
In 2004, domestic wheat production increased 0.5% over the previous year to 859 900 MT.
OPPORTUNITIES The Japanese food processing industry (e.g. vegetable oil processing and flour milling industry) is highly oriented to the import market.
Canada is the largest exporter of canola, flax, mustard seed and malt to Japan and the second largest exporter for wheat, barley and food-grade soybeans.
Japan is expected to remain as a major market for Canadian agricultural commodities.
Image and reputation of Canadian agricultural products (e.g. wheat, barley and the others) are very high for both consumers and the Japanese food processing industry.
Japanese vegetable oil crushers produced nearly 950 000 MT of canola oil in 2004.
Canola oil is the most consumed edible oil in Japan followed by soybean oil.
As production of canola in Japan is very limited, Japanese demand is dependent entirely on imports.
On April 1, 2001, Japan instituted mandatory labelling requirements on foods derived from biotechnology, such as food grade soybeans.
As a result, many food processors shifted their sources from the US to other countries that promote non-GM soybeans--primarily Canada and Brazil.
There has been new demand for oilseed meals as a substitute for animal-origin meals since the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) infected cattle in Japan in September 2001.
The quality of Japanese domestic wheat is generally evaluated as lower than that of imported wheat and so its use is limited primarily to noodle production and as filler.
(Since domestic wheat is low in protein, flour millers mix it with higher protein imported varieties.)
Canada is Japan's only import source for durum wheat with nearly 100% market share at $70 million in value and around 198 000 MT by volume.
Canada is now the single largest exporter of barley malt, flax and mustard seed to Japan.
Japan maintains an overall agricultural self-sufficiency rating of about 40% (calorie basis) and as a result, relies extensively on imported foodstuffs.
Rice, vegetables and eggs are a few of the products in which Japan is self-sufficient to a rating of over 80%.
In early 2005, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) re-announced a self-sufficiency target of 45% on a caloric basis for 2015.
Japan's self-sufficiency consistently declined for many years but has remained steady at 40% since 1998.
It is doubtful that Japan will be able to increase its self-sufficiency significantly for a variety of reasons, including the high cost of production and the aging of the farm sector.
Canada is well positioned to cover the gap by supplying high quality agricultural commodity products to Japan.
With the Japanese government's implementation of the Food Hygiene Law & Feed Security Legislation, effective July 1, 2003, there has been strong demand for products that meet both the high standards of identity preservation and food and feed safety requirements.
KEY PARTICIPANTS As a net importer of agricultural commodities products, Japan relies on foreign suppliers to ensure the provision of important food crops.
Canada's main competitors in key export markets are principally the United States and Australia.
The United States is the largest supplier with over 60% market share in terms of grains & oilseeds.
As a major provider of wheat as well as canola, Australia is also a key competitor being the third largest supplier of food crops (behind Canada) with around 11% market share.
These three countries combine to account for 94% of Japan's total grain and oilseed imports.
Competitors gain an advantage through better harvesting weather (only in certain years), freight efficiencies (especially for the US) and by the ability to offer products during Canada's off-season (Australia).
The Japanese food industry, including the grain and oilseed processing industry, is currently going through a major consolidation and efficiency improvement process.
For example, as of December 2001, there were 53 domestic oil-crushing factories in Japan with a total crushing capacity of 8.9 million MT.
Due to shrinking profitability, the number of crushers has declined gradually over the years as companies consolidate.
There were 117 crushing factories in 1990.
The Japanese government began to provide crushing capacity data biannually from 1999.
In a realignment that started in 2001 and continued through 2004, Japan's top seven edible oil companies were consolidated into two.
Nisshin Oillio Group Ltd., which became the world's third-largest firm in terms of oil expression volume, and J-Oil Mills Inc., which ranks sixth.
Major companies in Japan that use Canadian wheat are Nisshin Flour Milling Inc., Nippon Flour Milling Co., Ltd., Showa Sangyo Co., Ltd. and Nitto Flour Milling Co., Ltd.
Rodgers Foods Inc., a Canadian flour-milling firm in which the Nisshin Flour Milling group holds a 90% stake, built the factory.
Canadian Position Canada continues to be Japan's leading supplier of canola, wheat, soybeans, forage, malt, and barley.
Japan has a steady annual demand of between 1.6 and 1.8 million MT of canola and over 1 million MT of wheat from Canada.
Canada is Japan's sole supplier of durum wheat.
Canada is well positioned to export food grade soybeans for the Japanese food soybean market.
Canadian suppliers have also been successful in the export of cereals and cereal products for many years.
As the Japanese food processing industries are highly concerned with food safety, Canadian companies may benefit from references to Canada's Agricultural Policy Framework, which clearly addresses food safety as a priority.
Japan is one of the most reliable markets for food crops and has consistently provided high returns to Canadian grain producers and exporters.
Canadian wheat, canola, soybeans and the other commodity products enjoy a reputation for high quality in Japan.
However, there is intense competition from US producers for wheat and soybeans, and Australia for canola and wheat.
Quality factors that can distinguish the Canadian crop from its competitors are extremely valuable for promoting the crop to buyers.
PRIVATE- AND PUBLIC-SECTOR CUSTOMERS Although the Japanese agri-food market is open for competition, Canadian exporters should be aware of the high tariffs applied to most imports of raw materials and value-added processed foods.
The Japanese food distribution system is characterized by multiple layers of distributors and wholesalers--many of whom specialize in certain products--who have developed close relationships with manufacturers, retailers, importers and other wholesalers.
Specialized distributors typically handle competing product lines and some or all related promotional activities.
Depending on the specific agreement, distributors and wholesalers may also oversee customer support.
The agricultural commodities trade in Japan is traditionally handled by large general trading companies that have tremendous influence in the Japanese food industry, even though some specialized trading companies are involved in specific sectors, such as food soybeans and organic grain products.
Each commodity sector has trade and industry associations unified to lobby their internal and external activities to governmental agencies.
For example, Japan Oilseed Processors Association is the vegetable oil crushers' organization and the Japan Flour Millers Association is the wheat flour millers' organization.
These organizations work closely with their respective trader associations, such as the Japan Oils & Fats Importers Association and the Japan Grain Importers Association.
Nevertheless, choosing the appropriate distributor is still a crucial step in accessing the Japanese market.
It is important to work closely with a Japanese partner to ensure that products meet all regulations, standards and quality conditions that are essential to operating successfully in Japan.
Producers are expected to communicate frequently with their distributor or wholesaler, which includes, generally, making one or more trips to Japan each year.
A lack of correspondence is generally interpreted as evidence of a lack of commitment and inevitably leads to mis-communication and a loss of interest by the client.
Good communication from the supplier often determines how much effort a distributor or wholesaler will put towards promoting that supplier's products.

Market Information Asia Pacific Market Brief - The Retail Grocery Market in New Zealand June 2005
The Government of Canada has prepared this report based on primary and secondary sources of information.
Readers should take note that the Government of Canada does not guarantee the accuracy of any of the information contained in this report, nor does it necessarily endorse the organizations listed herein.
Readers should independently verify the accuracy and reliability of the information.
This report is intended as a concise overview of the market for those interested in its potential and is not intended to provide in-depth analysis which may be required by the individual exporter.
New Zealand is a developed and varied market comprised of over 4 million people.
The population is diverse in culture with over 70% of the population of European origin, 8% Maori, 9% Polynesian and 4% Asian.
Two thirds of the highly urban population resides in the major centres of Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.
The retail grocery market in New Zealand is well developed with main food retailer categories such as supermarkets, small-scale grocery stores, fresh food specialty stores and convenience stores in all major population centres.
The retail grocery scene has experienced gradual increases in convenience store food sales; a representation of busy consumers and consumer lifestyles seeking ready-made food and quick-grab items.
Fresh food specialty grocery outlets are slowly decreasing in numbers as small grocery store formats as well as convenience store formats have grown 17% and 13% respectively.
Despite this the importance of fresh food and specialty food outlets within the market will remain high as the return to 'local' shopping for specialty and fresh food items is a recently observed trend.
A great challenge to expanding Canadian exports to New Zealand is the vast output of Australian multinational food companies that enter New Zealand duty-free.
This output includes production from major North American players such as Kellogg's and Campbell's.
Quick facts  New Zealand
• Population growth rate: 1.02% (2005)
• Age Structure: 0-14 years: 21%, 15-64 years: 67%, 65 years and over: 12%
• Unemployment Rate: 4.2% (2004)
• GDP real growth rate: 4.8% (2004)
• GDP per capita: purchasing power parity US$23,200
Economy New Zealand has shown strong economic development over the past few years, with the economy growing by 4.5% in 2004, making New Zealand one of the faster growing countries within the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
This growth is a reflection of increased household spending and business investment.
Household spending alone grew to a value of US$54 billion* in 2005, a 78% increase since 1990.
This spending increase is a result of a boost in goods and services available to the population, an increase in average consumer incomes as well a shift towards more refined consumer tastes.
Real GDP growth reached 4.5% in 2004, but is expected to slow to 2.5% in 2005 due to high interest rates and sluggish population growth.
New Zealand trades extensively with the UK and Australia for historical and geographical purposes.
Other significant trading partners are Japan, other South-East Asian countries and the US.
New Zealand's major exports recorded in 2003 were dairy products accounting for 16.6% of all exports, meat at 14.7% and forestry products at 7.3%.

Preface India is a signatory to WTO and an active member of Codex Alimentarius commission and other international treaties governing food trade.
Most of the India’s agriculture and food regulations are inline with international guidelines but may not be the same as their trading partners including Canada.
In most of the cases, central government can frame the laws but implementation of the law is in the hand of the state governments.
At the same time State governments are also empowered to make similar laws to address the needs of the local situations.
As far as food trade is concerned, central government has enacted large number of regulations to monitor the trade practices and quality of the food available to the citizens, the implementation and enforcement of the law is in the hand of state agencies.
There are many mandatory regulations and voluntary standards in the food trade in India.
While doing trade with India, exporters must understand various legal provisions because any product sold in India must comply with the legal provisions applicable in India.
In this document we are highlight the regulations and their approach for governing food import from Canada into India territory.
Various chapters of this document cover specific provisions affecting trade with India.
We are also providing the important website links so that while doing trade with India exporters must check the latest update on the various provisions in the law.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This Study on Indian Food Laws is prepared on the request of Canadian High Commission at New Delhi.
Great care was taken in its preparation to include the latest modifications in the laws related to food trade and biotechnology policy.
As you know policies and rules keep changing so this information may not be entirely accurate either because policies may have changed since the report was written, or because clear and consistent information is unavailable.
It is highly recommended that Canadian exporters verify import requirements with their foreign customers before goods are shipped.
Final import approval is always subject to the importing country’s rules and regulations as interpreted by border officials at the time of product entry.
Food Related Laws All notifications related to trade in food products from and into India are issued by Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT).
These notifications reflect Export – Import Policy or Trade Policy of India and also the notifications issued by various concerned departments.
It is important to understand overall Import-Export policy of India while developing trading relations with India in any sector including food products.
Currently there are more than fifteen laws relating to food, which are administered by a number of different Ministries and Departments of the Government of India.
Among the more important food laws are:
Prevention of Food Adulteration Act (PFA) of 1954 and the PFA Rules of 1955 The objective of this law to protect the nation against impure, unsafe, and fraudulently labeled foods and is amended from time to time.
PFA standards and regulations apply equally to domestic and imported products.
The PFA covers various aspects of food formulation, food processing and distribution, such as food standard, food color, preservatives, pesticide residues, packaging and labeling, and regulation of sales.
The law is enforced by the Director General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India (GOI).
The PFA focuses primarily on the establishment of regulatory standards for primary food products, which constitute the bulk of the Indian diet.
The PFA is not always able to keep pace with advances in the food processing sector because of various social and administrative issues.
PFA rules sometimes appear to be drafted in a manner to establish minimum product quality specifications, such as prescribing recipes for how food products should to be manufactured.
In case there are scientific reasons to amend the standards, the concerned parties can appeal to have the PFA Rules amendments.
Under PFA, the Central Committee for Food Standards, chaired by the Director General of Health Services, is the final decision making entity on PFA rules.
The appeals process is cumbersome and time consuming.
All imported products must adhere to the rules as specified in the regulation, including the labeling and marking requirements.
The Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1976, and Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities) Rule, 1977 These legislative measures are designed to establish fair trade practices with respect to packaged commodities.
The rules aim to ensure that the basic rights of consumers regarding vital information about the nature of the commodity, the name and address of the manufacturer, the net quantity, date of manufacture, and maximum sale price are provided on the label.
Besides Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1976, and Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities) Rule, 1977, there are additional labeling requirements for food items covered under the PFA Act and Rules.
The Department of Consumer Affairs in the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution is the regulatory authority for the Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1976, and Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities) Rule, 1977 and subsequent notifications.
Importers of packaged food products must adhere to these acts, including labeling the product.
The name and address of the importer, the net quantity, date of manufacture, best-before date, and maximum sale price must be included on the label.
The Fruit Products Order, 1955 The fruit and vegetable processing sector is regulated by the Fruit Products Order, 1955 (FPO), which is administered by the Ministry of Food Processing Industries.
The FPO contains specifications and quality control requirements regarding the production and marketing of processed fruits and vegetables, sweetened aerated water, vinegar, and synthetic syrups.
All such processing units are required to obtain a license under the FPO, and periodic inspections are carried out.
Processed fruit and vegetable products imported into the country must meet the FPO standards.
Please Note:
In case of variation in the product standard between the Fruit Products Order, 1955 and PFA Rule, the PFA rule will apply.
Meat Food Products Order, 1992 This order administers the permissible quantity of heavy metals, preservatives, and insecticide residues for meat products.
The new regulatory authority for this order is Ministry of food processing Industries.
This order is equally applicable to domestic processors and importers of meat products.
However, its implementation is weak due to unorganized production in the domestic market and few imports.
Livestock Importation Act, 1898 Under the Livestock Importation Act, 1898, the government laid down procedures for the importation of livestock and products to India, which is implemented by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Ministry of Agriculture.
Under this act, any importer importing any livestock product needs prior permission based on sanitary status of the country of origin and type of product.
Milk and Milk Products Order, 1992 This order regulates the production, distribution, and supply of milk products; establishes sanitary requirements for dairies, machinery, and premises; and sets quality control standards for milk and milk products.
Standards specified in the order also apply to imported milk products.
The Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Ministry of Agriculture, is the regulatory authority for this order.
The implementing agency is the Directorate of Plant Protection, Quarantine, and Storage, under the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation, Ministry of Agriculture.
Based on the feedback and experience this act is amended from time to time.
Labeling Requirements for Food Products Part VII of the PFA Rules, 1955, and the Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities) Rules, 1977, as amended, lay down labeling requirements for all packaged foods.
The label should provide the information related to Name, trade name or description contained in the package, Name of ingredients used in the product in descending order of their composition by weight or volume, Name and complete address of manufacturer, packer, importer, or vendor, and country of origin of the imported food (if the food article is manufactured outside India and packed in India), Net weight, number, or volume of contents, Distinctive batch, lot, or code number, Month and year the product was manufactured or packed, Month and year by which the product is best consumed, Maximum retail price (MRP).
Every package of food which contains permitted artificial sweetener shall carry the label "CONTAINS ARTIFICIAL SWEETENER AND FOR CALORIE CONSCIOUS" along with the name or trade name of the product.
There are special labeling requirements for certain packaged food items, such as infant foods, condensed milk, milk powder, blended vegetable oils, etc.
In the case of imported packaged food, all declarations: 1) may be printed on a label securely affixed to the package; or 2) may be made on an additional wrapper containing the imported package; or 3) may be printed on the package itself; or 4) may be made on a card or tape affixed firmly to the package or container and bearing the required information prior to customs clearance.
The responsibility for labeling lies with the importer and should be done before products are presented for custom clearance.
All packaged commodities imported into India should carry the following declarations:
Residual Shelf Life of the Imported Product:
Shelf life of the product is to be calculated, based on the declaration given on the label of the product, regarding the date of manufacture and the due date of expiry."
However, there are no statutory nutritional requirements.
Although there is no official position on implied and/or health claims, such claims should be able to withstand verification by a court of law, if challenged.
Packaging and Container Requirements All weights or measures are to be reported in metric units.
Imported processed foods containing coloring matter, preservatives, food additives, etc. should conform to the regulations contained in the PFA rules, 1955.
PFA Act also prohibits the sale of fresh fruits and vegetables coated with waxes (both edible and non-edible), mineral oils, and colors.
Pesticides and Other Contaminants The PFA Rules, 1955, include a positive list for the presence of pesticide residues in various commodities and food (manufactured/imported) products, and their respective tolerance levels.
The CODEX MRLs may be accepted for imported foodstuffs only for those pesticides not included in India’s positive list of pesticides.
Other Regulations and Requirements for Imported Food products Product registration is not required for imported products.
All imported foods are randomly sampled at the port of entry for their conformity to PFA standards.
The Ministry of Commerce and Industry published a list of "high risk" food items, imports of which will be subject to 100 percent sampling with immediate effect.
The list includes edible oils and fats, pulses and pulse products, cereal and cereal products, milk powder, condensed milk, food colors, and food additives, among other items.
The import of product samples via express mail or parcel post is allowed, contingent on obtaining prior permission from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade.
Mail order imports are not allowed.
Once the products enter the domestic market, they are to be monitored randomly at the retail/wholesale level by the respective regulatory authorities.
Food ingredients and additives containing bioengineered organisms, shall not be produced, used, or imported without the approval of the GEAC.
All such approvals, if granted, shall be for a specific period not exceeding four years at the first instance, and renewable for 2 years at a time, subject to terms and conditions.
Product Specific Food Standards Appendix B of The PFA Rules, 1955 and the Fruit Products Order, 1955, as amended, contain definitions and specific quality standards for certain food products, such as processed cheese, ice cream, spice mixes, milk and milk products, infant food, vegetable oils and margarine, fruits and vegetable products, and basic food items like wheat, rice, and pulses.
Mandatory BIS Certification on Sensitive Food Products:
Department of Commerce Notification No. 44 (RE-2000)/1997-2002, dated November 24, 2000, requires imports of certain products, including some food products (milk powder, condensed milk, infant milk foods, milk-cereal based weaning foods) and food additives, to comply with mandatory Indian quality standards.
All manufacturers and exporters whose products are sold in India are required to register with the Bureau of Indian Standards.
IPR Protection i.e. Copyright and/or Trademark Indian law is supposed to provide rigorous protection for copyrighted material.
The Indian Copyright Act of 1957 is based on the Bern Convention on Copyrights, to which India is a party.
May 1995 and December 1999 amendments increased protection and introduced stiff mandatory penalties for copyright infringement.
The foreign trademarks are recognized in India.
Foreign firms can register their trademarks through a local agent by applying at the office of Registrar of Trademarks.
Importers are required to furnish an import declaration in the prescribed Bill of Entry format, disclosing full details of the value of imported goods.
This must be accompanied by any import licenses and phytosanitary certificates (in case of agricultural commodities), along with documentation such as sales invoices and freight and insurance certificates.
All consignments are required to be inspected prior to clearance.
In the current Customs set-up, appointing a clearing agent avoids delays.
The clearance of imported food products at the port of entry requires a certification from the port health authority that the product conforms to the standards and regulation of the PFA or other relevant laws and rules.
However, certification is based mostly on visual inspection and records of past imports, as most ports have very limited testing facilities and storage infrastructure.
Consequently, importers of new products can sometimes face undue delays in clearing their products.
The custom clearance period may vary from one day to one month, depending on the product and experience of the importer.
Imports from Canada in to India are free unless regulated Imports from Canada shall be free, except in cases where they are regulated by the provisions of this Policy or any other law for the time being in force.
The item wise import policy shall be, as specified in Harmonized Standards for Classification i.e. ITC (HS), published and notified by Director General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), as amended from time to time.
Compliance with Laws Every exporter or importer shall comply with the provisions of the Foreign Trade (Development and Regulation) Act, 1992, the Rules and Orders made thereunder, the provisions of this Policy and the terms and conditions of any license/certificate/permission granted to him, as well as provisions of any other law for the time being in force.
All imported goods shall also be subject to domestic Laws, Rules, Orders, Regulations, technical specifications, environmental and safety norms as applicable to domestically produced goods.
Procedure The Director General of Foreign Trade may, in any case or class of cases, specify the procedure to be followed by an exporter or importer or by any licensing or any other competent authority for the purpose of implementing the provisions of the Act, the Rules and the Orders made hereunder and this Policy.
Such procedures shall be included in the Handbook (Vol.1), Handbook (Vol.2), Schedule of DEPB Rate and in ITC (HS) and published by means of a Public Notice.
Such procedures may, in like manner, be amended from time to time.
The Handbook (Vol.1) is a supplement to the Foreign Trade Policy and contains relevant procedures and other details.
The Director General of Foreign Trade may pass such orders or grant such relaxation or relief, as he may deem fit and proper.
The Director General of Foreign Trade may, in public interest, exempt any person or class or category of persons from any provision of this Policy or any procedure and may, while granting such exemption, impose such conditions as he may deem fit.
Such request may be considered only after consulting Advance Licensing Committee (ALC) and Policy Relaxation Committee.

Food Laws applicable for Food Products Import from Canada Currently there are more than fifteen laws relating to food, which are administered by a number of different Ministries and Departments.
Various laws affecting Trade with India in various categories are as follows:
• The Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954.
• The Fruit Products Order, 1955.
• The Milk and Milk Products Order, 1992.
• The Meat Food Products Order, 1973.
• The Vegetable Oil Products (Control) Order, 1947.
• The Edible Oils Packaging (Regulation) Order, 1998.
• The Solvent Extracted Oil, De-oiled Meal, and Edible Flour (Control) Order, 1967.
• The Infant Milk Substitutes, Feeding Bottles and Infant Foods (Regulation of Production, Supply, and Distribution) Act, 1992.
Any other order issued under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, relating to food
• The Standards of Weights and Measurement Act, 1976 (The Packaged Commodity Rules, 1977).

Other Acts/Orders enacted or issued by the State Governments and Union Territories.
Among the more important food laws are:
Prevention of Food Adulteration Act (PFA) of 1954 and the PFA Rules of 1955 The law to protect the nation against impure, unsafe, and fraudulently labeled foods is the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act (PFA) of 1954 and the PFA Rules of 1955, as amended from time to time.
The PFA covers various aspects of food processing and distribution, such as food color, preservatives, pesticide residues, packaging and labeling, and regulation of sales.
The law is enforced by the Director General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India (GOI).
The PFA does not always keep pace with advances in the food processing sector.
Moreover, PFA rules sometimes appear to be drafted in a manner that goes beyond the mere establishment of minimum product quality specifications, such as prescribing recipes for how food products are to be manufactured.
Concerned parties can appeal to have the PFA Rules amended.
The Central Committee for Food Standards, chaired by the Director General of Health Services, is the decision-making entity.
The appeals process, however, is cumbersome and time consuming.
All imported products must adhere to the rules as specified in the regulation, including the labeling and marking requirements.
Food Additive Regulations Information regarding permitted coloring matter, preservatives, etc., are provided in various sections of the PFA Rules, 1955, as amended, which are listed below:
• Coloring Matter Part VI
• Preservatives Part X
• Poisonous metal Part XI
• Anti-Oxidants, Emulsifying, Stabilizing and anti-caking Agents Part XII
• Flavoring agents and related Substances Part XIII
• Sequestering and buffering agents Part XVI
• Food Additives Part XIX Imported processed foods containing coloring matter, preservatives, food additives, etc. should conform to the regulations contained in the PFA rules, 1955.
On August 13, 2003, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued a final Gazette notification under the PFA Act, prohibiting the sale of fresh fruits and vegetables coated with waxes (both edible and non-edible), mineral oils, and colors.
Pesticides and Other Contaminants The PFA Rules, 1955, include a positive list for the presence of pesticide residues in various commodities and food (manufactured/imported) products, and their respective tolerance levels.
Of the 181 pesticides registered for regular use in India, only 71 pesticides listed in Part XIV of PFA Rules have MRLs notified.
For an additional 50 pesticides, MRLs are finalized and draft notifications have been issued.
There are 27 pesticides that do not require MRLs.
For the remaining 33 pesticides, MRLs have not yet been established.
"High Risk" Foods Requirements Product registration is not required for imported products.
All imported foods are randomly sampled at the port of entry for their conformity to PFA standards.
The import of product samples via express mail or parcel post is allowed, contingent on obtaining prior permission from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade.
Mail order imports are not allowed.
Once the products enter the domestic market, they are to be monitored randomly at the retail/wholesale level by the respective regulatory authorities.
General notes regarding import policy of ITC (HS) for Classifications of Export and Import Items, 2002-2007, reference is invited to Policy Circular No. 25 (RE-2003)/2002-07 dated 28.1.2004 regarding 100% sampling of edible/food products under the PFA Act, the list of High risk food items is as under: 1.
Edible Oils and Fats in any form 2. Pulses and Pulses products 3. Cereals and Cereal Products 4. Milk powders 5. Condensed Milks 6. Infant Milk Food 7. Milk Cereal Base Weaning Foods 8. Infant Formulae 9. Food Colours 10. Food Additives 11. Natural Mineral Water 12. Packaged drinking water 13 Tea & Coffee 14. Cocoa butter equivalent or Substitutes The Standards of Weights and Measures Act, 1976, and Standards of Weights and Measures (Packaged Commodities) Rule, 1977 These legislative measures are designed to establish fair trade practices with respect to packaged commodities.
The rules aim to ensure that the basic rights of consumers regarding vital information about the nature of the commodity, the name and address of the manufacturer, the net quantity, date of manufacture, and maximum sale price are provided on the label.
There may be additional labeling requirements for food items covered under the PFA.
The Department of Consumer Affairs in the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution is the regulatory authority.
Importers of packaged food products must adhere to these acts, including labeling the product.
The Fruit Products Order, 1955 The fruit and vegetable processing sector is regulated by the Fruit Products Order, 1955 (FPO), which is administered by the Department of Food Processing Industries.
The FPO contains specifications and quality control requirements regarding the production and marketing of processed fruits and vegetables, sweetened aerated water, vinegar, and synthetic syrups.
All such processing units are required to obtain a license under the FPO, and periodic inspections are carried out.
Processed fruit and vegetable products imported into the country must meet the FPO standards.
Meat Food Products Order, 1992 This order administers the permissible quantity of heavy metals, preservatives, and insecticide residues for meat products.
Ministry of Food Processing Industry is the new regulatory authority.
However, its implementation is weak due to unorganized production in the domestic market and few imports.
Livestock Importation Act, 1898 Under the Livestock Importation Act, 1898, the government laid down procedures for the importation of livestock and products to India, which is implemented by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Ministry of Agriculture.
Milk and Milk Products Order, 1992 This order regulates the production, distribution, and supply of milk products; establishes sanitary requirements for dairies, machinery, and premises; and sets quality control standards for milk and milk products.
Regulations on GMOs The Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) is the decisionmaking authority on allowing imports of bioengineered products.
Food ingredients and additives containing bioengineered organisms, shall not be produced, used, or imported without the approval of the GEAC.
All such approvals, if granted, shall be for a specific period not exceeding four years at the first instance, and renewable for 2 years at a time, subject to terms and conditions.
Mandatory Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) Certification According to the Department of Commerce Notification No. 44 (RE- 2000)/1997-2002, dated November 24, 2000, requires imports of certain products, including some food products (milk powder, condensed milk, infant milk foods, milk-cereal based weaning foods) and food additives, to comply with mandatory Indian quality standards.
All manufacturers and exporters whose products are sold in India are required to register with the Bureau of Indian Standards.
However, the enforcement of this regulation has been very lax, as current import volumes of these products have been small (mostly in mixed containers).
Specific Standards for Various Foods The PFA Rules, 1955 (Appendix B), and the Fruit Products Order, 1955, as amended, contain definitions and specific quality standards for certain food products, such as processed cheese, ice cream, spice mixes, milk and milk products, infant food, vegetable oils and margarine, fruits and vegetable products, and basic food items like wheat, rice, and pulses.
Imported products must also meet the specified quality standards.
Customs Clearance of Processed Foods from Canada Once the product has arrived at Indian ports for clearance, authorities to give the clearance for the product from Canada, they have to follow procedure.
All the consignments of edible/food products imported through ports, airports, ICDs, CFSs, Land Custom Stations shall be referred to PHOs for testing and clearance and shall be allowed only after receipt of the test report.
Pending receipt of test report, such consignments may be allowed to be stored in warehouses under section 49 of the Customs Act, 1962.
If the product fails the test, the Customs authorities will ensure that the goods are re-exported out of the country by following the usual adjudication procedure or destroyed as required under the relevant rules.
As regards ICDs/CFSs/ports/airports/LCSs, where Port Health Officers are not available, the Customs shall draw the samples and get these tested from the nearest Central Food Laboratory or a laboratory authorised for such testing by the Directorate General of Health Services. 4.
The Customs shall also develop a database regarding importers and import sources and products which are found to consistently fail the tests and give some feedback on the nature of the shortcomings noted to the Director General of Health Services (DGHS) to serve as input for policy formulation.
In addition to testing of food items under the PFA Act, 1954, these items shall also be subject to examination/testing to ensure compliance of the requirements of other Acts, regulations and orders such as Meat Food Products Order, 1973, Plants, Fruits and Seeds (Regulation of Import into India) Order, 1989, the Livestock Importation Act, etc. for the time being in force if these are also covered by these Acts/orders, before these are allowed clearance into the country.

Despite significant development challenges Pakistan’s economy has been steadily growing for the past 6 years, and it has the highest annual growth rate in South Asia.
Much of Pakistan’s economic success can be attributed to the country’s thriving agriculture sector, as well as the prosperous textile industry.
The textile industry not only provides 68% of Pakistan’s exports, but also aids Pakistan’s agriculture sector as almost all the cotton used in textile manufacturing is produced domestically.
Canada - Pakistan Relations In 1996 Canada strengthened it relations with Pakistan by signing six agreements that sought to improve air services and lead to greater co-operation in areas such as environment, trade, agriculture, and justice.
The signing of the agreements displayed Canada’s confidence in the opportunities being created by economic reform in Pakistan and a commitment to fostering a full economic partnership with Pakistan.
Canada and Pakistan maintain a strong relationship rooted in the fact that both countries belong to the commonwealth.
In the 1990’s Canada shifted its focus on relations with Pakistan from aid to trade.
Former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien led the biggest delegation from the G-7/8 countries to visit Pakistan to strengthen relationships.
Canada’s 2005 International Market Access Priorities outline distinct initiatives with Pakistan such as, promoting the acceptance of wheat specifications, and to monitor the Pakistani government’s agenda for infrastructure development.
Canada/Pakistan trade totaled US$442 million in 2004.
Traditionally Canada’s agri-food exports to Pakistan have averaged $30 million.
In the past five years exports have been affected by shifting requirement in the Pakistani market, diversification of Canada’s exports and large one time commodity shipments.
Beginning in 2000 Canada’s agri-food exports experienced a 3 year period of decline.
In 2000 Canada’s exports to Pakistan were valued at $26 million a slight decrease over traditional levels.
The following year witnessed an additional $4 million decrease, and 2002 saw Canadian exports fall to a period low of $13.6 million.
In addition 2003 witnessed a one time large shipment of Canola seeds worth $165 million which increased total Canadian agricultural exports to Pakistan to over $200 million.
2004 saw a continuation of the diversification of Canada’s exports to Pakistan enabling totals to achieve a period high when the one time shipment of Canola seeds in 2003 is factored out.
In the first 6 months of 2005 Canadian exports are again on pace to surpass traditional levels based continuation of export diversification and a return to the export of wheat.
Canada imports from Pakistan have been steadily increasing for the past 5 years, in 2004 Canada’s agri-food imports from Pakistan were valued at $16 million.
Pakistan is Canada’s 4th largest supplier of rice, in 2004 50% of Canada’s agri-food imports from Pakistan was comprised of various varieties of rice.
• Total Pakistan/Canada agricultural trade was valued at over $63.2 million in 2004 and represented over 14% of all trade between the two countries.
Top Canadian exports to Pakistan in 2004 were canola seeds, valued at $17.8 million accounting for nearly 40% of agri-food exports, and dried peas at $16.5 million or 35.3% of total agricultural exports.
Top Canadian imports from Pakistan in 2004 were varieties of rice, valued at $8.5 million, accounting for 50% of all agricultural imports from Pakistan, followed by mucilages valued at $1 million representing 6.5% of all agri-food imports.
Pakistan imports large quantities of palm oil and cotton; these key exportable commodities represent an opportunity for Canadian exporters.
Demand for these products is steadily increasing.
Other commodities representing an opportunity for Canadian exporters are: processed fruits and vegetables, snack foods, tree nuts, and dairy products, as well as, wheat, health foods and processed food products.
Pakistan Country Report:
Economy Despite being hampered with problems such as severe drought, declining commodity prices and the increasing price of oil; recent trends have shown that Pakistan’s economic performance is improving.
This is the result of the government implementing a comprehensive macroeconomic stabilization policy in 2000, which includes significant large scale expansion of the manufacturing industry.
Pakistan’s domestic and external debt, as well as, fiscal debt and inflation are declining as a result of these policies.
The government has also made reducing poverty one of its main initiatives.
Pakistan’s economy is extremely dependent on it’s textile industry.
Textiles account for 68% of Pakistan’s exports and employ 40% of the labour force.
The removal of the limits set by the MFA has resulted in the re-organization of trade since January 2005, and out of all the major textile producing countries Pakistan posted the highest growth rate since the end of the MFA.
The textile industry also serves a dual purpose by using domestically produced cotton and strengthening the country’s agricultural industry.
Gross Domestic Product (2004) GDP GDP (purchasing power parity) GDP/ capita GDP/capita (purchasing power parity) GDP growth US$89 billion US$347 billion US$570 US$2200 5.7% (2004), 6.7% (2005)
Current
• Current unemployment rate of 9%
• Unemployment rate decreased from 9.3% to 9% between 2003 and 2004.
• GDP growth rate has been steadily increasing for the past 5 years from 2.70% in 2001 to over 6% in 2005.
Forecast:
• Pakistan has taken an active role in the "war against terrorism", which is expected to strengthen their relationship with other countries involved in the initiative, which include the US, and Britain.
The US is currently Pakistan’s largest export market, and Pakistan’s assistance in the war against terrorism will help maintain their strong relationship.
• GDP is expected to increase by 6.7% in 2005.
• The current unemployment rate of 9% is expected to fall to 8.5% by 2009
• The female employment rate is expected to slowly increase in the coming years, as more women join the work force.
Consumer Market Pakistan Country Report:
A large portion (97%) of the country is of the Muslim faith.
For religious reasons there is little to no consumer base for pork products and alcoholic beverages, and they are prohibited from being imported.
It is important to people of the Muslim faith to consume meat that is "halal", which is meat that has been slaughtered in the manner described by the Shari’a.
Due to these particular requirements the majority of Pakistani consumers prefer to consume domestic meat over meat imported from non-islamic countries as standards of "halal" meat may not be as strict in other countries.
For more information on halal food products please visit http://ats-sea.agr.gc.ca/africa/e3281.htm
Competitors Pakistan is not a member of any free trade arrangement, but is a member of the World Trade Organization.
Pakistan is party to arrangements designed to achieve progress toward regional liberalization of trade under such organizations as: the Economic Cooperation Organization, which grants 10% tariff preference on statutory rates for some goods.
Pakistan is also involved with the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), which operates under the South Asian Preferential Trading Agreement (SAPTA).
In 2003 the UAE provided 11.2% of Pakistan’s total imports followed by Saudi Arabia at 10.9% and China at 7.3%.
Dutch, German, and French suppliers provide Pakistan with the bulk of consumer food items.
Only a select number of retailers and processors have the ability to import foreign products directly.
Most retailers obtain foreign goods from wholesalers or brokers.
The aid of a local representative is highly recommended to help understand the complex product and import regulations.
The food import business is dominated by small commercial importers, who sell containers or cases of each product to brokers or wholesalers.
Access Issues In recent years Pakistan has eased trade barriers to attract more foreign investment.
As part of the trend to increase foreign investment import regulations have become increasingly transparent, and tariffs have been reduced.
• Tariffs have been reduced to a rate between 10-25%.
A sales tax of 15% is added on top of the tariffs on imported consumer foods.
There are certain items which Pakistan prohibits from importing which include: items banned for religious reasons, capital and consumer goods banned to protect domestic industry, intermediate goods used in producing protected goods, products and by-products of pigs/hogs/boars.
More than half of Pakistan consumer food imports are not officially reported.
Importers are required to obtain special authorization from the Ministry of Commerce to import items on the negative/restricted list.
Goods are required to be imported under a Compulsory Letter of Credit (L/C) or under a contract which must be registered with a bank.
Pakistan uses the Harmonized System to classify and describe goods, while customs duties are levied on an ad valorem basis.

Agriculture Sector & Policies Much of Pakistan’s economic success is attributed to it’s thriving agricultural sector, which accounts for approximately 25% of the country’s GDP and employs 48% of the labour force.
A vital crop for the Pakistan agriculture industry is cotton, the bulk of which is grown in the Punjab province.
In an attempt to boost the economy, the government is allocating more land for cotton production in the hopes of increasing production by 25% by 2010.
•
In 2002 the government initiated a major irrigation project to repair and replace the current dilapidated system that farmers rely on.
The project has faced several delays, but when finished it will increase the crop production of many farms in the country.
The local food processing industry relies heavily on imported ingredients to meet domestic demands.
Pakistan’s most cultivated areas are the Indus River plain in Punjab and Sindh.

Agri-Food Past, Present & Future Report Bangladesh August 2005
Although every effort has been made to ensure that the information is correct, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada assumes no responsibility for its accuracy, reliability, or for any decisions arising from the information contained herein.
Bryan West westb@agr.gc.ca
Bangladesh Past Present & Future Report August 2005 Overview Bangladesh accommodates a large population of 145 million people with a growing middle class with mounting demand for assorted products and services.
Bangladesh is rich in natural resources, and has a thriving agricultural sector that dominates the economy.
During the early 90’s Bangladesh embarked on an economic stabilization program which has since made strides in improving economic stability and possibility.
As economic improvements continue, Bangladesh can rely on its endowments of a vast human resources base, rich land, abundance of water and considerable natural gas reserves to carry it through this slow but steady development process.
Bangladesh has also made improvements in its standards of living.
Other notable advancements include, reducing population growth, gender equality within the school system, and improvement of the health care system.
Annual GDP growth has remained steady in past years, although it is estimated that growth needs to expand by at least two percentage points to significantly reduce the poverty that afflicts many residents.
Canada - Bangladesh Relations Canada has maintained a strong relationship with Bangladesh since it gained independence in 1971.
In 1999 Bangladesh was the top Asian recipient of Canadian aid.
In January of 2003, the Canadian government granted virtually open market access to Bangladesh which resulted in a significant increase of Bangladesh's exports destined for Canada.
The Canadian presence in Bangladesh is growing as Canadian companies are realizing the opportunities that exist within this market.
Canadian companies have already made their mark in gas exploration and telecommunication, as well as management and consultancy fields Canada-Bangladesh (2004) Bangladesh Total Trade Exports Imports Trade balance
US$11.8 billion US$4.8 billion US$7 billion (US$2.2 billion)
Both imports from Bangladesh and Canadian exports to Bangladesh doubled between 2002 and 2003.
Canada/Bangladesh total trade has been steadily increasing in the past few years.
In 2002 trade totaled US$149 million, it more than doubled in 2003 at a value of US$343 and in 2004 it was valued at US$462 million.
Top Canadian exports to Bangladesh are vegetables, cereals, and iron and steel.
The years 1999 through 2001 saw record agri-food exports from Canada to Bangladesh based on the strength of dried pea exports.
However, exports dropped dramatically after 2001 seeing a 50% decline in 2002.
Canada’s agri-food exports rebound from the 2002 total of $53 million to reach $84 million in 2003, but there was a slight drop in 2004 to $70.4 million due to a large decrease in lentil exports.
These fluctuations reflect the changing needs of the Bangladeshi market more than external competit ion.
While 2004 did see a decrease there were some positive aspects to the statistical totals.
Canada’s largest agri-food export commodity has consistently been wheat, accounting for over $20 million in each of the past 3 years.
Canada is Bangladesh’s 7th largest wheat supplier.
Imports from Bangladesh although aggregately small, have been steadily increasing from $292,000 in 2002 to $558,000 in 2004.
Complete Statistical Trade Summary available at: http://ats.agr.gc.ca/stats/bangladesh_e.pdf
• Total Bangladesh/Canada agricultural trade was valued at over $70 million in 2004, and represented over 15% of total trade between the two countries.
2004 Canadian bulk exports to Bangladesh totaled $34 million or 48% of all Canadian agri-food exports to Bangladesh, in the same year intermediate exports totaled $36.5 million or 51% and consumer oriented exports totaled $29,000 or approximately 1%.
The country is trying to diversify it’s economy, and stray away from dependence on the agriculture sector.
Currently the agriculture sector employs two thirds of the country’s labour force, and accounts for 35% of GDP.
The Bangladeshi government has a strong relationship with the World Bank, which is helping to improve basic infrastructure within the country.
Cotton textiles are equally vital to Bangladesh’s economy; they currently make up 80% of the country’s exports.
In its attempt to diversify the economy, the government is placing emphasis on developing the industrial sector.
Current
• The UN has set out a stringent GDP US$59.4 billion initiative in the Millennium Development Goals (MDG’s) aimed GDP (purchasing power US$257 billion to reduce the world’s poverty by half parity) by 2015, and latest observations GDP/Capita US$349 show that Bangladesh is on track to GDP/Capita (purchasing US$2000 meet these goals. power parity)
• Bangladesh welcomes foreign investment and foreign direct investment with the aim of improving infrastructure, energy and export-oriented manufacturing.
• Bangladesh has small reserves of oil and coal, but potentially very large natural gas resources.
• The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), which is part of the World Bank Group, is helping to increase foreign investment in Bangladesh by providing guarantees in the improvement of manufacturing and financial infrastructure.
• Bangladesh’s 20,000 non-governmental organizations (NGO) are amongst the most active in the world.
They operate throughout the country and focus on poverty alleviation and development.
• Half the population lives above the poverty line.
Bangladesh Country Report:
August 2005
Other highly populated cities include Chittagong and Rajshahi.
Dhaka and Chittagong are by far the largest consumer markets in the country.
About 22% of the urban population is considered middle class, capable of purchasing processed and imported foods, and this class is growing.
The middle class has an average household income of US$3,254.
• In rural Bangladesh, rice i a staple component of the diet, and often eaten at s every meal.
The rural population does not consume processed/imported foods.
The demand for processed foods in urban areas is rapidly increasing.
A large number of foreigners reside in Dhaka and other metropolitan areas in Bangladesh and make up a large portion of the consumer base for imported fresh and processed items.
The majority of the population prefers fresh food items that are cooked at home.
Consumption of pulses has been rapidly increasing and the current domestic supply is not meeting demand.
This presents an opportunity for Canadian exporters.
Bangladesh imports approximately US$50 million of fresh and dry fruit per year as they are popular items amongst Bangladeshi consumers.
Bangladeshi’s consume a lot of chicken, beef, mutton and fish, but they are only self sufficient in poultry production.
Bangladesh is a Muslim dominated society and therefore imported meat will not be consumed unless it is "halal".
The Bangladeshi consumer base is considered to be price sensitive; however, they are increasingly quality conscious.
Bangladesh is a major importer of wheat as it is part of their staple diet, and th imports about 3.3 million tones annually.
Canada is current ly Bangladesh 7 largest import supplier of wheat, but opportunity exists for Canada to export more as projections for increased consumption are projected into 2030.
There are many types of retail shops in Bangladesh, the most common are the small roadside shops, followed by municipal corporation markets which are mainly found in semi urban or urban areas.
Supermarkets are growing in popularity but are fairly new to Bangladesh’s retail sector, with the first outlet opening only 5 years go.
Supermarkets are concentrated in major cities, and carry a variety of imported products.
August 2005
Competitors Canada’s largest competition for the Bangladeshi market comes from India, Bangladesh’s largest agri-food import supplier.
Their relationship was made stronger with the signing of a trade agreement in June 2005 in which both countries agreed to remove existing trade barriers.
Bangladesh participated in this agreement largely to address the US$1 billion trade deficit they have with India.
Bangladesh is also a member of the South Asia Free Trade Agreement, which created a free trade zone between India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan and the Maldives.
Aside from neighboring countries Canada’s western competition for the Bangladesh agrifood market come s from Australia, US, Italy and the UK.
These countries already have a strong trade relationship with Bangladesh and are large suppliers of fruit juices, powdered milk, fresh and dried fruits, olive oil and coffee to Bangladesh.
The main consumers for goods imported from western countries is the middle class and the foreign population, while neighboring countries cater to the rural population, and therefore the two markets do not compete directly.
Bangladesh is a founding member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) where it is active in representing the interests of the least developed countries in the world and Bangladesh is also a member of good standing in the South Asia Preferential Trade agreement (SAPTA).
As well Bangladesh is a member of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) an organization that seeks to promote economic cooperation between Bangladesh, India, Burma (Myanmar), Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
Bangladesh’s other large agri-food suppliers include Singapore at 13% and Australia at 7%.
• Tariff rates have been significantly reduced but as they are a major source of government revenue they are still fairly high.
Poor infrastructure makes the shipping of fresh and refrigerated products to Bangladesh difficult All plants, seeds and livestock require certificates of health issued by an approved authority from the country of origin.
The government is attempting to diversify the economy and move towards a market oriented economy to avoid heavy reliance on a sector that is typically vulnerable to natural disasters, such as cyclones, droughts and floods.
Producing enough food to sustain Bangladesh’s growing economy is a major goal of the agriculture sector, as Bangladesh still relies on imports to meet domestic demands especially during years when yields are inadequate.
A persistent problem in Bangladesh’s agricultural sector is in the ownership of land.
Islamic heritage laws have affected land division making landholdings increasingly small and often split between different areas.
This division and separation has made maximizing production difficult.
Some farmers have faced problems with the current irrigation system as at times the water supply is contaminated.
Bangladesh farmers depend on imported seeds for agricultural products, and there is a particularly high demand for hybrid seeds.
Bangladesh’s agricultural sector is legislated by the government and thus fluctuates with domestic production and changing import requirements.
The government does not plan to reform or restructure the agriculture sector in the near future.
Bangladesh’s major crops include: rice, jute, tea, wheat, cane, oilseeds, potatoes, beef, milk, poultry, tobacco, pulses, and spices.
Bangladesh is the world’s largest producer of jute.
United Arab Emirates, the US, and the United Kingdom are Bangladesh’s largest export market for agri-food products.

This program can have a major positive influence on Chinese acceptance of Canadian food products and increase the probabilities of finding opportunities in Chinese markets.
With an area of 9,498,766 Km2 2, it is the third largest country in the world by area after Russia (17,075,200 Km2) and Canada (9,984,670 Km2).
It stretches north to Russia and Mongolia, west to Pakistan and Kyrghzstan and South to Myanmar and Laos (See Figure 7).
The Northern Region The Northern region of China extends from the Mongolian Steppe on the north to the Yangtze River on the south.
The Bo Hai Gulf and the Yellow Sea form the eastern edge of the region and the Tibetan Plateau forms the western edge.
This region includes: the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin; the provinces of Shandong and Shanxi; most of the provinces of Hebei, Henan and Shaanxi and; portions of the Ningxia Autonomous Region, Jiangsu, Anhui and Gansu provinces.
The agriculturally rich Northern region has been populated for thousands of years and the land has been extensively terraced and cultivated.
Land between the mountains have been developed for cultivation.
The region includes China’s primary coal reserves and significant petroleum deposits offshore in the Bo Hai Gulf.
Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Sichuan and Guizhou provinces; the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau; most of the Guangxi Autonomous Region; the southern portions of Jiangsu, Anhui and Henan provinces and; the northern parts of Fujian, Guangdong and Yunnan provinces.
The Yangtze valley is a series of fertile alluvial basins with many natural and man-made waterways and lakes.
To the west, the Sichuan Basin is intensively cultivated by terraced farms.
The Yunnan Plateau is bordered by a series of mountain ranges with deep, steep-walled gorges.
The provinces of Guizhou and Guangxi have some very scenic landscapes where the limestone rock has been weathered into towering domes, pillar-like peaks and other strange shapes.
East of this area are the Nan Ling hills which are mostly deforested and eroded.
The southeast coast of China is rugged with many bays and offshore islands providing good natural harbours.
Fertile alluvial valleys border numerous rivers found in the region.
The Tropical Southern Region This is China’s smallest natural region and consists of a relatively thin stretch of land lying southwest of the Pearl River delta.
It extends west along the coast of the South China Sea and continues along the border with neighbouring countries of Southeast Asia.
The region is characterized by luxuriant tropical vegetation and a warm humid climate.
The terrain is mountainous and hilly throughout the region but tends to be lower in the east.
The Inner Mongolian Grassland Region The Inner Mongolian Grassland stretches along the China - Mongolia border from the Helan Shan mountains in the west to the Da Hinggan Ling in the east.
Traditionally, the southern boundary of the region is the Great Wall.
The region includes the following political divisions: the Ningxia Autonomous Region; most of the Inner Mongolia (Nei Mongol) Autonomous Region and; the extreme northern portion of Hebei Province.
The region includes the portion of the Mongolian steppe that lies within China.
A grassy plain extends from northern China into Mongolia but much of the region is desert covered by rock and sand supporting virtually no vegetation.
The region has large coal reserves.
The Northwestern Region The Northwest Region of China is bounded on the east by the Inner Mongolian Grasslands and on the west by China’s northwest border.
On the south, the region is bounded by the northern edge of the Tibetan Plateau and on the north by the national border.
In a deep basin nestled in the mountains is the smaller Turpan Pendi.
The basins are mainly fertile steppe soils with irrigated agriculture.
The Tibetan Plateau Region3 This region occupies the southwestern part of China and consists of the high mountain area known as the Tibetan Plateau or Qing Zang Gaoyuan.
The political divisions in this region include: the Tibet Autonomous Region; Qinghai Province; parts of Sichuan, Yunnan and Gansu provinces and; part of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region.
The Qaidam Pendi lies in the transition zone where the Plateau merges with a depression containing the northwestern steppe and desert.
This large depression extends from east to west and consists of mountains, hills, stony and sandy deserts, desert basins that periodically fill with water and salt marshes.
B. Demography The population of China is estimated to be 1,291,496,022 (2003).
An exponential trend line fitted to the population data from 1992 to 2003 indicates an annual rate of increase of 0.85%.

Cooking techniques used in preparing Chinese food can be identified as: cold dish; deep-frying; hotpot boiling; roasting; simmering; steaming; stewing and; stir-frying.
Examples of each cuisine with ingredients that could be supplied by Canada are provided in Table A1-4.
Religions and Philosophies China has a wide diversity of religions and philosophies.
The more important are Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, Taoism and Confucianism.
Other religions found in the country include Shamanism and the Dongba religion of the Nixa people.
Every religion and philosophy has made contributions to the cuisines of China and Taoism was the basis for traditional Chinese medicine.
Islam’s Halal food rules have allowed a religiously identifiable cuisine or method of preparation, to be maintained.
Of China’s 56 ethnic groups, 10 are followers of Islam.
Table 1 indicates the sizes of these groups and their locations.
With an Islamic population of 17.6 million people (other sources estimate the Islamic population of China as over 37 million5) China represents a potential market for Halal food.
At present China tends to be more of an exporter of Halal food rather than an importer but Canadian exporters should monitor this market with a view to future access.
The market exists but is located primarily in the far western province of Xinjiang requiring significant transportation costs.
At present, incomes may not be high enough to provide a significant effective demand for the high quality - high priced products needed to justify the transportation costs.

CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight):
The landed value of merchandise at the first port of arrival in the importing country.
It is computed by adding "Import Charges" to the "Customs Value" and therefore excludes import duties.
FOB (Free On Board):
The value of exports as they are moved onto the ship at the port of export.
The buyer bears all costs and risks of loss of or damage to the goods from that point.
The FOB term requires the seller to clear the goods for export.
This term is used only for sea or inland waterway transport.
For other modes of transport the FCA (Free Carrier) term should be used.

Toronto Estimated Transit Time & Distance Frequency (Time Between Departures)
In many areas it has reached international standards; however, the demand for services is increasing rapidly and in other areas the capacity is still inadequate and the quality does not yet meet international standards. a) Railway It is reported7 that in 2003, China had 94,240 km of railroad tracks: 68,000 km of standard gauge (1.435 m) rail tracks of which 18,668 km were electrified; 3,600 km of narrow gauge (1.0 m and 0.75 m local industrial lines) rail track and 22,640 km of dual gauge tracks.
The remaining 1,088,494 km were unpaved.
Between 1990 and 2000, highway milage increased 36 percent and existing highways were greatly improved.
c) Inland Waterways Between 1990 and 2000, China’s inland waterways increased by 9 percent.
China has an inland waterway system comprising more than 5,600 navigable rivers and a total navigable length of 119,000 km.
It is the most developed inland waterway transportation subsector in Asia.
The majority of the country’s total length of navigable waterways is located within the courses of the Yangtze, Pearl, Huaihe, and Helongjiang rivers.
The Yangtze (with its tributaries) alone has a navigable length of 58,000 km, or 50 per cent of the national total, of which 3,000 km is suitable for navigation by vessels of 1,000 dwt or more.
In addition to the major rivers, there is the ancient Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, with a current navigable length of 1,747 km, but which is expanding annually as a result of channel regulation works.
Within the waterway network there are about 2,000 inland ports, including 85 leading ports which provide 52 berths capable of accommodating vessels of up to deadweight tonnage of 10,000.
Seven of these ports each have an annual cargo throughput of at least 10 million tons.
China is concentrating its inland waterway development in five specific areas, namely, Yangtze River, Pearl River, Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta.
In a proposed development in Hunan province, a USD 100 million World Bank loan is being directed towards a USD 220 million project aimed at bringing a greater hope for prosperity to a region where 6 million people live at subsistence level.
A large part of these funds
are for the provision of power generating dams, by-passing ship locking systems and a deeper waterway throughout the system permitting large vessels to undertake trade.
On the Yangtze (which moves 80 per cent of the country’s inland waterway traffic) the huge commercial and infrastructure growth taking place around Shanghai - and the vast Three Gorges project (essentially to improve electric power) well upstream will completely change the scale of permissible vessel movement - above and below the dam - and opportunities for the movement of freight and people.
The project includes the construction of the world’s largest ship lock.
The shiplock has two lines and five steps each line.
The average vessel size is growing; it increased by 36 per cent between 1995 and 1999.
Under the new air pact, airlines will also be allowed to combine two points in Mainland China in one service and enter into code-share arrangement on all routes between the Hong Kong SAR and Mainland China.9
The government says it will intensify efforts to stimulate growth through spending on infrastructure - such as water supply and power grids - and poverty relief and through rural tax reform.
Accession to the World Trade Organization helps strengthen China’s ability to maintain strong growth rates but at the same time puts additional pressure on the hybrid system of strong political controls and growing market influences.
China’s growing openness to the world economy and the development of port services in many other coastal cities has increased the competitive pressure on the service industries of the Hong Kong SAR.
Per capita GDP of the Hong Kong SAR compares well with that of the major economies of Western Europe.
GDP growth averaged a strong 5% per year between 1989-1997, but the Hong Kong SAR suffered two recessions in the past 6 years because of the Asian financial crisis in 1998 and the global downturn of 2001-2002.
The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak also battered the Hong Kong SAR's economy, but a boom in tourism from the mainland, a return of consumer confidence, and a solid rise in exports resulted in the resumption of strong growth in late 2003.13 c) The Macau SAR Macau's relatively affluent economy has remained one of the most open in the world since its reversion to China in 1999.
Macau’s net exports of goods and services account for roughly 41% of its GDP with tourism and apparel exports as the mainstays.
Although the Macau SAR was hit hard by the 1998 Asian financial crisis and the global downturn in 2001, its economy grew 9.5% in 2002.
A rapid rise in the number of mainland visitors drove the recovery.
Much of Macau's textile industry may move to the mainland as the Multi-Fiber Agreement is phased out and the SAR may have to rely more on gambling and trade-related services to generate growth.
Determinants of Food Demand Quantitatively, the rate of increase in the demand for agricultural, agri-food & seafood products is influenced by the rates of change of: population, product prices, income per person and changes in income distribution.
Table 9 compares China as a whole with the Hong Kong and Macau SARs with respect to population growth and GDP per person.
Qualitatively, the types of products demanded by consumers are determined by their tastes and preferences which are in turn determined by the historical cuisine and their knowledge and acceptance of foreign cuisines.
Income level also has an influence on the level of quality demanded. a) China In China as a whole, population is increasing at about the same low rate as in the Hong Kong and Macau SARs but the size of the population is much larger.
The level of income inequality on an individual basis is measured by the Gini15 ratio of 44 (2002) (compared to Canada 31.5 (1994)).
The size of the population and the rate at which GDP per person is increasing indicates that China as a whole is a major consumer of food and per capita consumption will increase rapidly. b) The Hong Kong SAR The Hong Kong SAR has a small population compared to China as a whole and it is growing at about the same rate.
However, it has a much higher GDP per person than China as a whole.
Due to competition from other Chinese cities, the Hong Kong SAR’s GDP per person is actually decreasing and food consumption per person will probably not increase significantly. c) The Macau SAR The Macau SAR is a very small market but has characteristics that may be of interest to some Canadian food exporters.
GDP per person is increasing slower than China as a whole and would not be an attractive target for most Canadian food exporters.
Table 9.
Similarly high levels of technology and modern management skills in food processing are not widespread.
From January 2002 to May 2005, the value of the HKD was decreasing at a rate of -0.747% per month (-8.61% per year).
This drop in value is making Canadian food products increasingly expensive for Hong Kong consumers.
RISK FACTORS A. Internal Political/Economic Events The new political class, referred to as the fourth generation of politicians is expected to give stability to China through 2010.
It is expected to pursue a policy of gradual opening and modernization of the country which aims at maintaining economic growth and narrowing the large wealth gaps between the eastern and western areas of China.
Risk to Canadian agri-food & seafood exporters will increase if the country is not able to resolve these issues and if the difficulties of the past continue: excessively manipulative bureaucracy, payment difficulties, trade barriers (tariff and non-tariff).
In recent years the Chinese economy has been growing very quickly.
In the year ending June 2004 the country’s GDP grew at 9.6%.
Early in 2004, investment was increasing at 35% per year and bank lending has been rising very quickly.
These conditions are fuelling a property 24
If a major inflation occurs, China’s imports will not increase at the same rate as in recent years and may actually decrease.
In this event, Canadian agri-food & seafood exporters may experience a lack of effective demand in China in the next few years.
B. External Political/Economic Events The external risk factors are linked to two issues: i) China’s relations with the USA and; ii) the effect of epidemics.
Income from tourism was lost, trade exhibitions and business meetings etc. were cancelled.
Such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic"16.
Such a pandemic is likely to begin in Asia and China might be severely affected, resulting in losses similar to those experienced during the concern over SARS.
This insurance normally covers the standard risks involved in transporting goods, such as accidents and weather.
If a Canadian exporter expects to incur costs or receive payment in CNYs or HKDs he/she may want to consider hedging against currency risks by participating in the futures market.
This strategy is not appropriate in all situations and the exporter should obtain advice from a bank or other trusted expert.
The availability, terms and costs of this insurance will depend on conditions in the importing country, the reputation of the importer and EDC policy.
Generally the Accounts Receivable Insurance will cover up to 90% of losses resulting from a wide range of commercial and political risks including: insolvency or default of the buyer; payment delay caused by blockage of funds or transfer difficulties; refusal of goods by the buyer (provided you meet the contract terms); war or hostilities in the buyer’s country, or between two or more other countries and; cancellation or non-renewal of export or import permits.
Optional coverage includes: protection against contract cancellation by the buyer; insurance for Letters of Credit transactions on a country-by-country basis; coverage for sales made by foreign affiliates; invoicing in foreign currency and; insurance for receivables generated by providing services.

CONCLUSIONS In the not too distant past, China was a difficult market to access and do business in.
It is still not an easy market but many barriers to trade are being removed.
The accession of China to the WTO and internal changes such as the increasing importance of the private sector and the privatization of some state owned companies are producing considerable wealth in the eastern parts of the country.
This increased economic activity coupled with China’s large population is creating a very significant market for all types of products including agricultural, agri-food & seafood products.
With the introduction of modern methods of production and processing, China has the potential to be a large producer of food products.
Its own population will be the major consumers of China’s food production but many products in which it has a comparative advantage, will be exported.
As incomes increase China will become increasingly significant as a market for Canadian food products if: they are of a type and quality desired by Chinese consumers & distributors and; can compete on price.
Statistics indicate that in 2004, the value of China’s imports of agricultural, agri-food & seafood products from Canada was more than double that of 2003.
In 2003 Canada was tenth after Malaysia, Australia, Thailand, Russia, Indonesia and New Zealand.

TABLE OF CONTENTS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY REGIONAL OVERVIEW IMPORTATION DISTRIBUTION:
A GLANCE DISTRIBUTION CHALLENGES RECEIVING PAYMENT TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE & LOGISTIC FOOD MERCHANDISING APPENDIX BIBLIOGRAPHY
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Canada's performance in China and the Yangzi Delta continues to improve annually.
Increasingly, Canadian companies are choosing to enter the China market with their product, or expand their existing services.
In 2002, Canadian exports to China were valued at approximately 2% of China's total imports, making Canada the 6th largest trading partner with China.
In 2002, the total Canadian food export to China reached $584 million, of which 11% entered through or to Shanghai.
The total fishery/seafood export to China in 2002 was $124 million, in which 15% entered through or to Shanghai.
In the first three months of 2003, Canadian exports to China reached $88.5 million.
For the Canadian exporter, distribution is one of the largest challenges.
China's sheer geographic size, complicated distribution industry and regional differences make national distribution a challenging and daunting task.
Establishing a comprehensive, thorough distribution system is critical for success in the Chinese market.
China is in a period of transition.
Its accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) has created significant new opportunities for Canadian exporters and has facilitated access to the Chinese market.
The Chinese import process has been streamlined and has become increasingly transparent.
Infrastructure projects are blossoming, a strong consumer culture is emerging and a penchant to try new, imported products is developing.
China's distribution system has evolved drastically over the last two decades.
With free market principles at work, the system has undergone the necessary changes to compete in the world market place.
Although state-owned companies control the majority of distribution, they are limited to distributing bulk and certain niche commodities.
Strong private sector distributors and wholesalers have emerged to meet the demands of foreign import products and exporters.
Employing a private distributor is the most common method used by Canadian exporters.
Though improvements are constant the transportation infrastructure is inadequate, the distribution industry fragmented, the legal system under-developed and the banking structure opaque.
These barriers can have a negative impact on the import process.
Canadian companies are strongly advised to perform due diligence before entering the market.
This report is designed to provide Canadian companies with a comprehensive overview of the distribution system in China and the challenges associated with distribution.
A dedicated Canadian company, with the right combination of product and strategy can penetrate and be successful in the market.
Nation-wide distribution is obtainable with the right strategy and a little creativity.

REGIONAL OVERVIEW East China, also known as the Yangzi Delta region is a major importer of Canadian agricultural commodities.
Canadian exports of grains, oilseeds and live seafood are among Canada's top ten exports to East China.
The city of Shanghai is one of the best potential markets in China for imported and value-added foods.
The Canadian Consulate's AgFood team places strong emphasis on promoting Canadian processed foods in this market.
The neighbouring provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provide excellent opportunities for agricultural technologies, including farming, animal genetics, food processing, and seafood/fishery processing and aquatics.
It should be noted that with the rapid development of logistics and infrastructure networks in the Yangzi Delta, second tier cities in the region, such as Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi and Hefei are increasingly viewed as potential markets for imported foods.
Shanghai The market for imported food products in Shanghai is developing rapidly.
In 1990, Shanghai opened its first supermarket.
Prior to that date, food shopping was primarily carried out in wet markets or government-owned dry goods stores.
Today, there are 3,300 modern retail outlets operating in the city, (each over 700 square metres in size), of which 2,000 were established in 2002 alone.
Four of the top ten supermarket companies in China are headquartered in Shanghai.
In the past, distribution was a main challenge for foreign importers.
The system was fraught with bad infrastructure and inadequate food storage facilities.
Of late, there have been significant improvements in this area.
The governments of Shanghai and the surrounding provinces have invested significantly in developing regional transportation infrastructure.
Accessing smaller villages or hamlets can still be difficult, but the infrastructure provides good coverage to major regional centres.
Improvements in retailing and warehousing capabilities are also noteworthy.
The 2002 per capita GDP in Shanghai reached US$4,900, and the 2003 GDP growth rate reached 11.8%, both at the top in China.
Of this percentage, close to 10% is spent on dining out.
Shanghai's drive to become an international city has heightened the city's growth.
Key events such as the Expo 2010 in Shanghai will accelerate the flow of investment and people into the city from both international and domestic sources.
As a result, Shanghai will continue to be an ideal market for high-quality processed or imported food products.
Shanghai's vibrant hospitality industry, modern distribution systems, established retail system and adventurous consumers are creating significant opportunities for Canadian exporters.
There are currently 28 local importers or distributors in Shanghai that regularly import processed food from Canada.
Canadian products are perceived as clean, natural, safe and of good quality.
Canadian seafood, especially live seafood and fishery products, are particularly welcomed.
According to AAFC statistics, the total amount of Chinese imports from Canada reached $307 million dollars.
Approximately 1/3 of Canadian exports entered China through the port of Shanghai.
Grains, barley and oil seeds account for the most significant share of Canada's total exports to China, while processed food exports are minimal.
However, the combination of China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and a growing interest in foreign foods is leading to increased demand for processed food products in the region.
Provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui These three provinces have strong agricultural capabilities.
Local governments have emphasised the development of local agricultural infrastructure and production technologies, and have accordingly allocated significant investment funds.
Urban dwellers in these three provinces are using their new purchasing power to demand increasingly high-quality food products, either from the Shanghai market, or imported directly from overseas countries.
Consequently consumer demand is spurring the local development of the food processing industries.
Several companies have already emerged in the local food and beverage processing sector, such as the Yurun Group in Nanjing (meat), the Wahaha Group in Hangzhou (beverages), and the Qiaqia Group in Hefei (native Chinese produces).
Canada has enjoyed significant success in the animal husbandry sector in the region, particularly in Zhejiang province, due to two CIDA-funded projects focused on breeding dairy cattle and lean swine farming.
Agricultural technologies, food processing, swine/dairy/beef genetics, animal feed and fish/aquatic also have great potential in these markets.
The USA is the largest exporter of processed foods and agricultural technologies to China.
Australia, the UK, New Zealand and several Southeast Asian countries are also active in the market.
PERCENTAGE OF SHANGHAI HOUSEHOLDS GROUPED BY DISPOSABLE INCOME Shanghai Statistical Yearbook Per Capita Annual Living Expenditure of Urban Households- Shanghai 2001 Shanghai Statistical Yearbook In 2002, Canadian exports accounted for approximately 1.3% of China's total imports.
Food exports (grains, barley, and oil seeds) account for the significant share of Canada's total exports whereas processed, valueadded food exports are minimal.
However with the combination of China's market reforms and the growing interest in imported food, they have risen in the last years.
Food purchases represent the largest expenditure of consumer spending.
Urban households currently spend 39% of their annual living expenditure on food purchases.
Of this per cent, close to 10% is spent on dining out.
Recreation and education represent the second biggest 13% expenditure with only 13%.
In 2002, the following food products were reported to have sold well in the Shanghai and the Yangzi Delta market and are expected to ontinue  to provide future opportunities for Canadian companies:
• Fish and seafood;
• Processed meat;
• Dairy products;
• Wine and beverages;
• Confectionery;
• Nutraceutical foods.
However, the Chinese market is not an easy market to enter.
The key to success is recognising that opportunities lie in specific regions and income groups.
Significant time and effort needs to be dedicated in researching and formulating a market entry strategy.
Making assumptions based on other markets may prove costly when applied in China.
A key success factor is to be attentive and to address local market needs.
Shanghai consumers are sensitive to issues of convenience, sanitation, flavour, nutrition and price.
Consumers are willing to pay a premium price for foods viewed as higher quality, nutritious and imported.
Shanghai's drive to become an international city has heightened the city's growth.
Key events, such as Expo 2010 in Shanghai and the 2008 Beijing Olympics, will accelerate the money and people flow into the city by both foreign, local and government sources.
As a result, Shanghai will continue to represent an ideal market for processed and imported food products.
For the right product and strategy, opportunities exist.
With careful planning, dedication and consideration, Canadian exporters can be successful in the market.
IMPORTATION China's recent accession to the WTO has created significant new opportunities for Canadian exporters and has facilitated access to the Chinese market.
Lower tariff rates, transparent reporting systems and international standards are creating an increasingly favourable trading environment.
The importation system and procedures have greatly improved over the last five years.
Nevertheless, there are still significant challenges and barriers.
The main hurdles are clearing quarantine, obtaining the correct paperwork and adjusting to the new system.
At present, the Chinese government is in the process of reforming their systems and implementing new ones.
The transition period has created confusion as companies' need to scramble to become compliant with new laws.
In addition, an increasing number of new non-tariff barriers are applied during the import process further complicating the procedure.
Quarantine For foreign food exporters, the largest challenge and hurdle begins with the quarantine and health inspection.
The General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) in Beijing, is the national bureau responsible for the inspection and quarantine of any export or import of animal, plant and foodstuff products.
They are also responsible for creating technical standards, policies and regulations.
Regional offices are established throughout the country to assist with implementation, but have no influence on creating or approving regulations.
The Shanghai Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine (SHCIQ) normally inspects all agriculture or agri-food products once they arrive at the Port of Shanghai.
Exemptions and sampling rates are determined based on the history of the importer or exporter, the products involved and the volume.
Challenges associated with the AQSIQ include import licenses, labelling regulations, lack of transparent regulations, non-scientific quarantine, bureaucracy and inflexibility of the bureau.
Exporters largest complaint is that the detention of products is done on an unscientific basis, using regulations against the WTO and that few Chinese producers can meet.
The largest example is genetically modified food products and pathogen-free meats.
In most cases, there are no written documents stating the requirements.
For dairy and meat products additional regulations apply.
China has official protocols with Canada for export of beef and pork products from Canada.
AQSIQ requires a Chinese inspector visit and assess the foreign meat processing plant.
Once approved, the plant is granted permission to export their product to China.
Currently, there are 40 Canadian meat plants approved to export their product.
This process is managed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), who in turn works with AQSIQ to arrange their inspection and approval.
Chinese Customs Chinese Customs is an implementation organisation.
It simply enforces the laws and regulations created from various Chinese government departments.
Customs is responsible for assessing tariffs, quotas and verifying appropriate licenses.
Exporters and foreign business in Shanghai quote the largest improvement has occurred within Chinese customs.
The import-export process has been streamlined and general transparency increased.
Customs have written documents and have held workshops outlining the customs procedure.
With proper documentation, clearing products is relatively easy.
Whereas clearing a good once took weeks, today, the average time is 3 days.
Classing systems and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) are allowing certain companies to further fast track their goods.
Challenges associated with Chinese Customs are inflexible working hours, bureaucratic nature, non-tariff barriers, HS classification, national favouritism and custom duties.
Clearing the Product Once the shipment arrives at the point of entry, the imported products undergo the following before being released from AQSIQ and Customs: 1.
Inspection and Quarantine by the AQSIQ – The process is normally done at the port of entry or at the importer's bonded warehouse.
They test for pesticides, antibiotics, visible and non-visible problems.
AQSIQ will also ensure the label is correct.
If approved, AQSIQ issues a Pass certificate.
The product is inspected by Chinese Customs 5.
Chinese customs verifies the packing list, commercial invoices and shipping documents.
They classify the good and determine the amount of duty to pay.
They are also responsible for checking the quality, weight and quantity.
Once all the correct documentation and payment is received, customs will release the product to the importer.
Other Players There are various government departments involved in importing goods to China.
The Minister of Agriculture (MOA) is responsible for the development and safety of the Chinese agriculture sector.
They are central in formulating regulations governing genetically modified organisms (GMO).
China's rules require safety certificates stating GMO products are not harmful to humans, animals or the environment.
Exporting companies must now provide scientific experiments demonstrating the product is safe for consumption.
Once the product is determined safe, the Minister of Agriculture will issue a safety certificate.
It is the responsibility of the exporting company to declare the use of GMO in their products.
The AQSIQ has the right to search and examine the product.
If they determine genetically modified products, the product will not enter China and will be handled accordingly.
The original GMO regulation was issued in January 2002.
Under a United States brokered deal, the Chinese government agreed to issue "interim certificates" while exporters performed the necessary tests and the Chinese finalised the details.
Since then interim certificate have been extended from the initial December 2002 deadline, to September 2003 and recently to April 2004.
North American farmers are particularly negatively affected by the GMO regulation.
The majority of the American soybean crop and the Canadian 'rapeseed' crops are genetically modified.
The opponents claim China's regulation has no scientific basis, going against WTO regulations on Agriculture.
The Chinese government is stalling to provide time for Chinese farmers to cultivate their own industry.
Extensive lobbying on the American and Chinese government continues to occur in efforts to change the current regulations.
Soybeans are particularly sensitive as no quota system dictates their flow.
Tariff Rate Quotas apply to bulk such as wheat and canola.
The Minister of Health determines and approves functional food products.
Functional foods are defined as any products possessing health care functions, but are limited in the purpose of curing diseases.
Importers are required to apply to the Minister of Health for a 'functional foods certificate' and approval number endorsing the safety of the product.
The application procedure involves functional tests, scientific evidence supporting the product and complete lists of ingredients.
The certificate must accompany the product during the import process, and the approval number must be printed on all packaging.
Licensed Importers Under China's current trade regulations, Chinese companies must obtain an import license before entering goods into the country.
Import licenses are issued by the "Industrial and Commercial Administration Board" of the newly founded "Ministry of Commerce".
The Ministry of Commerce is a joint government department combining the old bureau responsible for external trade, the "Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation" (MOFTEC) and the bureau responsible for internal trade, the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC).
Currently, full import licenses are only available to large state-owned and domestic private companies.
Private Chinese companies must meet certain criteria (import levels, annual revenue, and number of employees) before qualifying for an import license.
Full import licenses allow companies to sell directly to the public; act as an agent for a smaller Chinese or foreign distributors who do not possess a license; import goods for internal manufacturing and import materials for manufacturing.
Also, these companies have access to foreign capital.
Foreign distributors, joint venture companies (JV) and wholly owned foreign enterprises (WOFE) can only import goods for internal manufacturing and materials for the manufacturing process.
They cannot function as a trader to re-sell the imported products directly to another buyer or the end-user.
As a result JVs, WOFEs and smaller Chinese companies commission an import agent (company with a full license) to import goods on their behalf.
Once cleared, they are free to distribute the product and sell directly to end consumer.
The import agent will also organise payment for the goods to the foreign party.
Restrictions on import licenses are scheduled to be removed.
In 2004, JVs are permitted to obtain import licenses, followed by WOFEs in 2005.
The import licence system will be abolished completely in 2006.
Import Tariffs and Value Added Tax China's accession to the WTO has resulted in a significant reduction of tariffs on key agriculture and agrifood commodities.
On average tariffs for all goods range from 15.3% to 12%, a 21.6% decrease from their original levels.
In 2003, agricultural tariffs will be cut from 18.1% to 16.8%.
Tariff reductions will occur over the period of the next three years.
In addition, a value-added tax (VAT) is applied to all products entering into the market from abroad.
Though improved, the VAT plus the tariff can significantly increase the cost of the import.
The following chart demonstrates the tariff rate and the VAT on key import products.
The VAT is 13% on unprocessed, unpackaged food and 17% on processed, packaged food.
17% Fruit & Vegetable Mixture of Fruit Juices 29% 26% 23% 29%
13% Tomatoes, fresh or chilled 13% 0%

Food Labelling Effective November 1 2002, all imported and exported food products must adhere to the Chinese labelling regulations.
All food labels must be inspected, verified and issued a 'Certificate of Import Export Food Labelling' by the AQSIQ.
AQSIQ specified laboratories will test the food nutrition and quality to ensure that the label is accurate.
An approval certificate is required prior to applying for goods-arrival inspection and other customs formalities.
Shanghai applications can be submitted to the SHCIQ.
They will perform the initial testing, and submit it to the AQSIQ for final approval.
If all the correct documentation is provided, approval of the label should be issued within 50 working days.
One application can be submitted for the same product (ingredient, package) and the only difference is the weight.
The importer can import the goods only once the AQSIQ approval certificate is received.
All packaged food products (international or local products) must be affixed with a Chinese language label indicating the following:
• Name of the food
• Ingredient Table
• Net contents on the packaged (volume or weight)
• Name and Address of the importer and manufacturer
• Production and Expiry date
• Storage directions
• Country of Origin
Labelling refers to all written language, graphs, symbols, layout and explanation materials of packaged food products.
All Chinese language must be in simplified Chinese characters.
Please see the Appendix B for a copy of the registration form.
Label stickers can be used providing they have received the AQSIQ approval.
The stickers cannot be detached from the product.
The size of the English characters cannot exceed that of the Chinese.
Import Route The most common method to import products to the Chinese market is to work with a local distributor or wholesaler.
The Chinese party will arrange all custom formalities, import licenses, paperwork and distribution of your product.
Canadian companies avoid the hassles of customs, logistics and distribution.
As identified above, the distributor does not need to actually possess a licence to import the product, as they employ government certified company (private or stateowned) to import goods on their behalf.
Additional distribution methods and challenges will be discussed in the proceeding section.
In the past, many goods entered China by using a series of grey channels.
Though this has declined significantly, it is still common for certain goods as ginseng or fruit products.
Grey channel products are subject to less duty, avoid quarantine and the time delay involved with the official route.
The Chinese government has taken significant steps in the past years to halt smuggling and curtail grey channels.
Companies are strongly advised not to use such illegal routes to enter China.
Points to Remember:
• The import process has become increasingly streamlined and transparent.
With the proper paper work a hassle-free, fast clearance is possible.
• Certain products such as GMOs, grain, oilseeds, nutraceuticals and meat products require special licenses before entering the Chinese market.
• Ensure the correct; certified labelling is placed on all products.
• The largest hurdle begins with the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ).
Their processes continue to be non-transparent and inflexible.
• Under WTO accession, import tariffs are scheduled to be reduced.
The value added tax (VAT) and import tariff attribute to the total cost of export process.
• Canadian exporters work with a local distributor or wholesaler.
The Chinese party arranges custom formalities, import licenses, paperwork and distribution of your product.
• Avoid all grey and illegal routes into China.
DISTRIBUTION:
A GLANCE Today, the distribution system has evolved drastically.
Eastern coastal cities, as Shanghai, have developed the necessary infrastructure to meet the market's need.
Much needed infrastructure projects, industry reorganisation and elimination of restrictions on foreign participation will further improvement.
Nevertheless, distribution remains the largest challenge for foreign companies striving to achieve market success.
It is also the most crucial.
China's vast geographical size requires the movement of goods over long distances- a daunting task given China's inadequate transportation infrastructure, lack of warehousing facilities and different regional characteristics.
Despite improvements, the distribution system remains chaotic and inefficient.
China's accession to the WTO is expected to improve the current situation.
The distribution industry will become increasingly open to foreign companies.
By 2006, foreign companies will be granted full trading and import rights.
Industry analysts believe this will be a positive step for the distribution industry.
Foreign operators will introduce new competition, infrastructure, and management expertise.
The Chinese government will reserve the right to exclusively manage the trade of certain products (bulk commodities, tobaccos) and to maintain restrictions on certain sectors of the transportation industry (air).
The traditional Chinese state-controlled distribution system has been almost abolished.
The remnants of the old system remain in place, but are in the midst of revamping their organisations to compete in the market economy.
Each of these distribution systems offers a unique set of advantages and disadvantages.
In general, private domestic distributors are the most feasible and accessible channels for Canadian companies to work with when entering the market for the first time.
Depending on the company's future plans, current resources, and product line, the other methods remain viable options.
Traditional to Modern Distribution Systems Traditionally, the Chinese distribution system was opaque, hard to navigate and difficult to maintain control of the product.
All goods were mandated to enter the country through a stateowned Foreign Trade Corporations (FTCs).
The FTC would subsequently fan them out to provincial, city or regional state-owned distributors or wholesalers.
FTCs were not permitted to sell products directly to the end user.
As no market forces were at work, distributors provided basic services as transportation and some warehousing.
Customer service, marketing or sales reporting were non existent.
The traditional distribution system was divided into three rigid hierarchical levels.
The first tier concentrated on major cities as Shanghai, Beijing, and Guanzhou.
These cities allocated and transported the products to the second tier, provincial wholesalers.
Second tier wholesalers were located in the provincial capital or other medium-size cities in the province.
These wholesalers delivered the goods to the third tier, local wholesalers.
Also, large state owned department stores were also considered third tier and were responsible to distribute to the smaller retail stores.
Provincial factories were responsible for the smaller cities', township's and village's factories.
Every level of the hierarchy was responsible for meeting a production quota imposed by the State Planning Commission.
The Ministry of Trade (since been replaced by the Ministry of Commerce) managed and oversaw the distribution of the products to retail outlets and determined the price for all goods in the market.
The following graph represents the traditional distribution structure.
The year 1986 marked the breakdown of the traditional state-owned distribution system.
The majority of the state-owned distributors became private distributors and/or wholesalers.
Additionally, numerous small, private distributors have opened their doors over the years.
Confident in the first-mover concept, foreign multinationals have rushed to the market in preparation of future liberalisation.
Foreign companies now operate in the distribution, logistics, warehousing, sales and marketing sectors.
Today, only products such as grain or coal continue to be distributed through the traditional system.
The following graph represents the modern distribution system.
Designated large department stores, hotels and large supermarkets are the only actors who can import directly from overseas manufacturers or suppliers.
Significant layers and regulations have been removed.
Exporters are now able to exert more control on the product, and penetrate deeper into the market.
Distribution Channels Companies selling in China, whether importing or distributing locally made goods, must rely on a combination of distribution channels to reach retailers and consumers, especially if they attempt nation-wide coverage.
In general, markets are highly regional and different characteristics and regulations apply in each.
The key to approaching the China market is to treat it as a series of different markets, and not just one.
Despite the drawbacks and challenges, foreign operators have been successful at creating interim solutions to their distribution woes.
Albeit, they are not the most cost efficient and practical, foreign operators are increasingly able to reach their target destinations with minimal hassle and within their time frame.
As identified above, the most common distribution methods to import and to distribute products in China are:
• State Owned Distributors
• Foreign Based Distributors
• Establishing a local presence One practice may not be enough to achieve deep penetration or nation-wide coverage.
Often, a combination of different strategies is needed to be successful.
State Owned Distributors State Owned Distributors are commonly used for large bulk commodities (barley and canola) and niche products (wine and spirits) requiring specialised import licenses.
They seldom import small quantities of goods.
It is estimated that 70% of food imports, including bulk commodities, enter the country through a state owned distributors.
Often, state-owned distributors own their own transportation and logistics companies.
The Shanghai Food Import Export Corporation General, Shanghai Fisheries General Corporation Group (monopoly on frozen products), Shanghai Wine, Spirits and Sugar (monopoly on alcohol) and the Shanghai Food Group are the largest operators in Shanghai.
Traditionally, state owned distributors were notorious for their inefficiencies and lax service standards.
Today, due to increased market competition and entry of global players, they have reorganised their operations and have significantly improved the services they offer.
Advantages
• Access to an established distribution and transportation network
• Possession of needed import licenses
• Strong purchasing power and access to foreign capital
• Connection to government parties Disadvantages
• Specializes in large import orders
• High commissions
• Difficult to maintain control over the product Private Domestic Companies Private domestic distributors or wholesalers are the most chosen mode of distribution for valueadded food products.
Distributors represent a series of related, but non-competitive products.
They provide customs clearance, basic distribution, warehousing and sales for the product.
As stated earlier, working with a domestic distributor is the most common method for Canadian exporters to enter the market.
The Canadian Consulate in Shanghai can assist in locating a reputable and experienced distributor.
Please see the Appendix on Canadian Food Distributors in the Yangzi Delta for a list of distributors carrying Canadian food products in Shanghai.
Other sources include the local chamber of commerce, word of mouth, trade organisations and other Canadian government departments.
Another key, effective method is to attend trade shows related to your product field.
Distributors circulate among booths looking for potential product ranges.
Shanghai is home to numerous trade shows throughout the year catering to a wide variety of products.
The largest all-purpose food shows are Food and Hotel China (FHC) and SIAL.
• Competitive Prices
• Knowledge and acceptance of local
• Geographic scope
• Close to the end user and can provide quick turn-around time.
• Danger of disloyalty (commission based, leave for higher paying market product)
• May not be familiar ith your product or its standards.
• Poor handling and distribution.
Tips for dealing with your distributor
• It is important to provide Chinese language information to your local distributor.
This will assist the company in selling the product to both the retail outfit and the end-consumer.
• One of the largest complaints of local distributors concerning foreign importers is their commitment to the market.
Domestic companies are interested in representing companies who have long term commitment in the market.
• Exporters should provide marketing financing and promotional materials.
Do not assume the distributor will automatically privide this service.
• Working closely with the distributor will help create relationships, demonstrate commitment, ensure the product is marketed, experience in the market and achieve higher sales.
• Establish local staff presence to work and assist distributors.
Foreign Based Distributor and Wholesalers Foreign-based distributors offer a fuller and more modern range of distribution services with wider coverage, on a multi-regional, or near national basis.
They have established arrangements with local governments and local companies to solidify their foundation.
In most cases, they are multi-national companies operating in more than one world market and their product range and representative services are not limited to food products.
They offer a wide range of services from advertising, distribution, transportation and logistics.
The better known companies operating in the China market include SIMS Trading, Jebsen & Co.
Ltd., Inchcape PLC, EAC and JDH (Li & Fung).
The key drawbacks to using a foreign-based distributor are the added costs to the company, lack of local connections and propensity to carry large, niche products.
Higher costs are associated with the use of a foreign presence and the additional services they provide.
The cost is in turn reflected in the price of the good.
Generally, foreign distributors carry international brands recognisable around the world.
Profile of Selected Foreign Distributors in China:
Sales and Distribution Logistics SIMS Trading
• 30 city branches
• Employs more than 320 staff
• Distribution network of 60 cities
• Serving 10 Principles (Kraft)
• Concentrates on consumer goods, including food, beverage and healthcare
• Strong in Hong Kong, Macao and South China
• Multiple JV with local wholesalers
• Establihed JV with Guangdong based logistics company
• JV with Nestle Jebson & Co.
• Long established with more than 100 years experience in Hong Kong and China
• Serving 100+ principals, not limited to food products (San Pellegrino water, Blue Girl Beer)
• Broad range of products from cars and accessories; chemicals and industrial equipment
• Head office in Hong Kong
• Warehousing
These include establishing a representative office (RO), Joint venture (JV) or Wholly Owned Foreign Enterprise (WOFE).
Depending on the license, a local presence allows the foreign company better control over the marketing, pricing, distribution and sales of the product.
Direct contact with retailers and market players enhances business relationship furthering potential success.
Each license entails a different application process, business scope and set-up fees.
A representative office is the cheapest method to establish market presence.
Applicant companies must be a minimum of a year old and possess a certain level of registered capital (depending on the region).
Applications are approved in 30 days, and the application cost is approximately $CND 4050.
A RO license allows the company to rent office space, hire employees, market the product, perform market research, provide support service and establish relationships.
A RO can not issue invoices and receive payment for goods or services provided in China; can not manufacturer any goods and can not hire staff directly.
Taxes are based on expenses incurred.
To circumvent the trading restriction, a RO issues invoices from their parent company or a Hong Kong shell company.
In addition, a RO can not receive an import license, and must continue to rely on a local importer and distributors to import the product on their behalf.
Closing a RO is difficult, as it requires permission from the Chinese bureau.
  Joint Venture establishments are another option to establish a presence.
A JV is used when the Chinese party can provide beneficial assets (technology, licenses, land, infrastructure) or the industry is closed to complete foreign participation (restaurants, bars, logistics, education).
There are two forms of JV- equity and co-operative.
In an equity partnership, the foreign companies pays the Chinese partner a pre-determined lump sum in a set time frame.
Often, the Chinese partner is silent and retains no management control in the company.
This arrangement is common for the restaurant and bar industry.
Equity joint ventures are based on shareholder and company profits.
Their main drawbacks are lack of full management control, and sharing of profits.
Companies entering a JV arrangement are advised to perform due diligence on their Chinese partner before undertaking any venture.
Increasingly, foreign companies are choosing to open a WOFE.
The licensing arena (consulting, trading and manufacturing) has opened significantly creating a host of new options.
A WOFE allows foreign companies access to China's cheap labour force, better access to the local market and local production rights.
Famous brands as Pepsi, Coke, Frito Lays, Wrigley's Gum, Dove Chocolate bars, Kit Kat are all produced locally.
Manufacturing locally allows for easier distribution, lowered prices and greater market awareness.
WOFEs have complete control over management, distribution, sales, hiring practices and invoicing.
Taxes are based on profit.
WOFE have the ability to convert local currency to foreign dollars for remittance offshore.
The key impediment to this option is the required capital involved to obtain a licence and to operate in the Chinese market.
In Shanghai, the required registered capital is $188,000.00 to 268,000.00.
Registered capital can be used as working capital.
The additional costs of running the operations are applied above this amount.
• Maximum level of control over the product
• Establish relationships with local contacts
• Establish long term presence and brand name of the product
• Legal entity status Disadvantages
• Higer costs associated with establishing an office (rent, salaries, processing)
• Required commitment to the market It is recommended that interested parties consult professional advice before reaching a final decision and commencing application procedures.
In Shanghai, there are numerous well qualified, knowledgeable consulting companies and lawyers specialising in the above.
A list of consultants can be obtained by contacting the Canadian Consulate General in Shanghai.
Appointing various distributors in each region of the country is another.
At relatively low costs, this option involves paying a limited number of distributors to sell and distribute the product.
Distributors could effectively handle transportation and logistical co-ordination.
The key is to develop a manageable network that is reliable and trustworthy.
In general, distributors are strategically chosen in the south east, central east, and north central areas of China.
Often, beverage (including spirits and beer) companies.
Key Regions Key Cities and Provinces Population GDP per Capita (average per region) North Central Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei 90.9 million $CND 2918 Cental East Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Shanghai 323.9 million $CND 2319 Central Hubei, Hunan, Henan 221.3 million $CND 1069 North East Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning 107 million $CND 1568 North West Shanxi, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, Neimeng, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia 124 million $CND 908 South East Guangdong, Fujian, Hainan 120 million $CND 1794 South West Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Chongqing 246 million $CND 756
EVALUATING A POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTOR Does the distributor have a strong, financial background?
To ensure payment and proper distribution, extensive due diligence is required to determine the financial status of the distributor.
Providing they are not competitors, suppliers or other clients are often willing to supply information.
Third party credit checking companies offer credit checks.
Does the distributor have a good knowledge of the local business market, regulations and import procedures?
A distributor who is intimately aware of the import procedures and Chinese regulations will ensure a smooth transition of the good to the market.
The history of the company, their experience, their business activities and a list of their clients (international and domestic) are good indicators of their performance.
Does the distributor have adequate and maintained facilities (warehouse, transportation)?
Is the distributor physically strong (man power, infrastructure, expertise)?
In general, Chinese distributors lack adequate storage and transportation systems.
Products with special requirement, as cold storage, may find it more difficult to find a distributor.
Distributors will advertise modern facilities, but as due diligence, it is important to either visit the facilities or exactly determine the nature of these.
Does the distributor have an established distribution network?
Depending on the need of your products, it is important to choose a distributor who can provide regional coverage.
A well-connected and established distributor in one area may have insufficient capacity in a neighbouring area.
Do they offer additional services (marketing support, sales report)?
Do not assume all distributors offer a full set of services.
Additional services as marketing support and sales reports are not common.
Some distributors are willing to assist with marketing the product providing they receive adequate financing and promotional materials.
What is their current product portfolio?
Are there similar products to yours?
Similar product lines can determine the experience of the distributor in selling your product.
It will also eliminate any conflicting interests with other products that are too similar.
Does the distributor have all the necessary licenses to operate legally in China?
Review the distributors licenses to ensure they are able to offer the services they advertise and meet you company's needs.
Points to Remember:
• Distribution remains the largest challenge for imported products in China.
• China accession to the WTO and improvements in domestic infrastructure, are expected to act as a catalyst for future development.
• State-owned distributors, private domestic companies and foreign-based distributors are the main mechanisms to distribute goods in China.
• A combination of methods may be necessary to distribute the product nationally.
• A clear examination of the exporter's need and long-term vision is advised prior to selecting the right distribution strategy.
DISTRIBUTION CHALLENGES The single greatest challenge of nation-wide distribution is the development and management of an effective distribution system.
Achieving a broad and deep penetration of agri-food products in key population centres is a challenge.
Difficulties stem from a variety of problems:
• Legal constraints and regulations
• Accounts receivable
• Fragmented distribution system (wholesaler, distributor, retailers)
• Intellectual Property Rights
• Out-dated or ill-equipped transportation system
• High cost to enter the market (establishing a presence, price of imported foods)
• Establishing Relationships
Legal Constraints and Regulations Since 1979, China has made significant advances in legal reform.
The increased economic activity, foreign investments and foreign companies operating in the market will continue to act as a catalyst to further legal reform.
Under WTO, China has committed itself to the development of an independent, transparent, and impartial legal system.
Although, China has opened its doors significantly to the outside world significant legal restrictions remain in place.
For example, foreign companies establishing a local presence must obtain the correct licensing requirements.
Licenses narrowly define the activities (hiring practices, business activities and required capital) a company can perform in the market.
Certain industries still require a joint-venture partner to open and operate (restaurants).
In addition, the use of import licenses is considered a non-tariff barrier.
Protectionism remains a problem for international companies accessing the market.
Local governments tend to support the domestic industry to the foreign one.
Protectionist practices occur on a national and provincial level.
Practices include support packages, reduced property rental, reduced taxes and government assistance.
In addition, laws and regulations are interpreted and applied differently from region to region.
Export subsidies and quota requirements are still employed to develop the domestic industry.
Another key concern for foreign companies operating in the market is dispute resolution.
Under WTO requirements, China is required to establish a dispute resolution system.
Though improvements have been made international lawyers and foreign companies prefer to settle disputes through business practices or international arbitration centres.
Reasons cited are time and cost of the judicial process; lack of judicial independence; professional capacity of the judicial system; high levels of corruption; and lack of real enforcement mechanisms.
Accounts Receivable A key legitimate concern for any business is receiving payment for their goods or services.
Unfortunately, simply making a sale and signing a contract does not ensure this will occur.
Distributors can be slow in rendering payment for the goods or simply defaulting for various reasons.
The problem occurs for both foreign and domestic enterprises.
All to often, credit is extended on the strength of relationships and transactions are performed on a cash-only basis.
Exporters who extend credit to their wholesalers or distributors do so at their own risk and our advised to perform their own due diligence.
The problem is compounded by a weak credit system.
Though in the planning stage, there is no national credit information bureau.
Trial run services have begun in Shanghai and Beijing.
Performing credit assessments can be a daunting task.
With no central information base, financial history and dept repayment is difficult to ascertain.
Various third party service providers, as Duns & Bradstreet, offer credit assessments.
The Chinese government recognises the need to develop a sound credit system in order to ensure financial stability, further economic development and to compete internationally.
The system is further effected by an under-developed judicial system, lack of real enforcement mechanism in which to collect defaulted payments, a developing banking system and tightly controlled foreign currency.
Please see the section entitled 'Receiving Payment' for additional details on receiving payment in China.
Fragmented Industry The entire distribution process is highly fragmented with many layers of people and organisations between the importer and the end consumer.
Each layer ultimately adds to the price of the item.
The whole process can be time consuming, frustrating and difficult to manage.
The problem applies equally to Chinese based companies.
Fragmentation occurs within distribution, wholesaling, warehousing, suppliers, transportation and logistics.
Retail stores are forced to deal with many different wholesalers or distributors to stock their shelves.
Most companies carry a limited product range.
The main reason is they lack the necessary capabilities, licenses, finances or warehouse space.
In addition, companies may lack the management skill and manpower to carry a varied line of products.
Adequate warehouse space continues to be a problem.
Distributors or wholesalers often own small quantities or rent from a third party.
Refrigerated capabilities or special requirements are difficult to find.
In such, opportunities exist for companies offering specialized services.
Intellectual Property Rights A key element of China's WTO membership is adherence to TRIPS (Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights).
China is also a member to the Berne Convention for the protection of literary and artistic works and the Paris convention on patents and trademarks.
Membership to these international organisations has not yet corrected the problem.
Though the government is trying to stem the problem, it lacks the enforcement capabilities and the system to be effective.
China continues to be a haven for counterfeit goods.
It is estimated that 20% of the consumer goods on the market are fake.
Food products are no exception.
A recent survey by the China National Administration for Industry and Commerce estimated 70% sold in restaurants and hotels are fake.
The problem is significantly better in Beijing and Shanghai.
As counterfeit products are generally of lesser quality, their appearance on the market can seriously undermine the real brand and the company.
While exporters have little control over the reproduction, steps can be taken to ensure better protection.
Foreign companies are encouraged to register their trademark with the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC) trademark office.
SAIC is responsible for registration and enforcement of trademark laws in China.
Trademarks are granted on first come, first serve basis.
Patents are registered at a separate office.
The State Intellectual Property Office issues and enforces patent laws.
While registration does not ensure counterfeiting will not occur, it provides the legal backing should it take place.
Exporters are advised to contact an intellectual property lawyer for further information on the process and the fees involved.
Points to Remember
• Protectionist practices continue to be an issue at both the national and local level of government.
• Disputes are normally settled through International Arbitration Centres, as the Chinese judicial system is still in a process of development and transformation.
• Determining the distributors or wholesalers ability to pay is difficult, as no national credit information bureau or real enforcement mechanism exists.
• The distribution system is fragmented with many different actors between the product source and end user.
• Copyright and trademark violation continues to be an issue in the Chinese market place.
Though no absolute protection is guaranteed, steps can be taken to ensure counter-action.
RECEIVING PAYMENT Receiving payment from your Chinese buyers should be given special attention.
Export risks can be minimised depending on the method of payment.
Payment terms should be well negotiated, understood and mutually accepted between the Canadian exporter and the Chinese company before any trade transactions occurs.
As the Chinese government maintains tight control over foreign currency exchange and the Remnibi is a closed currency, it is important to ensure that the Chinese importer can access foreign currency.
Using an established, reputable distributor or buyer should mitigate this problem.
The possible methods of payment include (in order of risk) payment upon receipt, consignment, letter of credit and payment in advance.
• Payment upon receipt should only be pursued if a long-term relationship has been established with the Chinese buyer and extensive due diligence has been performed to establish credibility.
Money is commonly transferred using a telegraphic transfer (TT).
• Payment on consignment is received only when the goods have been sold in the market.
If the Chinese buyer is inexperienced with import goods or is not convinced the product will sell well, consignment may be their preferred payment option.
Alternative payment arrangements may ensue depending on the success of the product.
• The most common and encouraged method of payment is a letter of credit (L/C).
A L/C is a letter from the Chinese importer's bank confirming and guaranteeing the payment once the goods and proper documentation (Bill of Lading) are received.
A L/C can be issued based on receipt, or on a term basis.
Exporters are protected as they are guaranteed payment for their goods.
The Bank of China has an established L/C program, a good reputation and is recognised for their neutrality.
Other issuing banks include the People's Construction Bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank of Communications and foreign banks with branch offices (HSBC, Citibank, Standard Chartered) in China.
It is important to note that obtaining a confirmed letter of credit is impossible, as China does not allow letters of credit issued by its banks to be confirmed by others, Chinese or foreign.
• Payment in advance is the less risky financing option for the Canadian exporter.
Exporters are assured payment and have the added working capital prior to the good's delivery.
Depending on the contract, a down payment is often negotiated as a guarantee of later payment.
Advance payments are common for seafood, or high value goods.
In general, Chinese buyers are not willing to pay in advance for goods.
TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE & LOGISTICS Freight Transportation in China Depending on the nature of the product and the company, transportation is a key element in achieving success for your product and should not be overlooked.
Great strides have been made to improve transportation infrastructure in Shanghai and other eastern coastal cities.
Good roads, frequent trains and waterways also connect the major cities in the neighbouring provinces.
Though improvements have been made in transportation and logistics, retail demand and China's own export market have grown at a faster pace.
Distributing westward, nationally or away from regional hubs continues to cause significant challenges.
The infrastructure system is archaic, undeveloped, and over-burdened with users.
Co-ordination between different modes of transportation and provincial interpretation of regulations are also problems.
At the moment, there are four different government bodies regulating air, water, rail and road.
Provincial protectionism impedes the development of the system and adds to transportation costs.
The American Chamber of Commerce predicts that logistic costs are often more than 16% of the product cost compared to 4% in most developed countries.
Another estimate by Morgan Stanley places the damage rate at 2% or higher for goods.
Damage is caused by excessive handling and inadequate infrastructure.
Added costs include highway tolls, corruption, vehicle repairs, protectionist practices and unpredictable delays.
Creativity is required when incorporating transportation into a distribution system.
While there is no blanket approach, some companies have strategically established regional distribution centres to effectively warehouse and distribute their products.
While others out-source the entire transport process to a third party logistics company.
Others, string together various local licenses and modes of transport to reach the end destination.
Companies need to choose the system, which works best for their product and their future strategies.
Infrastructure will continue to improve.
The development of an efficient transportation and logistic industry is necessary to sustain China's own economic growth rate.
Recognising this need, the Chinese government has committed financial resources to develop the nation's infrastructure.
The Shanghai government plans to transform the city into an international transportation hub.
Extensive development plans for the ports, air, rail and road systems have already begun.
Third Party Logistic Companies Given the complex nature of transportation and distribution in China, companies may wish to employ a freight-forwarder or third party logistic company to assist with the process.
Recent years have seen the Chinese market flooded with a variety of small, multi-national or domestic providers.
Under current Chinese regulations, with the exception of three, third party logistic companies require a joint-venture partner to operate nationally in China.
Wholly owned foreign providers can only operate within designated free trade zones.
Under China's WTO accession, this restriction is scheduled to be eliminated by 2006.
The three exceptions include Maersk, APL and P&O Nedlloyd.
As with choosing a distributor, third party logistics companies should be chosen carefully.
Onsite visits, client testimonials, word-of-mouth, client portfolio and infrastructure can assist in discerning the capabilities of the company.
Researching different avenues and providers should be performed before making a final decision.
The right match will make the difference in the market.
Although the competition is substantial, there remains significant opportunity for the right logistics company.
There are currently over 70 000 companies registered as logistic providers in the market.
The majority of these companies offer no more than basic transportation and warehousing facilities.
Their basic understanding of customer service levels and exporter's needs are limited.
Third Party logistics companies should gear up to offer turn-key solutions with a full range of service possibilities.
Companies that offer unique, customized services to small to medium size enterprises should fill in a niche sector of this complex and growing industry.
Air Air transport is the quickest and safest mode of transportation.
It is also the most expensive.
Often breakable, high-value, small electronic or rush items are transported by air.
Significant investment has been injected into the air cargo and passenger industry.
Over the last five years, the government has newly constructed or renovated over 40 of the national airports across the country.
The majority of the airports situated in the Yangzi Delta have been newly built, or renovated airport to handle air cargo.
In 2001, the Shanghai government opened the first-phase of the Pudong International Airport.
The second phase in scheduled to begin in 2003 and will further expand the airports handling capacity.
The major global airlines now have regular routes from Shanghai to their respective international destination.
DHL, UPS, ANA and FedEx have facilities at the new airport.
In addition, many of China's domestic airlines have re-vamped their services and offer enhanced passenger and cargo services.
The new Pudong airport is a much-needed supplement to the existing Hong Qiao airport.
Together the two airports handled 7,082,198 metric tons of cargo in 2002, with Hong Qiao receiving 732,532 and Pudong receiving 634,966.
Cargo handled at Pudong increased 80% from 2001, while that of Hong Qiao decreased 2.7%.
It is important to note Pudong airport only became operational in 2001.
As the industry develops, the Shanghai government plans to continue transferring more and more services from the old airport to the new one.
At the time of publication, the Hong Qiao Airport handles the majority of the domestic routes in China.
Water Shanghai, located at the mouth of the Yangzi River, is renowned for possessing one of the busiest and most modern ports in China.
In 2002, the Shanghai port attracted the highest dollar amount of imports entering China, with Nanjing, Jiangsu province in fourth place.
In recent years, shipping facilities, operations and customer services have been streamlined allowing for greater efficiency.
According to Shanghai port officials, the port handled a record 220 million tons of cargo in 2001, a 10% increase from the prior year.
The major international carriers (COSCO, OOCL, MAERSK, and APL) have regular, fixed schedules to Shanghai.
The Shanghai Port Authority is constructing a deep-water port in order to enhance its port handling capabilities and compete with other Asian ports as Singapore or Hong Kong.
At the moment, the Shanghai port is limited in the size of container ship it can accept, as the mouth of the Yangzi delta is only 8.5 metres deep.
In 2001, the port was capable of handling 5.61 million 20-foot containers.
In 2010, it will handle 20 million containers.
Other renovations and expansion plans are being carried out to other ports through out the country and the region.
Currently, there are over 170 ports in operation in China.
Whereas China's off shore and ocean going shipping has expanded rapidly, inland water transportation has slowed in growth.
Inland water transportation lacks the technology and finances to develop.
They do not possess the capabilities to handle large container ships.
Roadways Trucking is the most used form of transportation.
It is also the most cost-effective and efficient.
Eastern coastal cities, as Shanghai and its neighbouring regional centres, are well connected by a series of roads and highways.
Outside these areas, the road system requires significant upgrading.
Recognising the need for improvement, the State Development Plan announced an additional 200,000 kms of new roads, of which half will be expressways.
Currently in China, there are 1,698,000 kms of highways, of which only 19,400 km are expressways.
The main drawback of the trucking industry is its high degree of decentralisation.
The average Chinese trucking firm owns one truck.
There is no one national trucking company.
The decentralised state makes tracking, logistics and reliability a challenge.
In addition, corruption and local protectionism continues to hamper the development of a nation-wide industry.
Out of province truck drivers are often forced to pay high toll fees and obtain regional licenses.
Local cities have their own distribution system, and often accord their companies sole rights for distribution.
Within the city of Shanghai, main roads are congested and in peak times slow.
To reduce congestion, Shanghai plans to construct 300 kilometres of expressway by 2005 and 650 kilometres by 2010.
The city now has about 240 kilometres of expressway in service.
Accessing the city centre and residential districts is still a challenge.
In an effort to control city transportation, large trucks are not allowed within certain areas at certain periods of time.
Special licenses may apply.
Roads in neighbourhoods are relatively small, and not built to accommodate large trucks.
Alternative distribution methods include smaller trucks, bicycle or motorcycles are used.
Rail Traditionally, the railway was the most used form of transportation.
It remains the cheapest form.
The railway networks covers a large geographic territory.
All provinces in China are connected through railway.
Rail continues to ship the majority of China's commodities (grains and coal).
The rail system continues to be overburdened with use.
Transport delays are common.
The China's State Planning Commission announced plans to construct an additional 6000 kms of new railway lines.
The current length is 71 000 kms of line.
An intermodal system between various forms of transportation is yet to be widely developed.
Plans to further develop and increase the effectiveness of the intermodal system have been discussed.
A key drawback to rail transportation is handling.
Of all available modes of transport, the damage rate is the highest.
Goods are brought by truck to the station, unloaded and switched to rail, off loaded at the final destination and loaded on a truck to reach the end-customer.
Handlers are notorious for mishandling goods.
In addition another problem occurs as key products as grain and coal, often have priority over consumer products.

• Industry has streamlined (tracking system, fixed schedules) Disadvantage Disadvantage
• Slow
• Bureaucratic
• High Damage Rage
• Coal and grain have priority
• Need to book space in advance
• Not flexible
• Ill equipped for inland transport
Packaging Given the above transportation infrastructure, it is no surprise that goods undergo rough transport and handling.
Good packaging is necessary to protect against the damage.
Goods should be packaged in tamper-resistant materials to protect against rough handling and bad weather.
Special arrangements will need to be made for special requirement goods.
Proper labelling on the goods (in both English and Chinese) will facilitate the transportation and import formalities.
Markings on containers should identify the buyer, the port of entry, gross and net weights, the country of origin, and any handling cautions (Fragile, Refrigerated).
A packing list identifying the contents of each container must also be included, and all markings must agree with those on the bill of lading (or other shipment documents).
FOOD MERCHANDISING The Retail System Over the last decade, the Chinese retail market has undergone remarkable growth, as well as significant, profound change.
The change has accelerated and facilitated the access of imported goods to the end consumer.
Traditionally, food products were purchased daily from local wet markets and dry goods from local state–run stores.
Western-style retail stores have begun to replace the traditional structure.
Today, food retail outfits house flashy displays and a complete set of goods in one location.
Hypermarkets, supermarkets and convenience stores have proliferated the city providing convenience, reasonable prices and improved sanitary conditions.
The Shanghai consumer has accepted the evolved system with enthusiasm.
Currently, there are over 3300 retail food outlets (over 700 square metres) operating in the city, of which 2000 were established in 2002.
Type of Store # of Stores Total Sales Market Sales of Store TOTAL 7700 70 billion Rmb 30% of consumption sales Supermarkets 2500 39.9 bilion Rmb 19.6 Convenience Stores 3500 4.5 billion Rmb 2.2 Hypermarkets 64 15.1 billion Rmb 7.4 Fast Food Outlets 490 2.3 billion Rmb 1.1 Others 1146 8.1 billion Rmb 4
Restaurant and Hotels Five Star hotels, stand-alone five star restaurants and fast food outlets have become and continue to become an integral element of Shanghai's food industry.
A vibrant hospitality industry has appeared in recent years catering to Chinese and foreign business people, residents and tourists.
The number of visitors (business and tourism) to Shanghai has grown, on average, 8% a year and is projected to reach 140 million by Expo 2010.
In 2002, Shanghai attracted 80 million domestic and international travellers to the city.
In 2002-2003 alone, the Four Seasons, the Hilton, the Westin, the Sofitel and the Shangri-La have all opened new ventures in the city.
The four and five star hotel, tourist and restaurant industry offers one of the largest opportunities for imported foods.
The need to cater to the varying international cuisine and food preferences of this growing sector has created opportunity and will continue to do so.
To date, imported food products enjoys a high penetration rate and is well accepted with these retailers.
Also, end users have the financial capital to purchase the more expensive food.
Hypermarkets and Discount Warehouse Stores Hypermarkets are one of the newest market players to the retail industry.
At their advent on the scene, sceptics quickly predicted their failure as Chinese traditionally bought daily, small purchases.
The store's ability to offer convenience, variety and low prices to the consumer won the loyalty and acceptance.
Today, there are over 50 hypermarkets operating in Shanghai.
Hypermarkets are normally foreign and joint venture owned.
Defined by size (7800 square meters plus) and product selection, a 'Hypermarket' is a large retail concern selling a wide variety of products from frozen goods to household products in one location.
One floor may also be dedicated to restaurants and services.
Stores are often two or three floors and have extensive frozen food, produce, fresh meat, fresh fish and household sections.
Additional features, such as bakeries, pre-made foods and alcoholic beverages are the norm.
Prices are kept down due to the unique nature of their distribution system.
Retail concerns, such as Carrefour or Wal-Mart (2003 Shanghai opening), are now planning to establish a nation-wide procurement system to further streamline their operations.
Effective supply chain management systems and foreign expertise also contribute to their success.
Hypermarkets are an important driving force for changes in the industry.
Distributors or importers are forced to up-date their systems and be effective.
To supplement their income further, hypermarkets charge high 'slotting' fees for goods to be displayed on their shelves.
The largest foreign presence is French based Carrefour.
Carrefour was one of the first retailers to enter the Chinese market and to pioneer the hypermarket movement.
Since 1994, they have opened 32 stores nationally; six of which are in Shanghai.
Metro, a German based retailer, is also prominent in the market.
At the moment, the largest presence of Canadian food is available at the Hongqiao Friendship Store.
Local Chinese retailers have quickly adjusted to the new process and have entered the market.
A 2003 merger of the four largest Shanghai state-owned retail outfits will create significant new competition in the hypermarket and supermarket industry.
The new "Bailian" group will command 4.6 billion Canadian in assets and possess a distribution network spanning 20 provinces.
The merger was viewed as necessary to consolidate in order the over-saturated retail industry and to provide significant competition to foreignors.
Though import food selection differs greatly by hypermarkets, these outlets are a good entry point for imported food.
Their target market has the disposable income to try new products.
In addition, their streamlined system is relatively easy to access and to navigate.
At present, the imported selection is relatively small, but is continually expanding.
Supermarkets The advent of supermarkets in the mid 1990's was the beginning of the retail revolution in Shanghai.
In 1991, the first supermarket opened its doors.
Today, in 2003, there are over 2500 supermarkets operating throughout the city representing the most widespread outlet for food procurement.
The largest supermarket operators are Chinese-owned companies.
The top leading companies in Shanghai are Lianhua and Hualian.
Each company also operates a set of convenience stores and hypermarkets.
Lianhua and Hualian are now members of the newly formed Bailian group.
Store Name # of Stores
Depending on the store, fresh produce and meat can also be purchased in the outlet.
While some of these retail outfits carry imported food, the penetration is rather low.
Foreign brands (Coke, Dove, Kit Kat) produced in China can be purchased from all stores.
Certain supermarkets as Parksons or City Supermarket, cater solely to expatriate and high-income Chinese by carrying exclusively imported products.
In 2001, 75% of supermarkets operated as part of a larger chain.
The Chain store approach facilitates and co-ordinates distribution.
Stores rely on close relationships with local food distributors.
The hypermarket distribution system remains the more effective of the two.
As the retail and distribution system continues to evolve and the acceptance of imported food deepens, penetration will also grow at the supermarket level.
Convenience Stores (C-stores) Convenience stores have and continue to sprout up on every street corner.
At present, there are over 3500 stores in Shanghai.
By 2005, the estimated number is 5000.
The majority of Shanghai's chain stores are locally owned, with the exception of a few foreign funded enterprises.
7-11 owns 30% of the Lawson stores.
The convenience store market in Shanghai is extremely competitive, and has limited room for expansion.
Convenience stores resemble their Canadian counterparts, offering a selection of convenience foods and groceries at slightly higher prices than supermarkets.
As in Canada, they often provide 24 hours services offering an array of hot, late night and early morning snack food.
It is important to note that convenience stores carry a majority of local products, or local foreign joint venture products.
Imported products rarely adorn the shelves.
Convenience stores are often operated by larger retail concerns, as supermarkets or other food producers.
For example, Kedi stores are owned and operated by Shanghai Bright Dairy & Food Corporation, the main dairy producer, processor and distributor in Shanghai.
Lianhua (Kuaike) and Hualian (Lawson) also operate a set of convenience chain stores.
Few independent stores exist in the market.
This link facilitates the distribution of goods as stores tap into the system of their larger counterpart.
Wet Markets Traditionally wet markets were the main centres for food procurement.
Fresh meat, fish, vegetables, fruit and grain can be purchased from a multitude of different vendors.
Wet markets predominantly cater to the low-income and older population, as prices are low and the produce fresh.
Purchases are generally small and intended only for daily consumption.
Although, today wet markets are declining in importance, they still remain an important source for food procurement.
The majority of fruit and vegetable purchases continue to be made at this level.
Wet markets are found throughout Shanghai and outlying areas.
They tend to be located on side streets and back lanes.
Kiosks Small kiosks are often found on street corners or hidden in back lanes.
Kiosk shelves are crammed with a miscellaneous assortment of goods.
Neighbourhood patrons or passer-bys' purchase small convenience goods such as a beverage product, cigarettes, snacks, instant noodles or tissue.
Imported foods have not reached this level of the retail structure.
Purchase amounts are normally quite small, as patrons do the majority of their food shopping at bigger retail outlets as the supermarket or hypermarket.
Kiosks are normally owned and operated by independent families.
Family members are responsible for the procurement of the products in their stall.
Accessing and distributing to this sector of the retail section is complicated, costly and time consuming.
The independent nature, the size and physical locations of the kiosks makes distribution a key problem.
Department Stores Modern day department stores, similar to the Hudson's Bay of Canada often have one or two floors dedicated to food sales.
Normally department stores are operated as independent units and sell the same products as the supermarkets or hypermarkets.
The Department stores primary purpose is not to sell food products, but to sell a host of products from clothing to electronics.
Food retail is an added convenience for the shopper.
Depending on the store, a certain degree of mported products are sold in this medium.
The Local Consumer The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates that imported foods account for less than 5% of food stocks in Chinese hypermarkets and supermarkets.
This percent does not include foreign brands produced in China such as Nestlé or Coca-Cola products.
Leading retail chains are beginning to diversify their product range, and increasingly carry import foods.
In general, imported food is purchased by the middle-upper income younger Chinese.
Import food purchases are often made out of curiosity to try something new or as a gift to relatives or friends.
As a result, repeat sales are more difficult to achieve than the first.
Price, brand and quality remain the leading decision making factors.
As any global market, consumer preferences need to be closely examined before formulating a market entry strategy.
Canadian exporters are advised to perform thorough market research before entering the market.
Research is needed to clearly understand the end consumer and their preferences.
A common misconception is that the Chinese market in one market.
In reality, it is a series of local, regional markets.
Trends vary from one city to another.
Cities to watch are Shanghai, Beijing and Guanzhou.
Marketing your Product Advertisements for Coke or Pepsi are splashed on the side of buses; Juicy Fruit gum commercials dance across television screens; and USA grown oranges are painted on the city's towering billboards.
The key is to find an outlet and an image that appeals to the Chinese consumer.
Developing and marketing a brand is increasingly important.
Creating a recognisable brand will make the difference between success and failure.
Branding is a relatively new concept in China's retail sector.
Prior to 1980s, no real brands existed in the market.
Today, brand names have become one of the top decision making factors influencing consumer-purchasing decisions.
Evian water or Pringles potato chips are repeatedly chosen over others, as consumer identify with the name and quality of the product.
Recognizing the importance, Chinese producers have also jumped into the game and are building effective brand names for their products.
Premium branding will assist in ensuring repeat purchases of the product.
An important element of promotion is education.
Western products are often new to Chinese culture and taste.
Certain products require significant education.
For example, historically, dairy products have been viewed as a supplement for the young, weak and elderly.
The challenge is now in convincing the society of the importance at all age levels.
A western product may need to employ a different strategy in China.
For example, Canadians know and use peanut butter as a spread on bread.
Other key elements of effective marketing are ensuring the product is attractively packaged, Chinese language information correct and catchy advertisement slogans are used.
Brightly coloured, innovative packaging will help differentiate the product on the shelf.
As the majority of residents, walk or bicycle to the store, package size should be relatively small.
Special care should be given in translation and Chinese language information.
For example, Coca-Cola's success can be attributed partly to its Chinese name.
Coke's Chinese name is "Ke Kou Ke Le", which means 'delicious and happiness'.
Imported products may consider including Chinese language information on its origin, potential use and recipes.
Recognising the importance of marketing and promotional activities, exporters should not rely on their distributor to provide such service.
Distributors are 'order takers', and do not necessarily have the resources or the money to provide added services.
Exporters may want to develop their own marketing strategy, or provide additional finances or promotional material to their distributor to assist in marketing their product.
In-store promotions and taste tests have been successful in introducing products to the market.
Pricing Although, the Shanghainese are among the wealthiest people in China, price remains an important factor in their purchasing decision.
Consumers are willing to pay higher prices for imported food, as it is often viewed as having higher quality and consumers are curious to try something different.
Imported food should be priced to maintain its exclusivity, while at the same time not outside an affordable price range for consumers.
With exception to certain products, as ginseng, wine or chocolate, where consumers are willing to purchase at much higher prices providing they believe in the quality and value of the product.
The following table provides the prices on various imports, foreign brands locally produced and local products.
Product Size Import/Made in China Average Price
Rmb Cnd Pringles 184gr Import 14.00 2.26 Oishi Potato Chips 70gr China 3.20 0.52 Newman's Own Pretzels 226gr Import 22.50 3.63 Danone Soda Crackers 100gr China 1.90 0.31 Glico Pocky Sticks 65gr China 3.30-4.00 0.53-0.64 Chips O'Hoy 95gr China 3.10 0.50 Kieldsens Denmark Cookies 125gr Import 14.00 2.26 Evian Bottled Water 500ml Import 7 1.13 Nongfu Springs 550ml China 1.20 0.19 Coke/Pepsi 600ml China 2.50 0.42 Dove Chocolate 47gr China 6 0.97 Belgium Chocolate 200-250gr Import 60 9.67 Taste Creating products that target the Chinese taste are key to success.
Significant market research is required to determine and match local consumer preferences.
For example, a leading brand's plain potato chip has a small amount of sugar in the ingredients.
Popular chip brands include seaweed, shrimp, roasted pork or curry, whereas in Canada, they are Ketchup and Sour Cream and Onion.
Another example is the popularity of Aloe Vera yoghurt on the market.
The Chinese eat Aloe Vera in a variety of dishes, and believe in its health benefits.
Though not necessary, products catering to local tastes have enjoyed greater success.
In store Requirements In-shore promotion has proven to be successful for the promotion of imported products.
Taste tests are a good mechanism to promote the product at the store level.
Food festivals are also popular.
Festivals are organised individually by the store or with the partnership of a private, or foreign public actor.
Annually, the Canadian Consulate General in Shanghai organises a Canadian food festival in one of the leading retail stores in the city.
The goal of the festival is to promote Canadian value-added food products in Shanghai.
Promotion and marketing alone are not always enough to establish a product in the market.
There are a number of other in-store factors that are crucial for success.
The product must be constantly available, stocked in good condition and displayed correctly.
Products requiring cold storage facilities may encounter problems.
The distributor must constantly maintain relationships with the store and check the status of the product.
The store will not provide any additional services.
Due diligence on distributors is fundamental, if frustrating, requirements that will help alleviate this problem.
It is also a worthy investment to pay the 'slotting fee' for friendly eye-level shelf space.
The customer will not be able to miss the product.
"Slotting fees" are a common practice in China retail outlets, and a constant issue between suppliers and retailers.
The slotting fee is not necessary shelf placement, but the right to enter into the store's product portfolio.
As more and more products rush to the market, current rates are increasingly steeply.
• Imported food accounts for 5% of total food stocks in Chinese hypermarket and supermarkets.
• Imported brands produced in China have greater success.
They are able to compete on price, market awareness and production costs.
• Price, taste and branding are key elements to understanding the Shanghainese consumer.
As any market, consumer preferences vary immensely from the Canadian market.
Effective and adequate market research should be performed to ensure an understanding of the market.

OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FOOD MARKETS OF INDIA PURPOSE The purpose of this paper is to provide Canadian food exporters with indications of opportunities or "contestable markets" in India.
The paper uses several indicators of contestability and ranks product groups according to the number of positive indicators associated with each.
The paper provides indications only.
Individual companies should follow up on opportunities of interest with: further market research, including the determination of quality and packaging of competing products; acquisition of information on sanitary/phyto-sanitary and labelling requirements; the development of a research price work-up; other barriers to trade and; eventually a specific price workup.
The indicators of contestability used in this paper are based on historical statistics and therefore assume Indian tastes and preferences are fixed.
It also assumes that the images that Indian consumers have of Canada and Canadian products are fixed and not always positive relative to the images of competing products.
The Branding Strategy for the Canadian Agriculture and Food Sector1 is designed to improve knowledge of Canadian products and food systems, to differentiate Canada from its competitors and establish a reputation for high quality.
This program can have a major positive influence on Indian acceptance of Canadian food products and increase the probabilities of finding opportunities in Indian markets.
BUSINESS PARADIGMS There are several ways in which Canadian companies can participate in the food markets of India.
Some understanding of the competitive nature of the Indian food markets is necessary for Canadian companies to decide on the appropriate paradigm for them.
A. The Competitive Environment In 2003, the packaged food market was dominated by a few multi-national companies and many local manufacturers.
There was also a thriving unorganised sector consisting of many small entities.
The market was highly competitive and fragmented.
Even the large multinationals had to fight hard to maintain market positions.
As the rural areas became increasingly important, companies engaged in various promotional offers.
Smaller packs at low prices were key to growth in sales of such products as bakery products, soup, noodles, and confectionery products.
B. Pure Export The paradigm assumed in this paper is characterised by production in Canada by Canadian companies with sea or air transport to India by any available carrier.
Canadian companies normally cease to be interested in a shipment when it is loaded onto a ship and payment is received.
C. Export with Agreements This paradigm is much the same as pure export except that Canadian companies enter into various kinds of agreements with Indian companies to perform any one or more marketing functions such as wholesaling, storage, distributing, advertising and/or retailing.
Multi-nationals operate as if there were no borders, placing production plants in the most economic position in relation to sources of inputs and the markets to be served.
Tariffs and other trade barriers are a cost of doing business and influence the placement of production plants based only on economic and financial considerations.
With barriers to trade falling, these companies are in the best position to adjust and benefit from the comparative advantages of many countries.
Some multi-national companies active in India are 2:
It has a significant presence in bakery products, particularly biscuits.
In early 2002, Cadbury Schweppes of the UK obtained 90% of the shares of Cadbury India Ltd.
In 2003, the UK company obtained the remaining 10% and de-listed the shares.
The company has had a presence in India for over a century and is the third largest manufacturer of food in India, after the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation and Danone.
PROFILE OF INDIA A. Geography India is located in Southern Asia with the Arabian sea to the west, the Bay of Bengal to the east and the Indian Ocean to the south.
On the north-west it is bordered by Pakistan, on the north by China, Nepal, and Bhutan.
With an area of 3,287,590 Km2 3, it is almost one-third the size of Canada.
India can be divided into three main regions: the Himalayan Mountains, the Gangetic Plain, and Peninsular India.
The Himalayan Mountains The Himalayan mountain system is 160 to 320 km wide and extends 2,400 km along the northern and eastern borders of India.
It includes the mountains surrounding the Vale of Kashmir in the Karakoram Range, and the central and eastern Himalayas.
Ancient geological forces moulded the Himalayas as the Indian plate of the Earth’s crust subducted under the Eurasian landmass, creating an uplift that continues to push this northernmost boundary of India ever higher.
The Himalayan Range is the highest mountain system in the world.
The Himalayan region, including the foothills, is sparsely settled.
Agriculture and animal herding are the main economic activities.
The Gangetic Plain South of, and parallel to the Himalayas, lies the Gangetic Plain, a belt of flat, alluvial lowlands 280 to 400 km wide.
This area includes some of the most agriculturally productive land in India.
The Indian portion of the broad Gangetic Plain encompasses several river systems, and stretches from Punjab state in the west to the Assam Valley in the east.
Marking the western end of the Gangetic Plain are the Indus River and its tributaries, including the Sutlej and Chenab rivers, which flow through Punjab in India’s northwest corner.
The Gangetic Plain is formed by the Ganges River and its tributaries, which drain the southern slopes of the Himalayas.
The Assam Valley is separated from the Gangetic Plain by a narrow corridor of land near the city of Darjeeling.
The valley is watered by the Brahmaputra River, which rises in Tibet and crosses into India at its northeast corner, then flows north of the Khasi Hills into 3
Peninsular India South of the plains region lies Peninsular India.
The northern peninsula features a series of mountain ranges and plateaus.
The Aravalli Range runs in a north-south direction on the eastern edge of the Thar Desert, and low hills cut by valleys lie along the border between the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh in central India.
The Narmada River flows southwest between the Vindhya Range and an associated plateau on the north, and the Satpura Range on the south.
The plains of the Chota Nagpur Plateau in the eastern states of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand also lie within this region.
The rocky and uneven lands of the northern peninsula are sparsely populated.
Herding is a major occupation in the west, and farming of coarse grains such as millet is common in the central part.
In the southern part of peninsular India lies the vast Deccan Plateau, a tableland lying within a triangle formed by the Satpura Range, the steep mountain slopes of the Western Ghats, and the gentler slopes of the Eastern Ghats.
Elevations in the plateau region average 600 m, although outcroppings as high as 1,200 m occur.
At their northern end, the Western Ghats vary in height from 900 to 1,200 m, but the Nilgiri Hills of the extreme south reach a height of 2,637 m at Doda Betta, their highest peak.
The Eastern Ghats lie along the eastern flank of the Deccan Plateau, interrupted by the Krishna and Godavari river basins.
The Indian Peninsula is bordered by a mostly fertile seashore.
The west coast, including the extensive Gujarat Plain in the north, the thin Konkan shore in Maharashtra state, and the Malabar Coast in the south, support substantial populations of farmers and fishermen.
Ancient trade routes to the west helped make the cities and towns of this region into market centers for textiles and spices.
The east coast’s broad alluvial plains, stretching from the Kaveri River delta in the south to the Mahanadi River delta in the north, are intensely farmed.4
B. Demography The population of India is estimated to be 1,080,264,388 (2005).
An exponential trend line fitted to the population data from 1992 to 2005 indicates an annual rate of increase of 1.65%.
The age/gender distribution of the population is presented in the population pyramid of Figure 1.
The largest sized age groups are between 0 and 19 years of age.
A sampling of traditional Indian cuisines and the products that might by supplied by Canada is presented in Table 1.

This data indicates that there were 63 million households classified as "well-off" and "affluent".
Of these, 34.3 million were located in urban areas while 28.7 million were in rural areas.
In Canadian Dollars, 30.0 20.0 10.0 0.0 Destitute Aspirants Climbers Well-off INCOME CLASS Rural Urban
These classifications were based on Indian prices in 1998/1999.
Milk is purchased daily.
It is estimated7 that only 15% the potential market for refrigerators has been exploited.
As increasing numbers of Indians purchase refrigerators, the buying patterns of groceries will change.
Grocery stores are the dominant food outlets but fruit and vegetables are bought from unorganized vendors.
Some grocery chains are expanding into the supermarket or hypermarket category offering a wide range of products; however, purchasing of fruit and vegetables in this context has not yet been fully accepted.
Even so, supermarkets and hypermarkets are putting pressure on the traditional grocery store.
Visits to a supermarket encourage much impulse buying compared to visits to a traditional grocery store or phone shopping.
Eating out is a very popular activity while attending other functions.
Of this, organized establishments accounts for only INR 20 billion (CAD 0.6 billion).
International fast food chains such as Subway, McDonald’s and Pizza Hut are found in shopping malls and near cinema theatres.
The "well-off" in urban areas are increasingly eating out in coffee shops, malls or retail stores.
Lounge bars are the latest trend in urban areas and are frequented by young professionals, successful executives and single women in their late 20's.
This trend began in Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi and Kolkata and will no doubt spread to other urban areas.
Among the "affluent", clubs are becoming popular.
In addition to many recreational facilities they are upgrading their food facilities and can compete with some of the finest restaurants or hotels of India.
The "affluent" also have an interest in the performing arts.
Middle to upper income families are increasingly two income, younger families.
A small proportion of Indian families are moving to quick ready-to-eat foods and frozen foods.
However 90% of the population still prefers fresh foods and consider processed foods to be not fresh and containing harmful preservatives.
Table 2 presents estimates of the consumption of packaged and processed foods.
Bread had the highest estimated consumption level in 2003, (1,656.5 gms per person).
The consumption of crisps/chips was the fastest growing food sector from 1998 to 2003 (77.82% over the 8
5 year period) although the level of consumption was still low (9.96 gms per person).
Similarly, the consumption of pasta increased 76.3 % from 1998 reaching 0.705 gms per person in 2003.
Both chips/crisps and pasta are popular among consumers below 19 years of age.
Pasta is also popular with mothers as a snack for school-age children.
Euromonitor from trade sources.
Noodles: dried noodles and instant noodles; Oils: olive oil and vegetable and seed oil; Other fats: cooking fats, butter, margarine and spreadable oils and fats; Pasta: dried pasta, canned pasta and chilled/fresh pasta; Soup: canned, chilled, dehydrated and instant soup. n/a = Not available.
Religions and Philosophies Table 3 presents a list of the major religions and philosophies of India and their food preferences.
Vegetarianism is often strongly associated with India and several religions do include it as one if their requirements.
However, many Indians eat meat of some kind according to what their religion allows and others do not adhere strictly to food rules.
There are markets in India for meat products.

Historical Development The Indus Valley civilization dates back at least 5,000 years.
Services are the major source of economic growth, though two-thirds of the workforce is in agriculture.
The government has committed to furthering economic reforms and developing the basic infrastructure to improve the lives of the rural poor and boost economic performance.
Government controls on foreign trade and investment have been reduced in some areas, but high tariffs (averaging 20% in 2004) and limits on foreign direct investment are still in place.
The government has indicated it will do more to liberalize investment in civil aviation, telecom, and insurance sectors in the near term.
Privatization of government-owned industries has proceeded slowly, and continues to generate political debate; continued social, political, and economic rigidities hold back needed initiatives.
The economy posted an excellent average growth rate since 1994, reducing poverty by about 10 percentage points.
Despite strong growth, the World Bank and others worry about the combined state and federal budget deficit.
The federal debt alone is running at approximately 59.7% of GDP in 2004.
The huge and growing population is the fundamental social, economic, and environmental problem.
In late December 2004, a major tsunami hit and destroyed part of the southern and eastern coasts of India taking at least 60,000 lives, caused massive destruction of property, and severely affected the fishing fleet.
Determinants of Food Demand Quantitatively, the rate of increase in the effective demand for agricultural, agri-food & seafood products is influenced by the rates of change of: population, product prices, income per person and income distribution.
Qualitatively, the types of products demanded by consumers are determined by their tastes and preferences which are in turn influenced by the cultures that make up today’s India and their knowledge and acceptance of foreign cuisines.
Income level also has an important influence on the level of quality demanded.
Between 1992 and 2005 the Indian population was increasing at a rate of 1.65% per year.
According to data from the Office of the Registrar General and the Reserve Bank of India, GDP per person was CAD 519 in 2001.
World Bank data indicates that it was USD 641 (CAD 834) in 2004, and between 1999 and 2004 the GDP per person grew at a rate of 4.96% per year.
Income was less equally distributed, individually and geographically, than in many other countries.
The level of income inequality among families is indicated by the Gini ratio11 of 37.8 in 1997, (compared to Canada’s ratio of 31.5 in 1994).
Of all the Indian states/union territories for which data is available, Bihar had the lowest average Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) per person of CAD 180 in 2001.
Goa had the highest NSDP per person of CAD 1,608.
Consumer prices are estimated to be increasing at an annual rate of 4.2% (2004)12.
Determinants of Food Imports Many factors influence the amount of food imported into a country including: total food demand, productive capacity, exchange rate movements and various trade barriers.
The capacity of a country to produce food is in turn influenced by the agricultural and fishery resources it possesses, the levels of technology and the number of managers with modern management skills.
TIME Figure 3.
Exchange Rate Between the Indian Rupee and the Canadian Dollar (CAD per INR).
India is a major food consumer due to the size of its population.
Based on the continuing rapidly increase in population and the increase of GDP or NSDP per person, the effective demand for food can be expected to continue to increase.
The major source of supply will continue to be the Indian economy but imports will increase as the Indian "middle class" expands, receives higher incomes and become increasingly eclectic in its tastes.
This is occurring rapidly in some states.
From January 1995 to October 2005, the value of the INR (see Figure 3)was decreasing at a rate of -0.32% per month (-3.82% per year).
This slow decrease in value was making Canadian food products increasingly expensive for Indian consumers although the slow rate may have allowed the Indian economy to adjust, having only a small effect on food imports.
Before the 1970's, India was heavily dependent on food imports.
Today it is not only self-sufficient in grain production but has a substantial reserve.
The progress made by Indian agriculture in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s has been one of the biggest success stories since independence.
In the 1970s there was a multi-fold increase in wheat production which became known as the Green Revolution.
This increase in agricultural production was accomplished by bringing additional land under cultivation, extension of irrigation facilities, the use of improved high yielding varieties of seeds, better techniques developed through agricultural research, water management, and plant protection through 24
According to FAO data, in 1961 the Indian population consumed an average of 2,072 calories, 53.4 gms of protein and 31.3 gms of fat per day.
By 2002 they were consuming 2,459 calories (18.7% increase), 57.3 gms of protein (7.3% increase) and 49.6 gms of fat (59.4% increase) per person per day.
The region had an estimated population of 287.0 million (2001) and an estimated 2001 NSDP per person of CAD 373 per year.
Six jurisdictions had estimated values of NSDP per person higher than the country average.
Mizoram is also an important market with an estimated 2001 NSDP of CAD 651 per person and an estimated population of 888,573.
Chandigarh; Delhi; Haryana; Himachal Pradesh; Jammu & Kashmir; Punjab; Rajasthan; Uttar Pradesh and; Uttaranchal.
The region had an estimated population of 307.7 million (2001) and an estimated 2001 NSDP per person of CAD 490.
Five of the jurisdictions had estimated values of NSDP per person higher than the country average.
The most attractive market in this region is Chandigarh State which had the highest estimated 2001 NSDP per person (CAD 1,591) in the region and an estimated 900,635 people.
Delhi is also an important market with an estimated 2001 NSDP of CAD 1,447 per person and an estimated population of 13.9 million.
The region had an estimated population of 224.3 million (2001) and an estimated 2001 NSDP per person of CAD 616.
The most attractive market in this region is Pondicherry which has the highest estimated 2001 NSDP per person (CAD 1,240) in the region and an estimated 2001 population of 974,345 people.
Tamil Nadu is also an important market with an estimated annual NSDP per person of CAD 622 and an estimated population of 62.4 million.
The region had an estimated population of 209.6 million (2001) and an estimated 2001 NSDP per person of CAD 659.
The most attractive market in this region is Goa which had the highest 2001 NSDP per person (CAD 1,608) in the region and an estimated population of 1.3 million.
Maharashtra is also an important market with an estimated 2001 NSDP per person of CAD 790 and an estimated population of 96.9 million.
Regional Retail Markets for Packaged Food 13 The 35 states and union territories of India differ greatly in natural resources, religion, language, culture, food habits, living standards and purchasing power.
As a result there are important differences among regions in the demand for packaged food.
For a summary of 2003 sales and volumes by sector by region see Table A1-4.
Table 8 presents the CAD values of sales of packaged food from 1999 to 2004.
Value of Retail Sales of Packaged Food by Region.
Packaged food data for 2004 is based on part-year estimates and is provisional.
* Rates of increase of an exponential trend line fitted to the data.
The East & Northeast region is the least developed area and has the lowest per capita income of the four regions.
Consumers prefer to purchase food from wet markets or through the unbranded channel.
The unorganized channel is of major importance in this region and branded food manufacturers are still adjusting their marketing mix.
Retail sales of packaged food in East & Northeast India is expected to increase at an annual compound rate of 5.73% (on an INR basis) between 2004 and 2009 reaching INR 86.74 billion.
This region is expected to experience the fastest growth from the smallest 2004 base.
North India generates significant sales of such segments as bakery products, ice cream, sweet and savoury snacks, and dried processed food.
Demand growth in North India is driven by increasing disposable incomes, the need for convenience food and increasing acceptance of western cuisine.
These shifts are particularly apparent in rural areas.
Consumers are moving from cheaper, unbranded products sold through the unorganised channel to packaged food.
Retail sales of packaged food in North India is expected to increase at an annual compound rate of 4.22% (on an INR basis) between 2004 and 2009 reaching INR 139.32 billion.
The majority of South Indians have very conservative dietary habits, and tend to consume local cuisines.
Retail sales of packaged food in South India is expected to increase at an annual compound rate of 4.78% (on an INR basis) between 2004 and 2009 reaching INR 115.96 billion.
The population in West India has the highest per capita income of the four regions and are sophisticated consumers with a high level of product awareness.
They are willing to accept and experiment with foreign foods such as: pastas, soup, breakfast cereals, sauces such as mayonnaise and salad dressings.
Chinese and Italian cuisines are also accepted.
Retail sales of packaged food in West India are expected to increase at a compound rate of 4.03% per year (on an INR basis) between 2004 and 2009 reaching INR 144.22 billion.

Note:
a) Confectionery Products In 2003, Indian consumers purchased INR 26.86 billion (CAD 807.87 million) worth of packaged confectionery products.
The largest market, by value, for these products was South India where INR 8.01 billion (CAD 240.92 million) worth was sold.
In 2003, South India had the highest level of per capita consumption at 174 gms, worth INR 34.55, followed by West India at 152 gms per person worth INR 32.27.
Consumers in this region have a preference for milk-sweetened confections and toffees, caramels and nougats.
Other popular confections include: power mints, medicated confections such as cough drops and chewing gum sold as mouth fresheners.
Consumers in North India are replacing traditional chewing paan with youth-oriented breath fresheners like power mints and chewing gum.
Chocolate confections were popular but tablets and boxed assortments have suffered a setback due to a widely publicized contamination incident in 2003.
Eventually the demand will return to normal growth.
Marketing in North India is based much more on relationships rather than the professional mechanisms operating in the South.
It is forecast that by 2009, Indians will purchase INR 35.05 billion worth of packaged confectionery products with South India consumers buying 49.54 thousand tonnes worth INR 9.98 billion.
By 2009, South India is expected to have the highest level of per capita consumption of 194 gms worth INR 39.03 followed by West India at 168 gms / capita worth INR 37.00.

North India is expected to account for 35% of bakery sales in 2004.
Many traditional home-made breads in this region are made from wheat flour so the shift to mass produced wheat breads is being made easily.
Biscuits are also relatively popular in the North.
Consumers are price sensitive; consequently lower priced products receive greater acceptance.
Consumers in modern and cosmopolitan West India have a higher proportion of dual-income households and there is a cultural move away from the extended family toward nuclear families.
Bakery products finding strong consumer demand in this region are: breakfast cereals, cakes and biscuits.
It is forecast that by 2009, Indians will purchase INR 151.35 billion worth of packaged bakery products, with North Indian consumers buying 997.83 thousand tonnes worth INR 48.89 billion.

Flavoured powdered milk is popular in this region.
e) Sweet and Savoury Snacks In 2003, Indian consumers purchased INR 7.09 billion (CAD 213.25 million) worth of sweet and savoury snacks.
The largest market, by value, for these products was West India where INR 2.30 billion (CAD 69.18 million) worth were sold.
The second largest market was North India with sales of INR 2.26 billion (CAD 67.97 million).
The North and West Indian regions account for almost 65% of snacks purchased in India.

In East & Northeast India as well as South India, milk is in short supply.
A very basic convalescent drink is used as a substitute for fresh milk in these regions.
The second largest market is expected to be East & Northeast India with sales of 4.60 thousand tonnes worth INR 1.28 billion.
The second largest market was North India with sales of INR 191 million (CAD 5.75 million).
West India had the highest level of per capita consumption of 8 gms per person worth INR 1.03, followed by both North and South India at 4 gms per person worth INR 0.60 and 0.68 respectively.
By 2009, West India is expected to have the highest level of per capita consumption at 27 gms worth INR 3.46, followed by South India at 19 gms per person worth INR 3.56.
The growth in demand for soup in West India will be based on increasing demand for canned brands by higher income groups as they move from powdered soups.
In North India, the main engine of growth will be increased market penetration in urban areas and to a lesser extent in rural areas.
Dehydrated soup will continue to be the predominant form.
It is forecast that by 2009, Indians will purchase INR 663 million worth of soup with North Indians buying 0.710 thousand tonnes worth INR 214 million.

All regions of India except the East & Northeast had a level of per capita consumption of 1 gm with values ranging from INR 0.05 to INR 0.12.
North & Northeast India consumed less than 1 gm per person worth INR 0.04.
West India will experience continued growth in pasta sales based on the relatively prosperous population which is well educated, well travelled and open to new cuisines.
The increasing variety of pasta sauces will also promote sales.
Consumers in North India will accept pasta more slowly than consumers in other regions; however, some growth will occur based on affluent households willing to experiment with new food 37
In South India, the growth of pasta sales will be based on the portion of the population described as young and trendy.
They have a preference for Italian or Chinese flavours and many Italian restaurants and pizza parlours are opening.
New pasta varieties are entering the urban supermarkets adding somewhat to demand.
The conservative eating habits of the majority of consumers in South India will relegate it to a niche market.
It is forecast that by 2009, Indians will purchase INR 127 million worth of pasta with West Indians buying 0.46 thousand tonnes worth INR 48.01 million.
By 2009, West India is expected to have the highest level of per capita consumption at 2 gms per person worth INR 0.20, followed by all other Indian regions at 1 gm per person with values ranging from INR 0.06 to INR 0.11.

The largest market, by value, was West India where INR 1.189 billion (CAD 35.77 million) worth was sold.

Growth in North India will be fuelled by: changing preferences of two-income families; busy consumers accepting the convenience of instant noodles and; historically, consumers in North India are more familiar with noodles than consumers in other regions.
During the period 2004 to 2009 this region is expected to have the slowest growth rate of noodle sales of the four regions.
It is forecast that by 2009, Indians will purchase INR 9.421 billion worth of noodles with North Indians buying 29.59 thousand tonnes worth INR 2.761 billion.
The second largest market, by value, is expected to be West India with sales of 24.15 thousand tonnes worth INR 2.314 billion.
Total Volume (Thousand Tonnes).
Volume per Person (Gms per Person).
The second largest market was South India with sales of INR 415 million (CAD 12.48 million).
The main factor driving the demand for canned / preserved food in West India will be the generally better educated and busy professionals with higher incomes.
West Indian consumers are more willing to experiment with new foods than consumers in other regions.
While the population of South India are generally conservative, the portion of consumers with busy lifestyles such as young professionals, bachelors and working women will drive sales of easy-to-prepare and instant canned and preserved food, particularly ready meals, canned meat and canned fish.
It is forecast that by 2009, Indians will purchase INR 4.22 billion worth of canned / preserved products with West Indians buying 11.79 thousand tonnes worth INR 1.19 billion.
The second largest market, by value, is expected to be South India with sales of 8.40 thousand tonnes worth INR 1.12 billion.
By 2009, West India is expected to have the highest level of per capita consumption of 49 gms worth INR 4.98, followed by South India at 33 gms per person worth INR 4.38.
The largest market, by value, was West India where INR 1.40 billion (CAD 41.96 million) worth was sold.
The second largest market was North India with sales of INR 1.30 billion (CAD 38.95 million).
By 2009, West India is expected to have the highest level of per capita consumption of 49 gms per person worth INR 9.67, followed by North India at 32 gms per person worth INR 6.48.
East & Northeast Total Volume (Thousand Tonnes).
West India had the highest level of per capita consumption of 292 gms per person worth INR 17.50, followed by South India at 219 gms per person worth INR 14.67.
North India is expected to maintain its position as the largest market for dried and processed food primarily because of the size of its population.
By 2009, West India is expected to have the highest level of per capita consumption at 433 gms per person worth INR 26.11, followed by South India at 344 gms per person worth INR 23.85.
Calculations based on Euromonitor forecasts.
n) Oils and Fats In 2003, Indian consumers purchased INR 73.29 billion (CAD 2.20 billion) worth of oils and fats.
The largest market, by value, was West India where INR 24.12 billion (CAD 725.47 million) worth was sold.
The second largest market was North India with sales of INR 19.87 billion (CAD 597.64 million).
West India had the highest level of per capita consumption of 1.805 kgs worth INR 111.36, followed by South India at 1.24 kgs per person worth INR 71.53.
In West India, consumers who can afford it are moving to what are perceived safer, branded oils and fats.
The growth of sales in North India will be based on: its population growth and; a growing demand for branded food items.
New branded alternatives to unbranded oils and fats will be a very important factor in the sales growth of packaged oils and fats.
Olive oil is expensive in India partly because of a 50% import tariff.
Imports and sales are expected to increase as the duties an tariffs decrease.
Medium and upper income groups in both North (particularly Delhi) and West India will likely increase purchases of olive oil as a healthy alternative to other oils.
Sales per Person (INR/Person).
Volume per Person (Gms per Person).
In North India this niche category will experience particular growth in pickled products and packaged herbs.
Consumers are expected to move to the higher quality branded pickles and away from unbranded pickles.
Competition among three manufacturers of branded ketchup is expected to lower its price to an extent where consumers will move away from local unbranded products.
Penetration in rural markets will also increase sales.
In South India the primary driver of the sales will be new companies entering niche positions - not competing directly with the products of larger companies.
Other influences will be the increased exposure of the population to western cuisines resulting from the decreasing tariffs under WTO requirements.
It is forecast that by 2009, Indians will purchase INR 20.71 billion worth of sauces, dressings & condiments with North Indians buying 34.37 thousand tonnes worth INR 6.04 billion.
The second largest market is expected to be South India with sales of 49.54 thousand tonnes worth INR 5.86 billion.
By 2009, South India is expected to have the highest level of per capita consumption at 194 gms worth INR 22.92, followed by West India at 139 gms per person worth INR 19.67.
Population forecasts are based on an annual increase of 1.65%.
p) Baby Food In 2003, Indian consumers purchased INR 3.26 billion (CAD 97.95 million) worth of baby food.
The largest market, by value, was East & Northeast India where INR 1.150 billion (CAD 34.58 million) worth was sold.
The second largest market was South India with sales of INR 858 million (CAD 25.81 million).
East & Northeast India had the highest level of per capita consumption at 19 gms worth INR 3.88, followed by South India at 18 gms per person worth INR 3.70.
While the East & Northeast and South regions are and will remain the largest markets for baby food through 2009, they will experience the lowest rates of growth.
In the East & Northeast region, this low rate of growth is attributed to the promotion of the importance of breast feeding.
Areas where malnutrition of the nursing mother makes her milk insufficient or unfit for the baby continue to rely on prepared baby food products.
The largest market, by value, was West India where INR 871 million (CAD 26.19 million) worth was sold.
The second largest market was North India with sales of INR 598 million (CAD 17.99 million).
West India had the highest level of per capita consumption at 30 gms worth INR 4.02, followed by North India at 15 gms per person worth INR 1.88.
West India is the largest and fastest growing regional market for spreads.
Also, the region has more working women with families who are not averse to quick continental breakfasts.
The size of the market for spreads in the North India region is primarily due to the size of its population.
However, the market for packaged spreads is growing very slowly because of the large unorganized sales (particularly honey).
There are also taste and price incompatibilities.
It is forecast that by 2009, Indians will purchase INR 2.69 billion worth of spreads with West Indians buying 8.27 thousand tonnes worth INR 1.16 billion.
The second largest market is expected to be North India with sales of 5.34 thousand tonnes worth INR 723.21 million.
See Table 26.
Although this is essentially an internal situation it can, at times, interrupt the flow of imports and negatively affect the solvency of Indian importers.
C. Handling Risks of International Trade Some risks are normally covered by commercial cargo insurance in accordance with minimum cover of the Institute Cargo Clauses (Institute of London Underwriters) or some similar clause.
This insurance normally covers the standard risks involved in transporting goods, such as accidents and weather.
If a Canadian exporter expects to incur costs, or receive payment, in INRs consideration may be given to hedging against currency risks by participating in the futures market.
This strategy is not appropriate in all situations and the exporter should obtain advice from a bank or other trusted expert.
Additional risks might be covered by Accounts Receivable Insurance and other products similar to those offered by Export Development Canada (EDC).
The availability, terms and costs of this insurance will depend on conditions in the importing country, the reputation of the importer and EDC policy.

Agri-Food Consumer Profile Japan June 2006
The Government of Canada has prepared this report based on the primary source of Euromonitor Global Market supplementary information database and secondary sources of information.
Japan Agri-Food Consumer Profile April 2006 Overview Japan is the world’s 3rd largest economy and has an affluent consumer base in excess of 120 million.
Japan’s total food market is estimated to be over US$600 billion, with annual imports of US$70 billion in agri-food products.
Japan has 12 urban centres with populations exceeding 1 million.
The largest markets are in the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka and Nagoya.
Japanese consumers are well educated and technologically driven.
Consumers demand innovative and quality food products.
An increase in health awareness is driving a relatively new, but strong organic and functional food market, creating significant opportunity for Canadian exporters.
• Japan’s population of almost 128 million residents grows at a very slight 0.02% annually.
Immigration to Japan has traditionally been very low, and as a result the population can be characterized as homogenous.
Japan has the highest life expectancy of all the OECD countries reaching 82 years.
Lower incidents of heart disease-related deaths account for the higher life expectancy rates.
Japan is becoming a "childless society" as a result of one child families and an increase in single person households and later age marriages.
Average birthing age rose to 33 in 2003 from 28 in 1990.
The median age is almost 43 years.
Due to low birth rates, the population is aging rapidly.
The number of people over 65 is expected to increase from 18% in 1990, to 35% in 2050.
The population of young adults is expected to decline sharply in years to come, coupled with an aging population, will likely lead to labour shortages.
Japan is expected to experience a sharp population decline of almost 40 million residents to 90 million by 2050.
Over 86 million residents are estimated to have middle class spending power.
Over 66 million residents make up the Japanese labour force.
Japan has a high GDP per capita of US$30,000 per person.
Approximately 50% of females are now employed outside of the home.
Japan’s unemployment rate is 4.5%, a decline from over 5% in 2003.
Consumers tend to "eat with their eyes," viewing food as art and are looking for aesthetically pleasing products when shopping.
Eating Habits
• A typical Japanese breakfast includes rice, raw egg, salted salmon and/or fermented soybeans and miso soup.
• The most common dinner foods are meats, fish, vegetables and rice.
Traditional Japanese meals include a large bowl of rice, several side dishes (meat, fish, or vegetables) and a bowl of miso soup.
• Snacking throughout the day is not yet common; although, western influences are increasing snacking habits.
Males are more likely to snack than women.
• Men are more likely to eat outside the home than women.
• Single and working women tend to prefer eating out due to lack of desire to prepare their own meals.
• Rural residents are more conservative, and have not been as affected by outside influences.
Due to the proximity of retail outlets, rural consumers eat most meals at home and make fewer trips to purchase groceries.
• Japanese soft drinks mostly consist of tea drinks, with growing popularity in sugar-free and ready made drink products.
• Consumer confidence in food is tied heavily to trust in government.
• Younger people seem to be adopting a westernized diet, while older adults, especially in rural areas stick to the traditional Japanese diet.
• Obesity rates are an increasing concern in Japan.
While still very low, it is estimated that 3% of the population is considered obese which translates to 4 million people in a region where obesity is usually not of particular concern.
Adoption of westernized eating habits (increases in fat and sugar) are responsible for the rising rate.
In 2003, Japanese households spent an annual average of $8,840 on retail food purchases and $5,146 on food-service purchases.
• Mean personal income is expected to increase by almost 20% and disposable income by 5% in Japan by 2015.
• Disposable income for the majority of men has decreased slightly; however, disposable income for women increased by 22.7% between 1999 and 2003.
• Consumers often purchase foods on a daily basis, searching for the highest quality products at several outlets.
• Local, general and specialty stores account for 39% of food sales, while 34% is sold in supermarkets and 13% in convenience stores.
General merchandise stores are growing in popularity, providing product selections for one stop shopping.
• Teenagers (10-19 years) spend a significant portion of their money on social and leisure activities, including dining out.
Trends
• Consumers with higher disposable incomes are willing to pay for new health products including organic foods, which come at a price premium.
• Western influence coupled with a desire for convenience is increasing demand for fast foods and prepared meals.
Convenience is a driving force in restaurant sector growth.
• Consumers are demanding larger quantities of fresh products.
Tracking devices are used to prove freshness and increase consumer confidence.
• Due to its high protein content, fresh meat consumption is increasing faster than vegetable consumption.
• Sugar, carbohydrate, calorie and fat reduced food product demands are a result of health conscious consumers.
Increased fibre, vitamin and mineral content are also important attributes for consumers.
• Meal replacement product popularity is increasing, with sales expected to grow 13% between 2004 and 2009.
• Alcohol consumption has increased in recent years.
Beer accounts for 55% of the market, followed by Japan’s traditional alcoholic beverage, sake.
• Coffee consumption has increased almost 14% since 1998 due to a significant increase in the number of coffee shops in Japan.
Japan Consumer Profile:
• Importing a total of US$67.4 billion of agri-food products, Japan is the world’s largest market for imported consumer food products.
With only a small portion of Japan suitable for agricultural development, Japan has to import over 60% of their foodstuffs.
Japan has also begun to establish offshore production facilities and invest in food processing ventures, particularly in Southeast Asia and China and even Australia.
These overseas facilities produce products specifically for the wants and needs of the Japanese market.
Consumer oriented food imports were valued at almost US$26 billion in 2004.
Edible seafood imports accounted for almost US$14 billion.
Japan’s self sufficiency rate in these sectors is decreasing, from 45% in 1994 to 40% in 2004, indicating opportunities for exporters specializing in these product categories.
In 2004, Japan’s top sources for consumer oriented agri-food products included the United States, China, Australia, Denmark, and Canada.
Together, these countries accounted for over 50% of Japan’s consumer oriented good imports.

Complete Statistical Summary Available: http://ats.agr.gc.ca/stats/japan_e.pdf
Economy Japan has the second largest economy in the world after the United States, with a GDP of US$4.6 trillion is 2005.
Manufacturing accounts for over 20% of GDP, with electronics and the car industry dominating this sector.
Japan is the world’s largest machine tool manufacturer and one of the world’s most important iron and steel makers.
Although Japan is heavily-dependent on imports for raw materials, fuel and food products, Japan runs a trade surplus.
Japanese firms are key players in the Asian economy and are involved in a number of initiatives to promote greater Asian economic integration.
Japan is not a member of any regional trading bloc; however, it has been promoting bilateral free-trade agreements with a number of countries.
Japan signed its first Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore in 2002 and has continued to establish FTAs with Mexico, Malaysia and Thailand.
Additional FTAs are being negotiated with a number of other countries.
Although, Japan has suffered from recession and deflationary trends since the early 1990s, its economy appears to be recovering.
Japan’s population is aging faster than any other country in the world, placing pressure on the economic system.
The Japanese government has launched broad reforms to privatise state enterprises and deregulate much of its financial system.
Currently, the most important privatisation target is Japan Post, which will be privatized between 2007 and 2017.
Its privatisation will have a large impact on the financial sector because of its enormous life-insurance and postal-savings assets.
Gross Domestic Product (2005) GDP GDP growth GDP/ capita GDP/ capita (PPP) US$4.6 trillion (2005) 2.8% (2006e) 2.5% US$35,787 US$30,615
• In 2005, the agricultural sector contributed about 1% of GDP, industry 25% and services 74%.
Unemployment is quite low at 4.4% in 2005.
Top industries include manufacturing motor vehicles, electronic equipment, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemicals, textiles, and processed foods.
Main imports include petroleum, machinery, food and chemicals.
Main exports include automobiles, electrical machinery, mechanical machinery and industrial goods.
Private consumption, imports and exports are increasing moderately.
Forecast
• Deflationary trends in Japan are expected to end in 2006.
The inflation rate is forecasted at 0.2% in 2006 and 0.7% in 2007.
The population is expected to drop from nearly 128 million in 2006 to 110 million in 2040.
The yen is expected to continue strengthening against the US dollar.
Japanese consumers have more disposable income than in many other countries and look for diverse and high-quality food products.
Quality, and in particular freshness, is of utmost importance to Japanese consumers.
Japanese consumers are also concerned about food safety and traceability, and will pay higher prices for food that is guaranteed safe.
Japanese produced food and nongenetically modified food is popular, due to its "safe" image.
Japan has 12 urban centres with populations exceeding 1 million.
The largest population centres include Tokyo/Yokohama, Osaka and Nagoya.
Rice is a staple food in Japan; however, other carbohydrates such as starchy roots and in particular potatoes are also an important part of the Japanese diet.
Fruit is popular in Japan, but consumption is limited by its high price.
The health-oriented food market is a growing sector in Japan, with an estimated annual value of $14 billion.
Japan’s aging population is particularly health conscious and is driving demand for health food products.
Consumers are demanding a greater variety of health-foods and functional foods, and niche products that target specific health issues are popular.
Increased demand for health-oriented and functional foods, as well as organic foods, is creating new opportunities for Canadian exporters.
Convenience products such as prepared, ready to eat and processed foodstuffs have also been gaining popularity in Japan.
Japanese consumers tend to eat take-out meals and pre-cooked meals more frequently than in the past and processed foods are becoming a way of life for many consumers.
The market for home meal replacements is growing and could provide opportunities for Canadian food suppliers looking to expand their operations in Japan.
The consumption of home meal replacements as well as restaurant meals will likely increase as the number of oneperson households grows.
Consumers also prefer small packages and serving sizes as they often have minimal storage space and families tend to be small.
Japan has one of the largest markets for ready-to-drink products in the world.
Within this market, tea drinks followed by coffee drinks are the most popular.
In comparison to the ready-to-drink market in Canada, carbonated beverages have a relatively low market share (16%) in Japan.
Bottled water is also a growing sector, as Japanese consumers become increasingly concerned about the quality of tap water.
Although the overall demand for alcoholic beverages is declining, the wine market is growing.
Despite the growing popularity of wine, beer remains the most popular alcoholic beverage.
Kirin, Asahi and Sapporo are the main brewers.
The second most popular alcoholic drink is sake, a traditional fermented rice drink.
Opportunities There are significant opportunities for Canadian exporters as the Japanese economy recovers and Japanese consumers adopt a more Westernized diet.
Best prospects for Canadian agri-food exporters include healthful and ready to eat food products.
Furthermore, as the Japanese population ages, consumer products for the elderly have excellent prospects.
Some additional products that may have good growth potential in the Japanese market include:
Competitors The top agri-food and seafood importers to Japan are the United States, China, Australia and Thailand.
These countries supplied more than half of Japanese food imports in 2005.
• Food trade events in Japan can be an important tool for Canadian exporters looking to enter the Japanese market.
For a listing of upcoming events consult: http://atn-riae.agr.ca/events/events_asia-e.htm#Japan The internet may also be an effective way to access the Japanese market.
Internet food sales are growing and are expected to reach $28.5 million in 2006.
This is of particular interest to producers of high-value and specialty goods.
High tariffs are applied to most imported value-added processed foods as well as dairy products, roots and tubers, products of the milling industry and sugar.
The Customs and Tariff Bureau is responsible for administering tariffs.
Tariff quotas are applied to dairy products, rice, wheat, barley, prepared edible fat and starches.
Japan has one of the world’s least restricted liquor regulation laws; however, excise and sales taxes are high and competition is intense.
About 80% of alcoholic beverages consumed are domestic brands.
Japan has mandatory labeling of foods derived from biotechnology.
The Food Sanitation Law and the Genetically Modified Food Labeling Standard Law specify requirements for genetically modified commodities.
In 2003 Japan closed its borders to Canadian beef after BSE was detected.
In 2005, Japan agreed to resume trade in Canadian beef from cattle aged 20 months and younger.
Effective 2005, Japan implemented a notification policy for the importation of animals.
This policy requires that a health certificate be issued by the exporting country certifying that the animals are free from infectious disease.

• Business attire is more formal than in North America.
Men generally wear dark blue suits with white dress shirts in a business setting.
It is considered polite to give and receive business cards using both hands.
Entry permits for tourists are issued for a maximum of 90 days.
Foreign visitors are required to carry their passport at all times while in the country.
Canadian credit cards are widely accepted.
ATMs do not normally accept Canadian debit cards.
Traveler's cheques can be exchanged at major banks and hotels.
Full medical coverage is highly recommended as medical services are usually much more expensive than in Canada.
For more detailed travel information consult the Department of Foreign and International Affairs Travel Report for Japan: http://www.voyage.gc.ca/dest/report-en.asp?country=140000 Agriculture Sector & Policies Japan does not produce sufficient food to meet its needs and imports about 60% of its food requirements.
Only a small portion (13%) of Japan’s total area is suitable for agricultural and Japanese food production continues to decline.
Labor shortages and land-use policies have driven up domestic production costs making imports increasingly competitive.
Japan’s agricultural sector accounts for slightly more than 1% of total GDP and engages about 5% of the population.
It is highly subsidized and is dominated by small farms.
Farms are organized under a large and powerful agricultural cooperative system, which lobbies for high support prices, tariffs on imports and the maintenance of small farms.
Japanese agriculture is centered on the production of rice, livestock, fruits and vegetables.
Rice is Japan’s most significant agricultural commodity, accounting for about one third of gross agricultural income.
Japan has also established offshore production facilities and invested in food processing ventures, particularly in China and Southeast Asia.
These facilities produce products specific to the Japanese market.

Barriers to trade and investment include frequently changing food standards and regulations, as well as the inconsistent application of laws and regulations.
Organizations involved in the import clearance process include the Korea Customs Service (KCS), the Korean Food and Drug Administration (KFDA), the National Quarantine Office, the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Office (NVRQS) and the National Plant Quarantine Service (NPQS).
Agricultural products may experience port delays as they often require clearance from a number of these organizations.
The South Korean communication and transportation infrastructure is welldeveloped.
Distribution is generally efficient, simplified by a population that is concentrated around Seoul.
There are also three main airports in South Korea.
Communication infrastructure is excellent and includes extensive cellular phone and internet services.
South Korea Country Report:
• A free trade agreement is currently being negotiated between South Korea and Canada.
If this agreement is implemented, access to the South Korean market should improve and barriers to trade will be eliminated.
Tariffs vary from product to product.
Tariff rates tend to be higher for products available domestically.
Processed products and bulk products needed by local industries have lower tariffs.
Sanitary and phytosanitary certificates are required for live animals, plants and meat products.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency issues these certificates prior to export to a foreign country.
Food shows provide an excellent chance to explore market opportunities and make contacts with importers, agents, wholesalers, distributors and other members of the food and beverage industry.

In addition, New Zealand maintains very friendly ties with the markets of British Commonwealth, including Canada.
Canada – New Zealand Relations New Zealand and Canada share excellent and longstanding relationship.
Both countries are part of the British Commonwealth and share British colonial roots.
Trade allowances within the Commonwealth provide preference towards CanadianNew Zealand bilateral trade against non-Commonwealth trading partners.

Complete statistical summary available: http://www.ats.agr.gc.ca/stats/newzealand_e.pdf Economy Being one of the smallest but fastest growing economies in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), New Zealand’s economy is highly dependant on the export of agricultural products.
New Zealand has experienced a growth in overall industrialization in the past 20 years, and is heavily dependant on commodity trade to drive its economy.
No longer reliant on "concessionary British market access", New Zealand has developed a free market economy that is resilient, with promises by government to increase expenditures on health, education and pensions as output continues to grow.
In 2005/2006, the budgetary surplus stands at 4.5% of overall GDP.
Although consumer confidence has fallen in the past few years, on the whole, consumers remain reasonably optimistic.
Commodity prices are still close to record highs, which is providing support to farmers' incomes.
Consumer Market The New Zealand consumer market is a small, but prosperous 4 million people.
With busier on-the-go lifestyles, convenience foods and pre-packaged foods are increasingly attractive.
The market itself has seen a drop in fertility rates as well as an overall aging of the population.
Canadian exporters can expect further growth in these areas.
New Zealand’s small population is quite diverse.
As a result of these busier lifestyles, pre-packaged and convenience foods are becoming increasingly attractive.
New Zealand’s older consumers typically have a higher level of disposable income and a product’s perceived quality has become a key purchase decision influencer.
Products and services marketed toward this demographic, such as specialised health foods, will have a higher rate of success than those marketed to the younger demographic with less disposable income.
A smaller, yet significant number will shop once every two weeks, especially those who live in rural areas.
Food is primarily purchased from large supermarket chains.
Urban dwellers have access to a large variety of supermarket chains, while rural shoppers have a somewhat limited choice of supermarkets in their vicinity.
Independent food markets thrive in these regions, as the population base does not have the numbers necessary to support large supermarket chains.
Small shopping trips throughout the week are primarily made by those who shop once every two weeks.
These trips are usually made to purchase such perishables as milk, eggs and bread Between 1998 and 2005, average weekly grocery spending has risen from NZ$113 to NZ$142, an increase of roughly $90 to $115 CDN.
A rise in food expenditure levels can be attributed to the rise in inflation levels.
The level of expenditure on foods prepared outside of the home is highly dependent on income.
The households in the top income brackets spend on
average NZ$92 per week on food prepared outside of the home while households in the lowest income brackets average just NZ$13 per week.
Foods prepared outside of the home (take-away foods and pre prepared grocery meals), along with meat, sweet products, spreads and beverages have made the most increases in weekly food expenditures.
Since 1998 these products have had a 26% overall increase in market share.
The United States and the United Kingdom round out the top three agriculture exporters to New Zealand, with neighbouring Pacific-Asian states also ranking high as they continue to build on their share of the New Zealand food import market.
Canadian exporters also face intense competition from New Zealand's domestic manufacturers, as local food and beverage industries concentrate on improving and diversifying domestic production to increase their share of the food market at home, and in the global market.
Access Issues New Zealand is an open market with relatively low tariffs placed on agricultural imports.
Certain areas are under quarantine in regards to importing certain animal and agricultural products; however, this is the only significant barrier to trade in this country.
New Zealand also plans on phasing out most tariffs by 2010, an initiative due in part to their association with the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Compliance with the New Zealand food standards and labeling regulations is of paramount importance, and Canadian exporters should familiarize themselves with these guidelines, particularly the Joint Food Standards Code New Zealand shares with Australia.
This code sets regulations for food entering both Australia and New Zealand.
These regulations can be found at http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/foodstandardscode. As well, Canadian exporters should team up with a customs broker to ensure conformity to all other regulations in effect.
More information can be found at the New Zealand Customs Service Website at http://www.customs.govt.nz/importers/default.asp. Canadian exporters are encouraged to register with the Virtual Trade Commissioner Service, to gain easy access to Canadian embassies and posts abroad.
Canadian exporters are also encouraged to use the services of Export Development Canada (EDC) and the Department of Foreign Affairs, both of which offer trade information and financial and risk management services to Canadian exporters.
New Zealand Country Report:
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United Nations, UNESCO and the WTO; and as such, all regulations and co-operations within these organizations apply to New Zealand’s trading policies.
In general, materials needed by New Zealand farmers that are not available domestically are not subject to duty upon entry into the country.
Tariff concessions are usually made for goods which are not available to New Zealand manufacturers.
All goods imported to New Zealand are subject to a Goods and Services tax (GST), which currently stands at 12.5%.
Items entering New Zealand such as fruits, plants and seeds must be accompanied by certificates from Canadian authorities ensuring that the items have been inspected and declared free of disease.
• New Zealand business practices are similar to North American business practices.
The passport should be valid for at least three months beyond the date of your expected departure from the country.
Canadians must also be in possession of a return or onward airline ticket, a visa for the next destination, and proof of sufficient funds (NZ$1,000 per person per month).
• Visitor visas are not required; however, if you intend to do business in New Zealand you will require a visa.
Because of fertile geography, agriculture has historically been at the forefront of the New Zealand economy.
This shift is related to an increase in dairy prices and a decrease in sheep and cattle prices.
Further, subsidies for farmers were removed in 1985, and since then, livestock producers/farmers have been subject to a more competitive market where prices fluctuate.
Main dairy regions include Waikato, Taranaki and Southland at the bottom of the South Island.
Beef cattle and sheep farms are stationed primarily in the Far North regions of the country.
An interesting trend on the increase is "hobby

Time constraints and increased awareness about the effects of food consumption have led to a greater demand for health and wellness products in Japan.
Conscious customers with higher disposable incomes are willing to pay for new and healthier products.
In Japan, health and wellness products encompass organic foods, functional and fortified foods, "Better for You" foods, and naturally healthy foods.
Many new products in these areas were introduced in the Japanese market place in recent years.
Fortified and Functional Foods Fortified and functional foods have been categorized into five categories of health foods, namely, general foods, supplements, food with nutrient claims, food for special health uses and food for special usage.
As consumers become increasingly concerned with the amount of vitamin intake their bodies require, they are choosing to eat healthier foods that are enriched with natural vitamins and minerals.
Some fortified and functional foods are carbonated beverages, lactic bacillus beverages, cooking oils, soft drinks and chewing gums.
To meet the increasing demand for fortified and functional foods, several new products have entered the market:
• Functional Sugar-free gum such as Xylitol Plus X Citrus Flavour has been launched by Lotte Co Ltd, which reduces the sugar content in the gum.
• Nagoku Dessert Granola, a limited edition granola, was introduced by Calbee Foods Co Ltd, which contains high levels of fibre.
• Ajinomoto Kenkou Canola E cooking oil was produced by J-Oil Mills Inc and contains 10mg of Vitamin E in every 10g.
• Danone Sunny Breakfast Biscuits created by Shanghai Danone Biscuits Food Co Ltd are fortified with vitamins and minerals.
• Balance Up Maple Genmai Bran, which contains fibre, calcium, iron and ten kinds of vitamins and Cereal Bar 5-koku-iri which contains brown rice, corn, germinated wheat, soy beans and millet, fortified with 250mg of calcium were created by Asahi Food and Health Care.
"Better for You" Foods Obesity is already a major concern for consumers in Japan.
Newly "Better for You" foods have been created to promote and enhance healthier lifestyles.
The following are some new products in the market:
• Morinaga Lactferin 200 Yoghurt was created as an extension of the current brand Morinaga Lactferin Yoghurt by containing less sugar.
• 2b Kiwi and Cranberry fortified yoghurt created by Nestle Snow Co Ltd includes collagen and vitamin C from kiwis and rosehips and vitamin C from cranberries.
• Snow Brand Hokkaido Condensed Milk (Non Fat) was produced by Snow Brand Milk Products Co Ltd and contains condensed milk with reduced calories as well as a fat content that is 15% lower than regular milk.
Naturally Healthy Foods Naturally healthy foods can be accessed in the market under the category of general foods.
Natural foods can offer health benefits.
Consumers of natural foods can limit the amount of sugar, salt and high calorie intake while consuming more calcium and non-lactose foods.
Natural foods include honey, preserves such as chlorella and Korean ginseng, and royal jelly.

The economic pressure created by increasing costs in Japan has led to a growing movement for stricter regulations regarding product legislation and consumer safety.
There have been some legislative developments in Japan in the areas of dietetic food, packaging, and alcoholic beverages.
This report highlights these developments.
Dietetic Foods There is no defined law to regulate the distribution and consumption of diet foods in Japan.
Instead, an approval system has been adopted by the Japanese Health Food and Nutrition Food Association, monitored by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
• Supplements are gaining popularity throughout Japan.
There are no legal restrictions enforced for supplements produced in or imported into Japan.
Supplements are under consideration to be reclassified as "nutrition supplement foods" and distinguished from medicines and foods.
• Foods with Health Claims have been identified by the government to ensure the safety of production.
Sub-categories of this segment are Food with Nutrient Function Claims, and Food for Special Health Use.
• Foods with Nutrient Function Claims supply and complement nutrients.
This category does not require notification from the government and can be manufactured and distributed openly throughout the country.
• Foods for Special Health Use (FOSHU) provide positive effects to maintain and regulate the body.
Government approval is required to assess the safety and efficiency of these types of food.
• Foods for Special Dietary Use improve health and are used by consumers who experience specific health conditions.
Labelling specifications must be approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.
Detailed information must be displayed on the food packaging, which is regulated in the Ministerial Ordinance under the Nutrition Improvement Law.
Packaging Packaged food in Japan is becoming increasingly important.
The industry is concerned for the protection of consumers.
Laws and regulations are being enforced and monitored for clearly marked instructions and information accuracy.
• Recycling and Environmental Laws have been formulated to regulate waste disposal, recyclables, and packaging manufacturers.
Alcoholic Beverages The legislation of alcoholic beverages is monitored by the government in Japan.
• The management of alcoholic advertisements throughout Japan has been allocated through government legislation and self regulation.
The advertisement of alcohol is prohibited around children in locations such as schools and parks.
Restrictions have also been enforced on television during children's programming hours.
• All advertisements must include a government sponsored slogan that is clearly displayed.
• The legal drinking age in Japan is age 20.
Market Information Asia Pacific Food and Health in Japan Food Cultures, Lifestyles, and Resulting Trends June 2006
National statistical offices Contacts:
General Lifestyle Habits Increasingly Japanese are eating healthier in order to maintain a slimmer image.
Despite busy lifestyles, more time is focused on consuming healthier foods and eating less.
Eating Habits Japanese consumers eat three meals a day.
A typical breakfast would include a bowl of rice, a raw egg, a piece of salmon with salt and/or fermented soybeans and miso soup.
Lunch is often eaten outside the home by purchasing prepared foods at restaurants or ready made lunch packages at convenience stores.
It is more common to see Japanese men eating out for lunch than women.
The most common foods during dinner are meat, fish, vegetables and rice.
A traditional Japanese meal is a large bowl of rice with several side dishes such as fish and vegetables, or meat and vegetables with miso soup.
Snacking throughout the day is not common.
However, with Western influences, the consumption of snacks has increased.
It is more common to see males snacking throughout the day than women.
Food Preferences Affluence and Eating Quality Ethnic food:
The Japanese have always preferred to dine inside the home where they have fresher foods such as meat, vegetables and fruit.
As Western influence continues, the Japanese select more Americanized and British foods by dining out at fast food restaurants and purchasing ready made foods.
The consumption of beef has risen in the Japanese diet primarily because of fast food outlets.
Family shopping habits:
Food purchases are the second largest expenditure for a Japanese family.
As fresh foods are significant in their diet, most Japanese purchase foods on a daily basis.
By visiting a variety of food outlets, they purchase the highest quality of food products.
Supermarkets are becoming more prevalent throughout Japan.
Revenue:
The disposable income for the majority of men has decreased because of labour cut backs.
However, disposable income for females has increased by 22.7% between 1999 and 2003.
Both men and women in Japan contribute equally to the household income.
Japanese consumers are sensitive to price.
The mean disposable income is expected to grow by 4.6% between 2000 and 2015, and it is expected that the mean personal income will have grown by 20% by the year 2015.
Geography:
In Japan, food consumption varies by geographical region.
Generally, consumers in urban areas purchase more from supermarkets and food outlets because of availability.
They have access to a variety of foods including meats and fish and therefore shop more frequently.
Western influence has also grown in urban areas.
The opportunity to dine out at restaurants or pubs is more common and can be frequent for those with a busier lifestyle.
Packaged foods can also be purchased to save time on meals.
Rural consumers generally eat at home.
The opportunity to visit supermarkets is reduced to a few times a week because of distance.
Dining out is often reduced because of fewer number of established restaurants nearby.
Resulting Food Trends Although traditions are significant in Japanese culture, there are new trends in food.
Demand is increasing for fresh produce such as fruits and vegetables, meats and fish for the preparation of meals.
Tracking procedures are used to mark freshness and provide confidence for consumers to ensure that they are purchasing healthy products.
Consumers in Japan are demanding that more organic foods be made available in supermarkets.
As a result, there is an increasing effort to import organic foods from outside Asia.
Low calorie foods are also becoming popular.
Regardless of trends the average calories per day being consumed in Japan is 1,200, well below that of Canada and the US.
"Eating out" is increasingly popular as it has become more affordable and less time consuming.
Fast food offers convenience for households who have dual incomes and as lifestyles are becoming faster paced.
Eating out has also become a leisure activity.
Between 1999 and 2003, the following growth trends took place:
• Fast food restaurant sales increased by 14.5%
• Self service cafeteria sales increased by 11.9%
• Street stall sales increased by 7.4%
Population by Age Group
• Infants (Under 1 year):
Fewer children are being born, reducing the birth rate.
In 2005, babies and infants accounted for 2.7% of the population, which is expected to decrease in the future.
The decrease has created a decline in sales of baby products such as baby foods.
• Children (2-9 years):
Food consumption has declined in this segment.
As food and health are essential at this age, consumption has been decreasing.
• Tweenagers (10-14 years):
As a result of the low birth rate during the 1990s, this age segment has also decreased.
However, with the development of advertising and fast food, they spend their money on dining out.
• Teenagers (13-19 years):
Teenagers make up 5.9% of the 2005 population in Japan.
Their money is spent on social and leisure activities such as shopping and dining out.
• Young Adults (15-29 years):
This group is often referred to as the studying age.
They have less cash and will spend the least amount on food.
Those working have higher incomes and increase their food expenditures
• Adults (30-59 years):
This group makes up a large portion of the population.
They generally have the highest disposable income and spend their income on purchasing food.
• Over 60 years:
The majority of this age segment has retired.
Much of their savings are allocated to food purchases.
They have a much more traditional diet.
Drinking Habits
• Alcoholic drinks:
The consumption of alcoholic beverages has increased in Japan.
Japanese consumers often drink alcoholic beverages with co-workers or colleagues.
The development of Western influence has popularized pubs and taverns throughout Japan.
Izakaya outlets are the most common places to consume alcohol.
The preferred alcoholic drink is beer, which accounted for 55% of retail sales in 2003 and was dominated by Lager beer.
Keeping with the Japanese culture, sake is the second most popular alcoholic beverage.
It is prepared from fermented rice, koji, and water.
Unlike European-style wine, sake is stronger with 14% in alcohol content.
• Soft drinks:
Japanese soft drinks differ from Western carbonated soft drinks.
Tea drinks are the most common.
As consumers are becoming more health conscientious, sugar-free ready made tea drinks are becoming increasingly popular.
Carbonate drink sales increased by 1.8% between 1998 and 2003.
• Hot drinks:
Although tea and coffee are both consumed hot and cold, coffee has become the most popular hot drink.
As the number of coffee bars is increasing, sales are growing in Japan, increasing by 13.7% between 1998 and 2003.
Obesity Trends Between 1990 and 2003, obesity rates (of Japanese over 15 years of age) increased from 1.8% to 3.3% of the population.
Although this percentage is low compared to Western countries, obesity in men is increasing mostly in urban areas.
Some of the main causes for the increase attribute to:
• Change in diet
• Lack of exercise due to the reliance on automobiles
• Increased dining in "fast food" establishments
Resulting Health Problems The Japanese believe that the key to longevity is good health care.
Heart disease has been the leading cause of death, increasing from 42.1% in 1990 to 71.2% in 2003.
Other deaths caused by diseases such as chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, diseases of the digestive system decreased over the same period.
Foods Likely to Succeed Under These Growing Trends
• The purchase of fresh foods, especially meats, can aid in the long term health of consumers in Japan.
As the number of food outlets is increasing, there is more opportunity for purchases.
• The "fast food" sector has also been growing at an increasing rate and is expected to continue expanding in the future.
• Coffee bars and shops increased in numbers throughout Japan with the development of Starbucks in 1996 and Italian or American gourmet coffees available.

All forecasts are for the 2004 – 2009 period
Niche Market Presence Biscuits The top selling biscuit company throughout Japan in 2004 was Ezaki Glico Co Ltd.
Their success is related to the top selling chocolate coated biscuits known as Pocky.
Market share declined from 9% in 2003 to 8% in 2004.
However, the decline of Pocky was caused by the unanticipated warm weather in 2004 that affected all biscuit sales.
Baked Goods Yamazaki Bakery Co Ltd is the leading company for the production of baked goods.
The company increased its market share to 18% in 2004, up from 17% in 2003.

The company supplies a wide range of products such as milk, yoghurt and bio drinking yoghurt.
The company has become national in scope, increasing its market share to 15% in 2004 from 14% in 2003.
This increase was caused by the introduction of new products in milk and yoghurt.
With the growing health trend, Meiji Dairy Co Ltd introduced milk that contains less water, 40% more calcium and 30% protein.
In 2005, Meiji Dairy Co Ltd launched a new yoghurt called Tialence, which successfully attracted females with high disposable incomes.

Agri-Food Past, Present & Future Report Australia November 2006
Australia Past Present & Future Report November 2006 Overview Although Australia is located on the opposite side of the world, its similarities to Canada and its market potential continue to bring the countries closer together.
Australia has a rapidly growing population and strong economy.
With about 85% of the country’s population of 20.2 million residing in coastal urban centres, Australia is among the most urbanized populations in the world.
Australia’s relationship with dominant players in the Asia-Pacific region is a key factor in its economic strength and appeal to foreign exporters and investors.
Canadians exporting to Australia will face strict food import standards, but once accepted entry, will find much opportunity.
Canadian exporters of consumer-oriented goods, particularly those exporting pork and food preparations, will continue to achieve the most success in the Australian food industry.
Canada - Australia Relations Canada and Australia have a positive and long-standing relationship that is attributed to many shared qualities: parliamentary traditions, large aboriginal communities, culturally diverse nations, healthy standards of living, as well as continental-sized and geographically dispersed landscapes.
Bilateral visits between Canada and Australia began in 1894 when Canada’s first diplomat, John Short Larke was posted as Trade Commissioner to Sydney.
The most recent visit took place in May 2006 when Australia’s Prime Minister visited Canada.
During the visit, the strong relationship between Canada and Australia was addressed.
Canada and Australia enjoy productive and wide-ranging bilateral relations in areas such as trade, security, defense, immigration, consular affairs, culture, academic and student exchanges and tourism.
Canada Australia Report:
By the end of 2004, Canada was Australia’s 11th largest investor and Australia was Canada’s 14th largest investor.
Canada’s investments in Australia are diverse, focused on food processing, mining and energy, engineering, computer software, and media and communications.
There are over 120 Canadian firms active in Australia, the largest being Placer Dome, Alcan, Nortel and McCain.
• In 2005, Canada’s most important exports to Australia were frozen pork (7.1%), motor engines (5.8%) and iron ore (4.3%).
Agricultural Trade Although Canada and Australia produce similar agricultural commodities, the two countries remain significant trading partners.
In 2005, Australia was Canada's 8th largest agricultural trading partner with bilateral trade exceeding $645.1 million.
Australia was also Canada's 13th largest export market, with exports having exceeded $179.7 million in 2005.
Canadian agri-food, fish and seafood exports to Australia have increased steadily from 2003-2005.
Total exports in 2005 reached $179.7 million, an increase of almost 11% from 2004.
Export opportunities lie in Canadian consumer-oriented goods.
In 2005, these products made up 95% of all agri-food, fish and seafood product exports to Australia.
Successful and Growing Agri-Food Export Products:
• Frozen pork continues to be Canada’s main export to Australia.
In 2005 frozen pork exports totalled $116 million, increasing by 9.8% from the previous year.
Exports of this commodity have steadily increased from 2003.
Blueberries (wild and cultivated, combined) were a high growth export commodity from 2004-2005 and continued to experience success from January-August 2006.
In 2006 (January-August), the market was valued at approximately $1.9 million.
Navy/white pea bean exports have experienced tremendous growth to date in 2006 (January-August totals).
This product is valued at almost $1.2 million and grew roughly 190% from 2005’s full year total.
From 2003-05, navy/white bean exports were relatively insignificant with an average of $270,000.
Consumer-Oriented, Intermediate and Bulk Agri-Food Exports
• Canada’s agri-food exports were comprised mainly of consumer-oriented goods in 2005.
Consumer-oriented goods made up rougly 95% of exports, intermediate goods accounted for 4% while bulk goods contributed very little to exports at 1.2% of the $180 million total.
• In 2005, consumer-oriented exports were valued at $162.5 million and increased 16% from 2004’s total of $140.1 million.
• Canada’s most valuable consumer-oriented exports included: frozen pork (72%), food preparations (9.3%), fresh or chilled pork (2.3%), maple syrup (1.9%), and rye whisky (1.6%).
• Canada’s intermiediate agri-food products for 2005 accounted for approximately 4% of exports and were valued at roughly $6.9 million.
Bovine semen (14.7%), animal feed preparations (12.5%), navy/white pea beans (5.8%), lentils (5.0%), oats (4.4%) and starches (4.1%) were the largest export products.
• Intermediate agri-food exports have dropped since 2003 due to decreased exports of pulses and tallow (fat from beef or mutton).
• Bulk exports contributed the least to total agri-food exports to Australia in 2005, making up only 1.2% of total exports and were valued at almost $2.1 million.

Complete Statistical Summary Available: http://www.ats.agr.gc.ca/stats/australia
Economy Australia has an advanced, Western-style capitalist economy.
The country’s emphases on low inflation as well as its growing ties with strong economies in the Asia-Pacific region are key factors behind the economy’s strength.
Rising output in the domestic economy, robust business and consumer confidence, and rising exports of raw materials and agricultural products are fueling the economy.
Like many key players in the world market, Australia’s advanced market economy is dominated by its services sector (71% of GDP).
Although agriculture and mining make up just 8% of its GDP combined, these sectors contribute to 52% of the country’s exports.
Australia has achieved tremendous economic development and strives to increase its competitiveness as a diversified producer and exporter of value-added manufactured products, services and technologies.
Australia was one of the OECD’s fastest-growing economies throughout the 1990’s.
Despite a slowdown in late 2000, it has been 16 years since Australia experienced a recession.
• Real GDP growth has increased or remained constant from 2001-2005, with exception to 2001-2002 when GDP growth rose from 2.4% to 3.9%.
• From 2006-2008, real GDP growth is expected to average around 3% due to both strengthened domestic and international demand (trade commissioner).
Inflation is expected to rise to 3.5% in 2006.
The AUS dollar is expected to weaken from 2007-09.
Consumer Market Canadian exporters can benefit from Australia’s expanding and diversified population demanding consumer-oriented goods, and may also find opportunity in the country’s highly sophisticated food processing sector.
Australia is known internationally for its highly urbanized, well-educated and affluent population focused on "value for money" products.
Exporters can benefit from a changing consumer market much like Canada’s, with a large baby boomer demographic, an increasingly multicultural population, younger, single person households and women becoming major contributors to the workforce.
In 2005, Australian consumers spent roughly $47 billion or 10.2% of their income on food and non-alcoholic beverages.
Much of this spending was sourced from international markets.
Approximately 85% of the products on the shelves of Australian supermarkets are imported, made from imported ingredients or produced locally by foreign owned companies.
Canadian food exporters can benefit from this lucrative import market by recognizing trends in the food retail sector.
Currently, positive selling points in the Australian retail sector are "clean", "green", "organic" and "natural".
Consumer demand for products including these healthy elements have increased over the last five years and can be partially attributed to various high-profile government policies on the socalled "obesity epidemic" in the country.
This emphasis on health matched with the country’s successful ready-made, convenience foods market which includes popular products such as snack bars, soups and pastas, is increasing consumer demand for convenience foods with healthier, more natural ingredients.
For example, ready-made soups containing natural ingredients are a rising trend in Australia.
Over the 2000-05 period, this market saw a 22.4% growth rate.
Value added products and innovative, attractive packaging are also increasingly important to Australian consumers.
When exporting into the Australian food market, Canadian exporters should consider the current decline of pork consumption (between 2000-05 consumption decreased by 6%).
This is due to its perceived unhealthy qualities, as compared to chicken and beef, which in contrast, increased in consumption by 12.3% and 5.6% between 2000-05, respectively.
Although consumer attitudes are changing, Canada’s frozen pork exports continued to increase from 2004 to 2005 at a rate of about 9.8%.
Pork exporters can also expect greater increases in consumption due to the Australian government’s advertising attempts at promoting the healthy characteristics of pork.
The industry is targeting a 20% increase in per capita consumption of pork by 2007.
A growing number of health-conscious Australians also read food labels with greater care.
Processed food label lists that are too long are perceived as being too artificial for many consumers.
• Australia has a population of 20.5 million people with a growth rate estimated at 0.85% in 2006.
• Over 85% of Australia’s 20.2 million people live in coastal urban centres, most notably Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth.
Over the 1990-2005 period, the number of Australians with higher education increased by almost 100%.
As a whole, most lead comfortable lifestyles.
• The percentage of single-person households rose from 19.4% of the total number of households to almost 26% between 1990-2005.
This percentage is expected to rise to about one third of households by 2015.
• The younger portion of single-person households often has high disposable income.
The food industry in particular has seen a marked demand for singleserve, easy-to-prepare foods to cater to single people working full time.
• The percentage of children and ‘tweenagers’ (age 10-14) in the population is decreasing and will continue to do so.
However, children are important to consumption levels.
Research has shown that Australian children as young as three are already brand-conscious and have opinions about consumer goods.
Areas of Opportunity
• Organic and Natural Products: o This market is growing rapidly.
Australia is a large producer of organic raw products, although it does not have the manufacturing capacity to satisfy demand for the processed segment.
Market prospects are excellent for exporters of organic and natural ingredients. o Younger consumers and particularly parents of young children are driving the organic trend. o According to the Organic Federation of Australia, key wholesalers of organic foods have reported demand growth of 25-30% per year, for the last five years. o Although a growing trend, the average consumer in Australia finds organic food too expensive and not as convenient as other products.
The price premium (almost 20% in 2005) carried on these foods is high.
Cold Beverages: o Fruit/tea drinks:
In 2005, its overall growth by grocery volume was 80%. o Sports and energy drinks:
In 2005, this segment achieved volume growth of 16% and 30%, respectively.
The value of these two sectors was roughly $100 million, a rise of $25 million over the 2004 value. o Bottled water:
In 2005, consumption of bottled water increased 13% in volume terms.
This industry in the beverage sector has received the most innovative product developments in recent years.
Nutritious snacks: o In 2005, Australia’s natural snacks segment had grocery value of roughly $455 million and grew by approximately 8%. o Nutritious snacks are one of the fastest growing categories in Australia’s supermarket industry, with the ‘snack bar’ segment sharing the highest growth. o Nutritious snack bar consumption rose by 30% between 2000-05. o In 2005 alone, this nutritious snack bar category grew over 16% by value and 9% by volume. o Although many Australians seek a healthier diet, between 2000-05, growth of confectionary and sweet and savory snacks rose by 14% and 13%, respectively.
Convenience and Ready Made Foods
• Both time pressures and single living have had an impact on the food market.
Ready-to-prepare meals, convenience foods, and single-serve portions have seen an enormous upsurge in demand over the last decade.
• Fresh foods are increasingly popular in Australia; however, due to the increasingly busy single population, many prefer healthy, fresh food to be ready-made, rather than cooking it from scratch.
Products such as readymade soups containing fresh vegetables and pasta sauces with fresh ingredients have become very popular.
• The fresh pasta & sauce segment grew almost 10% by grocery volume in 2005.
Food Retail Trends
• Australian food manufacturers have been consolidating, which has lead to greater competition by brands for shelf space in supermarkets.
They are both involved in a campaign to acquire smaller independent chains to maintain their dominant market shares.
A recent survey indicated that 72% of people think that expensive restaurants are overpriced.
Restaurants with a casual atmosphere, reasonable prices and simple menus with fresh foods are very popular.
• The restaurant sector is using away-from-home meals to meet consumer needs.
• Alcohol consumption is very high in Australia.
Flavoured alcoholic beverages were the definitive winners in consumption over the 2000-05 period.
These drinks are targeted at young women and marketing and labelling efforts to this group have become increasingly sophisticated.
• From 2000-2005, beer, like coffee, became somewhat of a connoisseur’s field in Australia.
Specialty beers imported from overseas carry a premium price and are seen a sign of status and "coolness".
Canadian beer has not yet made an impact in this market segment.
Competitors For many years, UK and other EU countries dominated the value added import market in Australia due to the large majority of its population being of English and Irish decent.
Over the years, Australia’s increasingly multicultural population has changed Australia’s traditional tastes and broadened the country’s scope to other international import markets.
Greece, Italy, Spain and Southeast Asian countries have become important sources of imported foods for Australian consumers.
Top Canadian agri-food exports face competition from Denmark, Ireland, the United States, New Zealand and Vietnam.
Although Canada is Australia’s top pork exporter, Denmark is a close competitor in this market.
Ireland dominated Canada’s second largest export commodity, food preparations, in 2005 while the United States was Australia’s top supplier of whiskies.
Begun as an informal dialogue group, APEC has since become the primary regional vehicle for promoting open trade and practical economic cooperation.
This agreement came into effect in 1983 and increases the countries bilateral trade relationship in goods and services and allows for close collaboration across quarantine, customs, transport, regulatory and product standards and business law issues.
The ANZCERTA is one of the world’s most open and successful free trade agreements.
Australia also has Free Trade Agreements (FTA) with the following countries: o The United States o Thailand o Singapore o Papua New Guinea Australia is currently negotiating FTAs with the following international competitors: o China o ASEAN-New Zealand (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Singapore, Myanmar), New Zealand o Malaysia
Access Issues Accessing the Australian market has been made easier in recent years with its government active in reducing regulations and improving business infrastructure.
Australia generally has no import quotas and most import duties were phased down to 5% (general rate) in 1996.
Nonetheless, Canadian producers wishing to enter the Australian food industry will face many challenges with its strict food standards, labelling requirements and sanitary and phytosanitary standards.
• General import regulations are laid out by the High Commission of Canada to Australia http://www.infoexport.gc.ca/ Australia and New Zealand have a joint food standards code that applies to both countries.
The Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code outlines standards in product, safety requirements as well as outlines labelling requirements.
A consolidated version of this code can be viewed at:
Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code In 2001, mandatory requirements for labelling genetically modified foods (where introduced DNA or protein is present in the final food), came into effect in Australia.
The requirements are covered in Standard 1.5.2 of the joint Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code.
This new process will take effect early in 2007 when regulations being made under the Quarantine Act 1908.
Once business is going well, volumes may become more reasonable.
• Australian importers dislike bargaining.
Importers are prepared to negotiate a reasonable price but will not "bargain" down a price by 20% or more.
If an unrealistic price is offered by a supplier, the importer is likely to not even consider doing business.
• An increasing number of importers are using overseas buying agents to source the right suppliers.
• Australia’s consumer market demands of innovative and attractive retail packaging and its population is increasingly concerned with environmentallyfriendly containers.
Because of this, importers consider retail packaging an important factor in making business deals.
• Australian retail grocery giants, Woolworths and Coles, are both increasingly independently importing, bypassing more traditional import systems (Gain Guide).
Business Travel Tips Canadians doing business in Australia will benefit from the country’s similar business environment.
English is Australia’s first language and Canadians travelling to Australia will experience similar cultural norms, business practices and customer expectations.
Business etiquette is also a closely shared feature between the countries, with attention to advance planning, promptness and punctuality.
Australians commonly possess a friendly, informal attitude in business, yet are direct in making business deals.
When planning a business trip to Australia, Canadians must remember that the seasons are opposite from their own (i.e. the Australian summer takes place from December to February while winter takes place from June to August).
Like many Canadians, Australians take vacations in the summer.
However, due to seasonal differences between the two countries, Canadians may find it difficult to conduct regular business with Australians between the months of December and February.
Business meetings in Australia commonly take place during lunch or breakfast and it is unusual for meetings to be scheduled over weekends.
The Australian government plans to expand its food industry in the next year with The National Food Industry Strategy (NFIS) in place.
This is a $114 million partnership between the Australian Government and industry that aims to position Australia as a significant player with a sustainable and profitable role in the global food product system by 2007.
Such initiatives include delivering funding programs, improving food standards and Australian food safety and quality systems.
In 2004, agriculture made up 3.6% of Australia’s GDP, with the country’s most abundant agricultural products being wheat, barley, sugarcane, fruits, cattle, sheep and poultry.
Agricultural exports are largely fueling the Australian economy with two-thirds of its agricultural products being exported into the world market.
Australia exports roughly 65% of its farm products and 75% of its fish products.
Beef is currently Australia’s largest value-added agricultural export, with other major exports including wheat, barley, veal, tuna, prawns, lobsters, wine, sugar and wool.
In recent years, Australia has made a strong attempt to diversify its agriculture production.
Australia now exports products ranging from rice to citrus fruits.
Most of Australia’s agricultural commodities are exported to its Asia-Pacific partners (Japan, China and Korea) as well as the United States.
Although Australia’s landscape offers a wide variety of agricultural production, it also suffers from forest fires and severe drought.
Over the last several years, drought has harshly affected the major agricultural regions of eastern and western Australia.
In 2004, more than 60% of Queensland and New South Wales was still affected by drought.
People living in these rural agricultural areas are reaching the inability to sustain themselves as grain and wool prices have fallen.
This has caused widespread depression and family disintegration.
Agronomists warn that the toll of the drought is so severe and the land is so degraded, that it will take much more rainfall than what is optimistically expected to redeem the agricultural situation.
The Rural Policy and Innovation (RPI) program promotes self-reliant, profitable, competitive and sustainable farm businesses and industries.
It achieves this by developing and implementing a range of policies and programs to build the capacity of rural businesses (i.e. drought assistance, research and development, biotechnology, and taxation and regulatory issues) in these areas are reaching the inability to further sustain themselves.
Canada's diplomatic representation in Australia comprises the Canadian High Commission in Canberra, the Canadian Consulate General in Sydney, headed by Consul General L Richard Kohler and two honorary consuls located in Melbourne and Perth.

Agri-Food Past, Present & Future Report Hong Kong SAR, China January 2007
Hong Kong Country Report:
Hong Kong SAR, China Past, Present & Future Report December 2006 Overview Hong Kong, one of the most trade-oriented and open economies in the world, is an extremely valuable market for Canadian agri-food exporters.
The city’s deepwater port, solid infrastructure, strong services sector, and free-market philosophy make Hong Kong an attractive business market for Canadian companies.
Furthermore, Hong Kong’s close relationship with mainland China is increasing the city’s attractiveness to exporters abroad.
With mainland China developing at a rapid pace, Hong Kong is positioned as an evermore important gateway to one of the world’s most lucrative consumer markets.
Therefore, effectively marketing and positioning Canadian goods to Hong Kong buyers will be paramount in securing future business and large market share throughout the mainland Chinese marketplace.
Hong Kong’s unique history has allowed it to reach greater prosperity than that of other Chinese regions.
China resumed control over Hong Kong in 1997 after more than 150 years of British colonial rule, and established its "one country, two systems" policy, whereby Hong Kong became a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the mainland.
Hong Kong maintains a high degree of independence from China, with only its foreign and defence affairs managed by the country.
As a result, Hong Kong has become an economic success that is considered the trade, financial, tourism and services centre of Asia.
Canada – Hong Kong Relations Canada and Hong Kong maintain excellent bilateral relations and enjoy a strengthening business and trade relationship.
Diplomatic relations were established in 1970 and high-ranking official visits are maintained on an annual basis.
Canada and Hong Kong currently share trade, development, educational, and cultural partnerships.
Canada has invested more than $40 billion in Hong Kong since 1989.
Canada and Hong Kong’s trade relationship is the cornerstone of successful longterm relations.
This relationship will prove to be extremely important in further strengthening bilateral trade, particularly in fostering future growth in agricultural and agri-food commerce.
The magnitude of this bilateral relationship is further illustrated below through trade figures:
Canada-Hong Kong Bilateral Trade (2005) Hong Kong Total Trade Exports Imports Trade balance Canada-Hong Kong Trade Exports Imports Trade balance Canada-Hong Kong Ag Trade Exports Imports Trade balance US$592.9 billion US$292.3 billion US$300.6 billion (US$8.3 billion) $1.9 billion $1.4 billion $559.5 million $873.9 million $356.7 million $335.1 million $21.5 million $313.6 million
Top Canadian exports to Hong Kong include nickel (10.9%), raw mink furskins (7.1%), and ginseng roots (4.6%).
Top Canadian imports from Hong Kong include laptop computers (5.1%), printed books, brochures, (4.9%).
Such goods comprised almost all Canadian agri-food exports to Hong Kong at 96% in 2005.
Canada’s agricultural exports to Hong Kong increased by 28% between 2004 and 2005 mainly due to large increases in intermediate and consumer-oriented exports.
Canada currently accounts for 3.6% of Hong Kong’s total agri-food imports and is Hong Kong’s 7th largest import source for such goods.
Canada also sells a considerable amount of fish and seafood to Hong Kong; exports totalled more than $70.4 million in 2005.
Hong Kong Country Report:
• Total agricultural trade represents approximately 18% or $356.7 billion of all trade between Canada and Hong Kong.
Top Canadian exports to Hong Kong in 2005 were raw mink furskins totalling $102 million and representing approximately 30% of total agri-food exports, ginseng roots at $65.8 million or 20% of total exports, and frozen bovine cuts worth over $36.1 million and 11% of exports.
Hides and skins of bovine animals, and whole bovine hides accounted for roughly $23.9 million and $12.7 million respectively, or 7% and 4% of exports.
Major fish and seafood exports to Hong Kong in 2005 included geoduck clams at over $27 million and making up 39% of total exports, molluscs valued at $7.6 million and 10% of total exports, and stimson’s clams totalling more than $5 million or 7% of exports.
Live lobsters and Atlantic salmon accounted for $3.6 million and $3.5 million respectively, or 5% each of exports.
2005 bulk exports to Hong Kong totalled $11.7 million, decreasing by $2.4 million from 2004, while intermediate exports totalled $243.5 million and showed about 15% growth from 2004.
Consumer oriented exports were valued at $79.9 million in 2005, an impressive $45 million or 129% jump from 2004.
Top Canadian imports from Hong Kong in 2005 were waters and non-alcoholic beverages valued at over $2.6 million and making up almost 12% of all agrifood imports, doughs valued at over $2 million or 9% of total imports, and prepared pastas totalling more than $1.9 million or 9% of such goods.
Other major Canadian agri-food imports included herbs, and mixed condiments and seasonings, each worth over $1 million or roughly 5% of total imports.
Economy Hong Kong holds the freest and most dynamic economy worldwide.
The region enjoys a number of economic strengths including large public and private sector wealth due to years of rapid growth, excellent infrastructure, a sound banking and legal system, little public debt, and strictly enforced anti-corruption laws.
Although Hong Kong experienced two recessions over the past decade (i.e. 1997-98 Asian financial crisis and 2001-02 global downturn), economic growth has rebounded since 2003 with increases in exports, inbound tourism, and consumer spending benefiting the territory.
The state is planning to further promote Hong Kong as a world-class trans-shipment point while strengthening its financial services, logistics, and tourism and service offerings to international exporters.
In order to maintain its market competitiveness and hold its position as a primary gateway to China, Hong Kong has increased its business ties to the mainland’s Pearl Rive Delta, an expanding trade hub for China.
Such efforts include the recent conclusion of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) between Hong Kong and China, which will impose zero duties on goods originating from Hong Kong and give the region preferential access to 27 Chinese service sectors.
Hong Kong is also participating with Macau and nine Chinese provinces in a pan-Pearl River Delta trade block which plans to lower access issues, regulate policies and improve infrastructure.
Foreign investment levels totalled US$35.9 billion in 2005, greater than the US$33.9 billion FDI total of the next three largest Asian recipients combined (i.e. Singapore, South Korea and India).
Hong Kong is regarded as the second leading Asian destination for FDI after mainland China, attracting over 22% of all foreign investments to the region.
Gross Domestic Product (2005) GDP GDP growth GDP/capita GDP/capita (PPP) US$177.7 billion (2005) 7.3% (2006) 6.0% US$25,759 US$33,144
two-thirds of its GDP.
It is expected to rise to 2.3% in 2006 and 2.5% in 2007.
• Hong Kong remains largely privatized, with the private sector accounting for
Forecasted economic trends:
• GDP growth reached 7.3% in 2005, fuelled by exports, inbound tourism and an increase in consumer spending.
GDP is expected to slow to 5.5% in 2007, from 6.0% in 2006.
• Hong Kong’s unemployment rate is expected to average 4.8% in 2006, and decrease slightly to 4.4% in 2007 through 2008.
Consumer Market There are a number of trends and changes in Hong Kong’s consumer market that are currently impacting exporters’ approaches to entering the marketplace.
Hong Kong’s residents are becoming increasingly busier, often working more than 48-hour, 5-day work weeks and are therefore fuelling growth in the foodservice, packaged, processed, and convenience food sectors.
With a number of food safety and health scares in Asia over the past several years, consumers have become more health conscious and aware of the benefits associated with healthy eating and lifestyles.
Hong Kong’s residents are extremely sensitive to food safety issues and generally prefer fresh food products over pre-packaged and processed foods.
Therefore, major opportunities for Canadian agri-food exporters may include offering high-quality, organic, natural and healthy convenience foods.
Hong Kong residents are also very concerned with their overall appearance and wellbeing.
Many consumers try to improve their health or image by turning to health foods for general wellness, disease prevention and nutritional benefits.
Organic foods are also in greater demand since food crises plagued the state, and genetically modified foods have come under criticism from consumers.
Vitamin and mineral supplements, ginseng and dietary foods should present opportunities for Canadian exporters in the future.
Healthier packaged and readyto-eat foods, such as breakfast cereals, biscuits, yogurt, and soup have become increasingly popular.
Consumer expenditure totalled $102.2 billion in 2005, and is expected to rise approximately 29% to reach $131.5 billion by 2015.
Overall spending on less nutritious food and beverages seems to be decreasing as consumers become more health conscious, with healthier food options making up the bulk of such goods being purchased.
A decrease in the consumption of chocolate, pastries, canned or preserved meat and vegetables, and butter in recent years exemplifies this trend.
Specific agri-food products that hold strong opportunities in the Hong Kong marketplace include instant and canned soup and noodles, plain noodles and dried pasta; frozen desserts, ready-meals, bakery products and processed fish and seafood products; and flavoured alcoholic beverages and cider (perry).
Breakfast cereals; ready-to-drink coffee; spreadable fats and oils; yogurt, cheese and milk; sauces, dressings and condiments; chips, nuts and biscuits; and canned or preserved fish and seafood are also expected to show considerable growth.
• Approximately 13% of consumer expenditure was allocated to the purchase of food and non-alcoholic beverages in 2005.
• In 2005, consumers spent $12.8 billion on food and non-alcoholic beverages.
This value is expected to increase by 43% to reach $18.3 billion by 2015.
• Dining outside of the home is extremely popular in Hong Kong, as the state is regarded as a "food paradise" offering a wide selection of cuisines from around the world.
• Due to mainland China’s lower standard of living, more and more Hong Kong natives are travelling onshore to purchase their groceries at cheaper prices.
In turn, this has slightly affected packaged and processed food sales in Hong
This growth is constant despite continuing cases of Avian Influenza throughout certain parts of Asia.
The price of poultry is presumed to appeal more to the majority of consumers than those of other red and white meats.
• Eggs are also popular in Hong Kong with approximately 150 units per capita consumed in 2003, a 12% increase over 1998 levels.
• With a push for healthier foods, consumption of vegetables has greatly increased in recent years.
Between 1998 and 2003, per capita consumption of green vegetables rose by almost 13% to reach 140 lb. per capita, and the popularity of tomatoes grew 22% to 47 lb. per capita.
• Non-citrus fruit remain the most consumed fresh foods in Hong Kong at 184 lb. per capita in 2003.
• Consumption of soft drinks increased by 16% between 1998 and 2003, with the majority of growth in ready-to-drink (RTD) tea and coffee products.
The two categories saw 31% and 33% growth respectively, or 24.3 L per capita and 1.5 L per capita consumption over the five-year period.
Growth in Asian specialty drinks followed at 22% and 16 L per capita, fruit and vegetable juice at 16% and 13.9 L per capita, and bottled water with an 18% increase and 21.2 L per capita consumption.
This trend is directly influenced by a desire for healthier eating among Hong Kong consumers.
• Overall alcoholic beverage consumption has declined in recent years, mainly due to less consumption by older drinkers because of the rising price of alcohol and growing health concerns.
Younger consumers, however, have increased their alcoholic consumption, with cider, wine and champagne showing high growth.
Stout, lager, rum, tequila and hard liquor are generally perceived to be drinks of the older generation.
• Key opportunities within Hong Kong’s food and beverage market include convenience and processed food products, health foods and snacks, organic foods, and fish and seafood.
• Retail food sales reached $6 million or 27% of total consumer retail spending in 2003.
• Hong Kong’s residents typically shop once or twice a week for groceries due to their busy lifestyles.
Open markets are still common for fresh food purchases; however, with the emergence of many large supermarkets and
convenience stores, increasingly large amounts of consumers, especially younger shoppers, are turning to such modern formats to purchase groceries.
This has further increased the popularity of modern retail over outdoor markets, which are typically only open in the morning.
However, shoppers are more selective and price conscious due to poor economic conditions over the past few years.
As Chinese become increasingly busier and health conscious, they are dining more at restaurants and purchasing larger amounts of ready-to-eat, takeaway and fast foods.
Such formats allow for convenience and offer consumers many healthy food options.
Although, the SARS epidemic had decreased regular spending on eating out in 2003, expenditure in this area has rebounded in recent years.
Full-service restaurants account for 75% of the $8.4 billion (or 66% of consumer food expenditure) annually spent by consumers on food for consumption outside of the home.
Competitors As a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), Hong Kong relies heavily on its many Asia-Pacific neighbours as import sources, making the territory a more challenging market for Canadian products and companies to penetrate.
Hong Kong’s principal agri-food import sources, China (26.7%), United States (13.2%), Brazil (5.7%), Denmark (5%) and Thailand (4.8%), represent Canada’s top competition in the Hong Kong export market.
Furthermore, Hong Kong’s CEPA with China also influences the number of exports that enter the state, as Hong Kong acts as a major transhipment point for exports destined for China.
In fact, almost 50% of all food products imported into Hong Kong are in turn shipped to Guangdong, China, a key entry-point for Chinese imports.
Access Issues Hong Kong remains a destination of constant trade and investment interest for foreign investors, and holds strong potential for Canadian companies wanting to penetrate the Chinese and/or Asian market.
To facilitate successful market entry, Canadian exporters are encouraged to develop market entry strategies that include working with local importers and distributors to develop a presence, gain valuable market advice, and best position products to meet local tastes, laws and pricing.
• Canadian exporters must ensure that their Hong Kong counterparts declare their imports to the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department within 14 days of receiving goods.
• Hong Kong collects a trade declaration tax of HK$2.00 (i.e. $0.29) for shipments valued under HK$4,000 (i.e. $582) and an extra HK$0.50 (i.e. $0.07) for each additional value of $1000 (i.e. $145) on all imports except transhipments.
• Import licences, health certificates and other documents may be required for agri-food exports.
Canadian exporters should consult their importer on the necessary paperwork prior to shipment.
• Due to health and safety reasons, game, meat, poultry, milk, frozen confectionary, fish and seafood products, and live plants and animals require import permits and/or health certificates.
• For more detailed information on customs procedures, documentation, tariffs and labelling requirements consult Hong Kong’s Trade and Industry Department website www.tid.gov.hk. Business Travel Tips Hong Kong business customs are similar to those in North America; however a good understanding of the differences is important for successful market entry.
• Accept and offer business cards with both hands, and make sure to study them for a few seconds before putting them carefully away.
It is recommended that Canadians offer bilingual, English-Cantonese business cards to their counterparts.
• Offering small gifts to Chinese business people is welcomed although not necessary.
Never give a clock, handkerchief, umbrella or white flowers, as these items signify tears and/or death.
Fruit and items that are not available in Hong Kong are best, e.g. Canadian coins, stamps, coffee table books.
Gifts should always be politely accepted, although never opened in front of the giver.
• English and Cantonese are the official languages in Hong Kong.
Cantonese is widely spoken although most business can be conducted in English.
• Chinese may ask their business counterparts personal questions regarding their age, marital and family status, as this is not considered impolite in Hong Kong.
• Normal business hours run from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, and 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Saturday.
Punctuality is very important in Hong Kong.
The state’s agricultural industry produced over $187 million of goods in 2004.
Livestock accounted for approximately 48% of this value, and crops and poultry each comprised 26%.
Arable land accounts for approximately 5% of total agricultural land, and permanent crops make up 1% of this land.
There are 20 sq. km of irrigated land in Hong Kong.
With only 12 organic farms in Hong Kong, organic food prices remain quite high in comparison to those of imported goods.
Therefore, Hong Kong primarily relies on imports to satisfy domestic demand for natural foods as many consumers are still price sensitive.

Agri-Food Past, Present & Future Report Afghanistan February 2007
Afghanistan Country Report:
Afghanistan Past Present & Future Report February 2007 Overview For 3,000 years, Afghanistan has been at the junction of trade routes between Central, South and West Asia, as well as serving as a key gateway between Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
Afghanistan is bordered by Pakistan to the south and east, Iran to the west and Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan to the north.
In the extreme northeast, Afghanistan has a common border with China.
Afghanistan’s agricultural sector has historically been important to both its population and various export markets.
While the sector and its support infrastructure have been severely damaged over the last 30 years, it has demonstrated the ability to be both self-sufficient and profitable.
**All economic information and trade data included in this report has been presented without the inclusion of the poppy/opium/heroin trade, unless otherwise stated.
Canada - Afghanistan Relations Canada established diplomatic relations with Afghanistan in 1968, but relations were ended ten years later as a result of the Soviet invasion.
After the Soviet withdrawal, Canada did not renew relations until 2002.
Afghanistan reopened its embassy in Canada in 2002, while Canada’s embassy in Afghanistan reopened in 2003.
Canada’s current relations with Afghanistan are framed by its military efforts and development projects, aimed at bringing peace, security and economic rejuvination to the country.
Both types of participation have ensured that Canada is deeply invested in the future of Afghanistan.
• Since 2002, Afghanistan has been the single largest recipient of Canadian bilateral aid.
To-date, Canada has invested $600 million in the reconstruction and development of Afghanistan, and by 2011 Canada will have invested $1 billion in total in development efforts.
Canada is one of the top five bilateral donors for reconstruction and development in Afghanistan.
Canada’s funding, overseen by CIDA, is delivered through trusted and wellmanaged partner organizations including the World Bank, UN organizations, as well as reputable international and Canadian non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
CIDA’s aim is to help Afghans help themselves and to strengthen the presence of the national government across the country.
Support focuses on Afghan national programs that ensure local ownership, accountability and community-based engagement.
CIDA addresses the basic human needs of Afghans and supports projects that:
Kandahar Many of Canada’s aid efforts are focused on the province of Kandahar through the Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT).
Canada assumed responsibility for the Kandahar PRT in August 2005.
24 PRTs throughout Afghanistan help the democratically-elected government extend the authority and ability to govern, rebuild the nation and provide services to its citizens.
Based in Kandahar City in the southern province of Kandahar, the Canadian PRT is located in the former heartland of the repressive Taliban regime, which previously controlled much of Afghanistan.
Kandahar is arguably the most targeted province for insurgent activities and represents the greatest need for support.
The most important achievements will be those which bring about long-term sustainable benefits to the Afghan population.
In addition, immediate-need, "quick impact" projects are also being carried out across the province.
Some examples of completed or ongoing projects in Kandahar Province funded by the NSP include:
Irrigation canals Dam diversions Drainage initiatives Water intake (for irrigation) Wells Aqueducts (for channelling water) Rural road rehabilitation (for market access) Water reservoirs Water supply distribution networks
Canadian Agricultural-Specific Development Canada has implemented a community renewal project in Northeast Afghanistan through the Aga Khan Foundation Canada’s (AKFC) Community Renewal Program, providing alternative livelihood options in the context of concerted anti-narcotics efforts.
Most of these efforts have been related to agricultural development, including:
Livestock development centres Animal vaccination Livestock technologies training Rangeland rehabilitation and the establishment of forestry nurseries Horticulture nurseries, trial farms and farmer schools
In 2005, Canada dominated trade with Afghanistan, maintaining a positive trade balance of $18.6 million.
Canada’s exports have increased annually since 2001, climbing from $167,000 in 2001 to $1.8 million in 2002, roughly $9 million in 2003 and 2004, and then doubling to reach $19 million in 2005.
• Miscellenious aritcles
• Machinery, mechanical and electircal products
• Fats, oils & wax products
• Mineral products
• Base metal products
Canada’s most valuable imports from Afghanistan include:
• Textile products
• Machinery, mechanical and electrical products
• Specialized industrial products
• Paper products
• Precious metals/stones
Since 1999, Canada’s agricultural exports to Afghanistan have generally been dominated by a single product annually (with the exception of 2003 and 2005).
• 1999 Hard spring wheat flour - 100%.
Such commodities include chicken and capon cuts and edible offal, wheat nes, soya-bean oil, canola oil, prepared foods (swelled or roasted cereals), food preparations nes, and frozen swine cuts.
In 2006, Canada’s agricultural imports from Afghanistan were almost entirely comprised of wine (95% of imports), and cheese (4% of imports).
Since 1999, the following items have been imported from Afghanistan with some frequency: wine, dried grapes and pharmaceutical plants.
Economy The Afghan economy is dominated by small-farm agriculture.
With a lack of strong central governance the reported national economy represents only a fraction of actual economic activity.
Currently, as much as 80-90% of economic activity remains informal.
Before the collapse of manufacturing, the sector was predominately focused on processing agricultural products.
Production has since dropped to less than 10% of the country’s 1980 production levels.
Current Economic Conditions Major impediments to Afghan economic growth include intermittent electrical power which is only focused around major urban areas, a weak and mainly inaccessible telephone network, as well as an unstable and dangerous transportation infrastructure.
• GDP growth was still healthy but fell to 8.7% in 2006, restricted by drought.
Since 2001 Afghanistan’s per capita GDP has doubled to reach US$354 or US$1,440 PPP.
Major economic centres include Kabul, Kandahar, Herat, Jalalabad and Mazar-e-Sharif.
Economic development and activity varies by region, and despite nationwide poverty, regional economic disparity is viewed as a problem and impediment to growth.
The 2005/06 trade deficit was valued at US$2.6 billion.
Carpets are currently one of the country’s most important export products.
International pledges, made by more than 60 countries and international financial institutions, for reconstruction in March 2004 reached US$8.9 billion for 2004-09.
Economic Forecast 2007- 2008 As an agriculture-based economy, most recent GDP performances and growth forecasts are dependant on favorable weather conditions.
• A favourable growing season in 2007and key irrigation reconstruction projects should increase agricultural productivity.
GDP growth is expected to exceed 12% in 2007 and then settle at 10% in the foreseeable future.
Afghanistan’s mining sector may become an area of future growth; however much foreign investment interest is still needed for the industry to see considerable expansion.
To date, risk assessments of the mining sector have limited investment.
It is widely believed that with expanded security and improved transport infrastructure this sector will be one of the country’s leading earners in the future.
• International pledges, made by more than 60 countries and international financial institutions, for reconstruction in March 2004 reached US$8.9 billion for 2004-09.
2007 international donors and agencies have turned their focus toward developmental goals.
The Afghanistan National Developmental Strategy (ANDS) is a plan for medium-term development that will replace the Interim Afghanistan National Developmental Strategy (I-ANDS) which focused on provision of basic services, such as electricity and education.
Trade Historically, Afghanistan has relied on traditional trade routes and longterm regional trade partners for its import suppliers and export markets.
Outside of its region, the country has been renowned internationally for select products such as rugs/carpets and certain agricultural products (e.g. pistachios, raisins and pomegranates).
Legal trade during the 1990s was dominated by the re-export of products to Pakistan and other neighbouring countries.
Many of these goods originally entered duty-free from Pakistan under the Pakistan-Afghanistan Trade and Transit Agreement.
When Pakistan clamped down on the types of goods permitted duty-free transit in 2000, transporting of the goods through Iran and the Gulf increased significantly.
More recently, trade with NATO countries participating in Afghan operations has supplimented traditonal trade partners.
• In 2005 exports were valued at US$471 million and were comprised of fruits and nuts, hand-woven carpets, wool, cotton, hides and pelts, and precious and semi-precious gems.
Afghanistan’s largest export markets in 2005 were the United States 26%, India 21%, Pakistan 20% and Finland 4%.
Afghanistan had a trade deficit of over US$3.4 billion in 2005.
In 2005, imports were valued at US$3.87 billion and were comprised of capital goods, agricultural inputs, rice, wheat, textiles, and petroleum products (e.g. fuel and cooking oil).
While agricultural products still dominate exports, they have become an increasingly large component of total imports.
In 2005, agricultural products made up between 25% and 30% of the country’s total imports.
Agricultural products accounted for about 53% of Afghanistan's exports in 2001.
Nuts and fruit, including pistachios, almonds, grapes, melons, apricots, cherries, figs, mulberries, and pomegranates are among Afghanistan’s most important exports.
Key Afghan agricultural products maintain a very high international image, particularly in India, and building on this image will be a key to recreating the once strong export sector.
Apart from development goals, it appears that Afghanistan and its region/traditional export markets are seeking to put in place the framework for a return to normalcy as soon as Afghanistan regains its supply capabilities.
• Afghanistan has signed bilateral Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreements with Russia and Turkey.
Afghanistan has also signed a bilateral Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments Agreement with Turkey, and a bilateral Preferential Trade Agreement with India.
Afghanistan is a member of the following trade organizations:
• Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
Afghanistan receives special access to several Western markets based on its status as a leastdeveloped country.
• Duty free and quota free access to Canada
• Generalized Preferences Treatment with Japan
Competition Domestic competition for quality Western goods is limited and imports will dominate this market for some time to come.
Competition for general consumer goods comes primarily for cheap, low-quality goods from Iran and Pakistan.
These products enter the country easily and are sold through sales and distribution networks that would be near impossible for an outsider to access.
• German products have a long history in the market and continue to succeed.
Germany’s relationship with Afghanistan predates the Russian invasion.
Population Three decades of conflict and natural disasters led to millions of Afghans fleeing to neighbouring Iran and Pakistan and a million more internally-displaced within Afghanistan.
Since 2002, between 2 and 3.5 million Afghan refugees have returned to their country and over 400,000 internally displaced people have returned to their home towns and villages.
It is estimated that as many as 3 million Afghan refugees currently remain in Pakistan and Iran.
Current population figures for Afghanistan vary greatly.
A 2006 Asia Development Bank estimate states the population is roughly 24 million while the CIA World Fact Book states the total is closer to 31 million.
There are estimates from various sources which mirror or fall between these two values.
Approximations have obviously been affected by a number of factors, such as a thirty-year gap in solid national governance for statistics purposes, conflict, deaths, refugees (both fleeing and returning) and a largely rural population, including nomads, which are difficult to account for.
Generally, municipal figures are considered more accurate.
Afghanistan has 18,000 communities of various sizes.
Afghanistan is an Islamic country.
80% of the population is Sunni, while the remainder of the population is predominately Shi'a.
Islamic religious tradition and codes, together with traditional tribal and ethnic practices, have an important role in personal conduct and dispute settlement.
Afghan society is largely based on kinship groups, which follow traditional customs and religious practices, though somewhat less so in urban areas.
• The work force is estimated at 15 million.
Unemployment is estimated at 40%.
50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Most rural inhabitants are farmers or farm labourers.
Essentially 80% of the Afghan population depends on the agriculture sector for its livelihood.
The average age of Afghan farmers is roughly 45 years.
Non-farmers face very low income potential.
Even skilled professionals find only low pay available.
Police are reportedly being paid US$70 a month, while it has been reported that doctors in some areas can receive as little as US$50.
When compared to the US$400 Taliban fighters reportedly receive for their efforts, the reason for the continuing popularity of the insurgents in some areas is obvious.
Consumers Much of the population continues to suffer from shortages of housing, clean water, electricity, medical care and employment.
It will probably take the remainder of the decade and continuing donor aid and attention to significantly raise Afghanistan's living standards from its current status, among the lowest in the world.
Overall literacy rates are low at 50%, while that of males and females is estimated at 50% and 20% respectively.
However, since 2001 aid and development projects have targeted this issue, and 235 schools in Kandahar now in operation.
Rural consumption of meat, vegetables and fruit is limited.
Afghans have a cereal-heavy diet.
Retail A return to normalcy in traditional Afghan markets has been seen by many as one of the true positive developments since 2001.
Retail trade in Afghanistan is unlike its Western counterparts, but all indications point to the fact that an active central market in a city, town or village is an excellent economic indicator and speaks to a heightened sense of security amongst local consumers.
• Formal distribution and sales channels are not well developed.
Most commerce is limited to small store fronts, urban markets and road side trading.
Agriculture Sector & Policies Overview Agriculture continues to be the backbone of the Afghan economy.
While arable land accounts for only 12% of the available land area, the sector was able to be almost entirely self– sufficient and a net exporter of many high-value commodities.
Over the last three decades, cultivated land area has declined by half to just 6% of the country because of population dislocation, land mines, drought and damage to centuries-old irrigation infrastructure.
• Agriculture currently employs 80% of the population and contributes to roughly 40% to 50% of the country’s GDP.
Prior to decades of conflict, Afghanistan had a largely self-sufficient and export capable agriculture sector.
The sector produced roughly 95% of its wheat and rye requirements, and produced surpluses of rice, potatoes, pulses, nuts and seeds.
Horticultural crops (specifically pistachios, citrus fruits, figs, dates and almonds) once accounted for between 30% and 50% of the country’s export earnings.
However, current agricultural production is a fraction of its potential.
A sector that was traditionally 80% self-sufficient has been reduced to 60%.
In some regions, agricultural production had all but ceased due to destruction caused by the war and the migration of Afghans out of those areas.
Land mines and a lack of irrigation have taken thousands of hectares of agricultural land out of production.
Apart from conflict-related issues, the sector has traditionally been constrained by an almost total dependence on erratic winter snows and spring rains for water.
Drought is always a concern.
Irrigation was primitive before the series of conflicts took place, and now it is essentially in ruins.
The sector has never modernized or implemented modern techniques, and as a result, has very little experience with machines, chemical fertilizers or pesticides.
Current issues facing the sector include limited natural fresh water resources, soil degradation, and overgrazing.
Despite irrigation’s positive impact, the dated technology operates at an estimated 25% efficiency.
Droughts are a regular occurrence and typically affect the sector through mild droughts every two to three years and severe droughts every 30 years.
Wheat currently makes up 80% of all grain production.
In the years directly following NATO involvement in the country, wheat production has increased considerably.
In 2002, the wheat crop grew by almost 70% over the level achieved in 2001.
The variety of the country's crops corresponds to its topography.
• The areas around Kandahar, Herat, and the broad Kabul plain yield a variety of fruit.
The northern regions from Takhar to Badghis and Herat and Helmand provinces produce cotton.
Corn is grown extensively in Paktia and Nangarhar provinces.
Many farms are still listed as little more than subsistence level, and as such too small to positively impact domestic needs.
While individual debt is under $500 per debtor, interest rates can be as high as 50%, and $500 is roughly a years wage for many Afghans.
Planning/Development The immediate plan for the sector involves a number of key issues which have been supported by and contributed to by the world’s leading agricultural organizations.
Through detailed actions which involve a sector-by-sector plan engaging communities, government and the private sector, the Afghan government envisions a sector that can:
Poppies Afghanistan is currently the world’s largest producer of opium.
The country’s opium GDP is estimated at 27% of the total economy and 36% of illicit GDP.
Poppy production is centred in two provinces in the south where insurgents are at their strongest.
Expanding poppy cultivation and a growing opium trade generate roughly US$3 billion in illicit economic activity and looms as one of Kabul's most serious policy concerns.
Afghanistan’s President calls the opium trade his country’s "worst enemy".
Cultivation dropped 48% in 2005; but this was due to weather, not success shifting agricultural producers away from poppy production.
Better weather and lack of widespread disease returned opium yields to normal levels in 2006 and the opium harvest up 49% over 2005.
In effect, when combined with aid dollars, opium is putting too much money into the economy.
Poppy farmers are generally deeply indebted to regional war lords, and with minimal security in certain areas most farmers have no choice but to grow poppies to pay back their debts.
It must also be considered that the power of regional warlords may make the choice to stop producing poppies difficult.
These are all key factors in the minimal success to-date in ending/reducing poppy production.
It is interesting to note that even the repressive Taliban regime gave up on its efforts to ban the production of opium because of the near impossibility/unpopularity of the initiative.
Regardless of the moral/social issues, most experts believe that destroying the opium economy would have a devastating impact unless it was preceded or accompanied by decades of development.
So many people are reliant on funds from poppies that stopping the practice dead would leave thousands if not millions without income.
Agri-Food Past, Present & Future Report Taiwan February 2007
February 2007
Taiwan Past Present & Future Report February 2007 Overview Taiwan has the second highest population density in the world with 22.7 million people or 630 persons per square km.
Taiwan boosts a modern retail sector, with a particularly high density of convenience stores.
Popular items in Taiwan’s food retail outlets are ready-made convenience products and snack foods, with an increasing demand for healthy options in these categories.
Access to Taiwan has greatly improved since its 2002 World Trade Organization (WTO) accession and reduction in tariff and non-tariff trade barriers.
Canadian exporters will continue to experience growing opportunity within the Taiwanese market due to its growing dependence on agriculture and agri-food imports and interest in North American food and beverage products.
According to Taiwan’s Department of Investment Services, 2006 was a strong year for Taiwanese trade, as total trade volume experienced record growth and its trade surplus reached the third-highest level ever.
Trade volume totalled roughly US$420 billion and is expected to increase by 10% in 2007.
Taiwan’s increased trade activity can be mostly attributed to its booming electronics industry.
The Taiwanese government is taking major actions to further improve the country’s economy.
Canada-Taiwan Relations Canada and Taiwan have a pleasant relationship based on long-standing economic and cultural ties, and share similar democratic values.
Canada has benefited from a closer relationship with Taiwan since its accession to the WTO.
Taiwan and Canada are also APEC members, although the island’s membership with various other multilateral and bilateral initiatives is limited due to its diplomatic isolation.
Agricultural Trade Taiwan holds an agricultural trade deficit as large volumes of imports are needed to supplement its relatively small agricultural sector.
In 2005, Taiwan imported $9.6 billion of agri-food and seafood products, while exporting roughly $3.1 billion.
Top products imported into Taiwan are typically cereals, oilseeds, tobacco, and meat products.
Canadian intermediate goods such as bovine hides, canola oil and colza oil make up the majority of exports to Taiwan.
In 2006, this commodity category (excluding fish and seafood products) was valued at $101.2 million, or roughly 60% of all Canadian agri-food exports to Taiwan.
In 2006, Canada’s imports from Taiwan totalled $55.5 million, making Taiwan Canada’s 39th most important supplier.
This commodity emerged as Canada’s fourth most important agrifood export to Taiwan in 2006, with a value of almost $16 million.
Canada`s third most important agri-food export to Taiwan, canola oil, was valued at $16.6 million, a 38% decrease from its 2005 value of $26.8 million.
However, 2005 was an exceptionally successful year for canola oil in the Taiwanese export market.
The 2004 value for this commodity only accounted for $6.9 million.
Canada Taiwan Report:
While frozen swine was one of Canada`s top export commodities to Taiwan in 2006, it suffered a major decline in sales from the previous year.
Canada’s fish and seafood exports represented $27.8 million or almost 14% of total agri-food, fish and seafood exports to Taiwan in 2006.
Products are mainly represented by Atlantic salmon ($9.8 million), frozen capelin ($5.6 million) and Greenland halibut ($3.1 million).
Canada’s Top 5 Agricultural and Seafood Exports to Taiwan (2006) Bovine hides, whole, fresh or wet-salted Bovine hides, butts and bends Canola, colza oil Food preparations, nes Swine, edible offal, frozen nes $46.9 million $18.0 million $16.6 million $16.0 million $9.8 million
Today Taiwan has a strong economy that is undergoing positive developments through its "Challenge 2008 National Development Plan".
The plan allows Taiwan to succeed as a more export-driven economy, with infrastructure improvements benefiting those importing to the island.
The "Challenge 2008 National Development Plan" is also largely focused on making Taiwan a full forced e-economy.
This plan also includes initiatives to double the number of tourists over the next five years.
Taiwan’s economy benefits from strong global demand for its highly-developed electronics and computer-related sector.
In recent years, the island has become an increasingly important producer of semiconductors and liquid crystal display (LCD) units.
Political power has seen major shifts over the last five decades.
In 2000, Taiwan underwent its first peaceful transfer of power form the Nationalist to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), currently headed by President Chen Shui-bian.
To ensure its future competitiveness, the government is working to restructure its financial sector as well as attract investment in infrastructure and emerging sectors such as biotechnology, digital content, nanotechnology and auto electronics.
Taiwan is widely known as China’s largest source of foreign investment, mainly due to its low-cost manufacturing sector.
In 2005, over half of Taiwan’s foreign investment was located in China, and China and Hong Kong received roughly 40% of Taiwan’s exports.
Gross Domestic Product (2006) GDP GDP growth GDP/capita (PPP) US$353.9 billion 4.4%(2006) 4.4 (2007e) US$29,000
• The budget deficit is expected to narrow to an estimated 2.6% in 2008 from the 2006 value of 2.8%.
• Consumer price inflation is forecast to weaken in 2007-08 and the Taiwan dollar is expected to appreciate against the US dollar.
• The current-account surplus will narrow from an estimated 4.9% in 2006 to an annual average of 4.3% of GDP in 2007-08.
Consumer Market Taiwan’s densely populated consumer market is becoming increasingly attractive to Canadian exporters.
Taiwanese consumers are welcoming of North American-style foods, such as ready-made products, with various consumer groups adopting eating habits reflective of North American and European markets.
Consumer demands are accommodated through Taiwan’s growing modern retail food sector and foodservice industry.
The average Taiwanese household consists of three people, with the number of single-person households on the rise.
Food and beverage expenditures represent Taiwan’s highest spending category, with consumers spending roughly 23% of income on such items.
Increasing quantities of ready-meals are purchased from convenience stores and growing demand for international selections represents an opportunity for Canadian exporters.
In 2006, Taiwan had over 8,700 chained convenience stores, representing the highest density of convenience stores in the world.
President Chain Store (owner of 7-Eleven) is Taiwan’s largest convenience chain player in ready-made meals.
Ready-to-eat meals are also highly popular in hypermarkets and supermarkets.
In 2005, sales of ready-to-eat meals accounted for roughly 30-40% of total food sales in these outlets.
Many consumers (urban and rural) do the majority of shopping in these retail chains.
Nonetheless, certain segments of the population prefer to shop at open markets on a daily basis because they believe food to be fresher at these locations.
Three major cities in Taiwan are: o Kaohsiung City - the largest city in the South.
It is Taiwan's most crowded urban area with roughly 9,900 persons per square km in 2006. o Taipei - located in the north, and is the capital and economic centre of Taiwan with over 9,650 persons per square km in 2006.
Taipei had the highest mean annual gross and disposable income per capita income in 2006, approximately 1.5 times higher than the national average. o Taichung City - located in the central area and is the third most populated area, with 6,300 persons per square km in 2006.
Lucrative Consumer Segments
• Baby Boomers/Ageing Population o Middle-aged adults make up the largest population segment in Taiwan.
This group increased to 44% of the total population in 2005, and is expected to increase to 48% by 2015.
This age segment is increasingly busy, concerned with their health and are currently more wealthy than middle-aged Taiwanese in the past. o Baby boomers (aged 40-59) have most benefited from the rapid growth of Taiwan's economy and also hold Taiwan’s wealth.
Leader International Business Tank estimates suggest that over 50% of national wealth is held by baby boomers. o Over the last two decades, Taiwan’s elderly population has increased while there has been a steady decline in the number of children born.
This group accounted for almost 47% of the total population in 2005.
As a result, the single population is the target market for various food and beverage products in Taiwan, particularly convenience foods. o There is an increasing prevalence of unmarried women 30 years of age or older.
In current terms, the average age of marriage for women remains at 27 years and 31 years for men.
Taiwanese are large consumers of snack products, typically cooked or uncooked options from convenience stores, tea shops and street food stalls.
Working women, however, are more drawn to healthier options in ready-to-eat or ready-to-cook snacks and meals.
This increase can be attributed to concerns of water quality and a focus on healthy living.
In 2005, the value of imported fish and seafood products had over 250% more value than that of its domestic product.
Packaged and proceed foods: o From 2000-05, ready-meal consumption had the highest growth in the packaged and processed food market.
During this period, ready-meal products increased roughly 575% from 600g per capita to 4kgs per capita consumption. o Chilled, processed food was the second fastest growing packaged and processed food sector.
Per capita consumption of chilled processed foods increased by over 515% from 600g to 4kg from 2000-05.
Chilled ready-meals grew by 18% in 2006 and made up about 17% of all chilled processed food sales in the same year. o Both canned/preserved and frozen ready meals are expected to see a rapid increase in product range between 2006 and 2011.
Volume of sales for both sub-sectors is expected to increase by about 30% during this period.
Ready-meals are extremely popular among consumers and the market for international ready-meals with innovative flavouring is growing.
On average, retail value sales are expected to grow by 4% each year, to reach US$4.3 million in constant value terms in 2011.
Foodservice Industry
• According to a 2006 survey, most of the Taiwanese workers have three meals away from the home every day.
The results show that 65% of breakfasts, 81% of lunches, 46% of dinners, and even 21% of late night snacks are eaten out of the home among workers aged 25-40 years.
Eating out has become a norm in Taiwan and influences the entire food industry.
For lunch in urban areas, people commonly eat takeaway lunch boxes or purchase food from street stalls.
Cafés/bars and full service restaurants are more popular for dinner, and self-service cafeterias, convenience stores and fast food restaurants are popular for both mealtimes.
Competitors The United States is Canada’s top competitor in the Taiwanese food market.
The U.S. is Taiwan’s most important source for agriculture and agri-food imports and supplies four out of five of Taiwan’s top imported products, which are corn, soybeans, cotton, and food preparations.
Japan is a top supplier of tobacco products, which represents Taiwan’s third largest import commodity.
Canadian exporters must also compete with Taiwan’s growing trade relationship with China.
Taiwan’s Top Five Agriculture and Agri-Food Suppliers Country United States Japan Australia New Zealand China Canada (10th place)
Import Value (2005 CAN $) $3,200 million $801.3 million $748.5 million $460.3 million $388.1 million $211.1 million
Access Issues Agricultural commodities and food products entering the Taiwanese market must pass quarantine and inspection by both the Bureau of Standards Metrology and Inspection (BSMI) and Taiwan’s Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine.
Exporting to Taiwan is not a high concern in terms of transport and distribution logistics.
These concerns can be handled by a local importer or distributor.
However, Canadian exporters shipping products to Taiwan should consider the country’s Harbour Construction Fee (i.e. 0.3% of the declared value of a shipment is levied on all goods arriving by ocean carrier).
In addition, there is a 5% value-added tax (VAT) levied on all products.
Canadian exporters are encouraged to check with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) for the most up-to-date health and phytosanitary certification requirements, as they are subject to occasionally change.
"Cold calling" is not accepted business practice when attempting to export to Taiwan.
Canadian exporters can find credible business partners through the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).

• Taiwanese business people have a reputation of being tough negotiators.
The exchange of business cards and gifts is customary in Taiwan.
Gift-giving usually occurs at the end of meetings or during a meal.
The sector is largely represented by elderly farmers (those over 65 account for roughly 45% of the labour force), as its young population is drawn to careers in Taiwan’s booming service sector.
Its main agricultural products are rice, corn, vegetables, fruit, tea, pigs, poultry, beef, milk and fish.
Agricultural imports have also increased due to the country’s accession.
The Taiwanese government’s Challenge 2008 National Development Plan includes plans to upgrade the agricultural sector.
These plans include investment in horticultural and agricultural biotechnology and the revitalization of rural Taiwan.
A significant development in the industry includes an effort to become more knowledge-based with the Agricultural e-commerce and Chinese Agricultural Standards (CAS) systems in place.
These programs aid in developing high-tech and recreational agriculture and aims to adjust the use of agricultural resources.

Introduction The opportunity to export pasta to both Hong Kong and Taiwan are growing as the two affluent Asian markets have capable consumer bases that are becoming more demanding of this product.
The growth of the pasta markets can be partially attributed to its popularity in the foodservice industries, which has encouraged consumers to prepare pasta dishes at home.
Pasta is available in supermarkets and hypermarkets, and is widely accepted as a substitute for the country’s main staple food, rice.
Research to-date suggests that dried pasta is the only form of pasta with a notable presence in these markets.
Consumer knowledge of pasta products (i.e. canned/preserved and chilled/fresh) is very low as these products are not widely available on the market.
Canadian presence in the Hong Kong and Taiwanese markets varies from year to year, with more success achieved in Hong Kong.
In 2006, Canada exported almost $71,300 worth of pasta, while in the same year, only $1,900 was exported to Taiwan.
Over the last ten years, Canada has either supplied no pasta, or a very insignificant amount of pasta to Taiwan.
All findings included below are based on Canadian agriculture and agri-food statistics from the Canadian Agri-Food Trade System (CATS) (data from Statistics Canada) and reports from Euromonitor.
Asia Pacific Pasta Market Throughout Asia, pasta trends and availability mirror the markets of Hong Kong and Taiwan.
In many product categories, specifically food, these two markets set regional trends and act as a spring board for launching new products region-wide.
Euromonitor reports that since 2001, most categories of pasta have seen considerable growth at the retail level.
Dried pasta dominates the region with sales of US$1.08 billion in 2006, up from US$779.6 million in 2001.
Currently, dried pasta accounts for roughly 95% of retail pasta sales in Asia Pacific.
Chilled/fresh pasta has also seen growth, rising from US$45.3 million in 2001 to over US$60.4 million in 2006.
Annual growth of between US$3 to US$5 million was seen through 2003, with growth of roughly US$1 million annually since.
Despite growth in some categories, canned/preserved pasta products have seen sales fall 50%, from roughly US$1.5 million in 2001 to US$740,000 in 2006.
Growth of canned pasta had been strong, reaching US$1.8 million in 2003, but has since fallen considerably.
Global Market Information Database - Euromonitor International 2007)
Overview of Hong Kong’s Pasta Market
• The market for pasta in Hong Kong increased by 5% from 2005-06 (% current value growth) to reach US$9.5 million.
At present, dried pasta is the only sub sector making headway in the Hong Kong market.
Pasta is forecast to increase in value by an average of 6.2% each year from 2006-2011, to reach sales of more than US$13 million by 2011.
In 2006, Canada exported $71,288 worth of pasta to the Hong Kong market.
Trends and Market Prospects for the Future
• Pasta is gaining more presence in the Hong Kong food market as it becomes more popular in the foodservice industry and is increasing availability at supermarkets and hypermarkets.
Pasta is becoming more affordable to Hong Kong’s consumers, and as local income rises, consumers have demonstrated a willingness to purchase higherend products.
Pasta sales in Hong Kong increased in value and volume sales in 2006.
Western cuisine has increased in popularly in recent years (2001-2006).
Western restaurants such as California Pizza Kitchen and Cova Ristorante have entered the Hong Kong market, helping to boost pasta’s popularity.
This also helps to encourage consumers to recreate different pasta dishes at home.
Product education (for example, through recipe distribution) may be useful to increase knowledge and interest in different types of pasta available.
Value sales of pasta have increased at a faster rate than volume sales, as the unit price saw an increase from 2001-2006.
Pasta is imported mainly from Italian suppliers and is sold at premium prices.
Supermarkets/hypermarkets seldom have discounts on pasta and private label products (mainly targeted to lower income groups) and are therefore not popular at these particular outlets as the premium price product is a pour match for the typical consumers at these retail chains.
An increase in the distribution channels of pasta could in turn increase convenience for consumers.
Selling pasta in independent food stores and discounters may achieve success in reaching a wider, more lower-income consumer base.
While still a very small export value for Canada, totals have risen from less than $10,000 in 1996 to over $71,000 in 2006.
Unlike totals for the region, as a whole, Canada’s exports are not dominated by dried pasta.
While stuffed pasta represents the most opportunity for export in 2006, the market share distribution of pasta types changed year-to-year from 20032006.
Pasta Type (2003-2006) Type Uncooked pasta, not stuffed or otherwise prepared, containing eggs Uncooked pasta, not stuffed or prepared, nes Stuffed pasta, whether or not cooked or otherwise prepared Pasta nes 2003 $23,034 2004 $45,611 2005 $30,021 2006 $8,171 4-Yr Total $110,837

Pasta – Hong Kong, China (Nov.
In 2006, pasta sales increased by 5% in value, and 4% in terms of volume growth from the previous year.
From 2001-2006, on average, pasta sales grew 3.5% in terms of value, and almost 3% in volume.
Over the forecast period (2006-2011), the sale of pasta is expected to increase by an average of 6.2% in terms of value, and 5.1% by volume, with dried pasta remaining the only pasta type to achieve sales in the Hong Kong market.
Key Players in Hong Kong’s Pasta Market
Barilla is popular among consumers due to its reasonable price.
It offers a wide range of pasta (i.e. lasagna, penne, spaghetti, tortellini, etc.). Barilla saw an increase in brand retail value share of half a percentage point between 2002 and 2005.
Consumers prefer Italian pasta for the taste and therefore Italian suppliers dominate the Hong Kong market.
The top pasta brands (as determined by pasta brand % retail value asp) are the following: o Barilla (Barilla G e R Flli SpA) o Dolmio (Master Foods Asia Pacific Ltd.) o San Remo (San Remo Macaroni Co.) o Buitoni (Nestle Hong Kong Ltd.)
Overview of Taiwan’s Pasta Market
• Retail volume growth of pasta reached 4% in 2006, with sales of 1,300 tonnes or US$3.3 million in the Taiwanese market.
On average, retail value sales are expected to grow by 4% each year, to reach US$4.3 million in constant value terms in 2011.
Like in Hong Kong, dried pasta is currently the only form of pasta showing success in this market.
The popularity of pasta is growing in Taiwan, as a number of people consume pasta on a daily basis and no longer consider it a luxury item.
In 2006, the general unit price of pasta increased.
• Like in the Hong Kong market, dried pasta is the only widely available pasta type in Taiwan.
There could be potential for chilled pasta to be exported to Taiwan in the future as demand for convenience products rises.
Brands of chilled pasta are already available in Taiwan by I-Mei Foods, Jing Ping Foods, and Laurel Enterprises Corporation.
Increased participation from multinationals is also expected during the 2006-2011 period.
The foodservice industry includes pasta on menus, and should help boost consumer interest in the product.
The average unit price of pasta increased in 2006, and this is expected to increase in the future as the consumer market becomes more sophisticated.
Consumers are beginning to seek out different types of pasta for meals at home.
Health and wellness pasta is not yet marketable to Taiwanese consumers as pasta has not yet reached enough popularity, and would confuse consumers.
Canada’s Pasta Exports to Taiwan Provided in $CAN amounts Canada’s exports of pasta to Taiwan have been sporadic at best with less that $40,000 in total pasta exports over the past 10 years.

From 2001-2006, on average pasta sales grew 4% in terms of value, and 3.1% in volume.
Over the forecast period, on average the sale of pasta is expected to increase each year by 5.3% (in terms of value), with dried pasta remaining the only pasta type to achieve sales in the Taiwanese market.
Key Players in Taiwan’s Pasta Market
• Market share values (% retail value rsp) of the top four companies were represented by the following in 2005. o Lien Hwa Industrial Corp. – 63% o Advance Finer Foods Inc.
– 10% o Lin de Yuan Inc.
Consumers generally do not have high brand loyalty to pasta companies.
• Both Ivy and Romantacist brands are available in most supermarkets/hypermarkets, while imported brands such as De Cecco and San Remo were limited to higher-end supermarkets/hypermarkets.
These brands are also 30-50% more expensive than local brands.
While increasing in popularity, pasta is not considered a staple product in Taiwan.
Manufacturers have only had a lukewarm reception to their marketing campaigns so far, which explains low brand loyalty among consumers.

Japanese Imports of Fish and Fisheries Products - Total
Japanese Imports of Fish and Fisheries Products from the World by Species DESCRIPTION OF GOODS JAN-DEC 2000 2001 +/- Q'TY VALUE Q'TY VALUE 01/00 M/T YEN MILL M/T YEN MILL Q'TY VALUE 1.
Noteworthy for this group of fish in 2001 is a sharp decline of imports of eel fry for farming, which was reduced to almost none from 9,419 kg and 1.518 billion yen in 2000 to 539 kg and 17 million yen in 2001.
Fresh, Chilled or Frozen Fish Imports of this group of fish recorded an increase of 2.1% from 2,636,986 mt in 2000 to 2,691,594 mt in 2001 but the yen import value recorded a decrease of 2.3% from 1,283.207 billion yen in 2000 to 1,253.692 billion yen in 2001.
Shrimp and prawn has not changed its position as the largest import item among all fish import items.
The Japanese market for shrimp and prawn remained soft throughout 2001.
The second largest import item in this group was salmon and trout.
An abnormally large influx of farmed coho from Chile into Japan in 2001 has eroded the Japanese salmon market.
While a reduction of farming of Chilean coho was announced for 2002, it is, reportedly, only a 5% decrease and Japanese trade people wonder how much this announced decrease of production may have positive effects on the recovery of the salmon market in Japan.
Imports of big-eye tuna increased by 4.4% in volume from 134,734 mt in 2000 to 140,644 mt in 2001 but the yen import value decreased by 4.8% from 96.164 billion yen in 2000 to 91.548 billion yen in 2001.
Yellowfin tuna recorded a substantial decreased in 2001, by 11.9% in terms of volume from 136,436 mt in 2000 to 120,218 mt in 2001 and by 9.7% from 55.021 billion yen in 2000 to 49.71 billion yen in 2001.
On the other hand, imports of bluefin tuna recorded a substantial increase of 11.5% from 14,274 mt in 2000 to 15,915 mt in 2001 and the yen import value also increased by 16.9% from 35.497 billion yen in 2000 to 41.487 billion yen in 2001.
Imports of southern bluefin tuna also increased in 2001, by 6.3% from 10,357 mt in 2000 to 11,013 mt in 2001 and the yen import value increased by 9.7% from 20.809 billion yen in 2000 to 22.828 billion yen in 2001.
For albacore, imports from Canada accounted for more than 25% of the total import of this species in 2001.
Of this total import of crab, imports of snow crab decreased by 7.3% in volume from 60,920 mt in 2000 to 56,476 mt in 2001 and the yen import value decreased by 19.8% from 44.623 billion yen in 2000 to 35.776 billion yen in 2001.
In particular, imports from Canada recorded a sharp decrease of 45.4% in volume from 16,050 mt in 2000 to 8,765 mt in 2001 and the yen import value decreased by 46.5% from 17.31 billion yen in 2000 to 9.252 billion yen in 2001.
Imports of snow crab from Russia increased by 4.5% in volume from 33,971 mt in 2000 to 35,486 mt in 2001 and the yen import value also increased by 1.1% from 18.997 billion yen in 2000 to 19.197 billion yen in 2001.
The Japanese government has decided to adopt, as of April 1, 2002, a stricter administration policy toward imports of fish from Russia, in particular various crabs, some of which have been suspected to be poached and smuggled into Japan.
It is too early to comment on the effects of this measure on the actual import of fish from Russia into Japan throughout 2002.
Salted, Dried or Smoked Fish Imports of salted herring roe, the largest item in this group, decreased in terms of both volume and yen value: by 6.9% from 8,510 mt in 2000 to 7,920 mt in 2001 and by 6.1% from 12.897 billion yen in 2000 to 12.116 billion yen in 2001.
Unprocessed roe packaged in pails have become popular as well.
Imports of salted salmon roe decreased by 5.4% from 4,662 mt in 2000 to 4,410 mt in 2001 but the yen import value recorded only a slight decrease of 0.6% from 6.872 billion yen in 2000 to 6.832 billion yen in 2001.
While imports of salted salmon roe from the United States decreased by 10.1% from 3,451 mt in 2000 to 3,104 mt in 2001, imports of salmon roe extracted from farmed salmon which were imported from European countries, such as Denmark and Finland, increased sharply in 2001: imports from Denmark by 11.6% from 596 mt in 2000 to 665 mt in 2001 and those from Finland by 5.8% from 295 mt in 2000 to 312 mt in 2001.
Rapidly increased imports of eel products at low prices had serious effects on the eel farming in Japan and there was a strong opinion among the Japanese farmers that a safeguard measure should be implemented on imports.
While the Japanese government did not take such a measure, a movement among the Japanese industry has affected the import of this product in 2001.
Imports from Canada Japan's imports of fish and fisheries products from Canada decreased by 7.1% from 63,825 mt in 2000 to 59,269 mt in 2001.
The yen import value recorded a decrease of 15.5% from 58.826 billion yen in 2000 to 49.736 billion yen in 2001.
Imports of finfish from Canada increased by 16.3% from 17,861 mt in 2000 to 20,777 mt in 2001 and the Canadian dollar import value increased by 5.4% from Cdn$142.306 million in 2000 to Cdn$149.921 million in 2001.
Contrary to the Japanese market, the US market for domestic consumption was very strong.
These factors combined contributed to such a sharp decrease in import of snow crab in 2001.
Imports of shrimp and prawn recorded also a sharp decrease in 2001.
The volume of import decreased by 16.3% from 9,410 mt in 2000 to 7,878 mt in 2001 and the Canadian dollar import value decreased by 27.1% from Cdn$106.017 million in 2000 to Cdn$77.249 million in 2001.
The market for northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) was softened worldwide throughout 2001.
Imports of molluscs (almost 100% of this being surf clam) recorded a decrease of 11.4% from 2,781 mt in 2000 to 2,465 mt in 2001 and the Canadian dollar import value decreased by 13.6% from Cdn$30.407 million in 2000 to Cdn$26.258 million in 2001.
Of the group other than finfish and crustaceans and molluscs, the volume of import of salted herring roe in 2001 was almost the same as in 2000 at 4,260 mt in 2000 and 4,264 mt in 2001.
However, the Canadian dollar import value of this important export item to Japan decreased by 13.0% from Cdn$116.1 million in 2000 to Cdn$101.01 million in 2001.
On the other hand, imports of frozen herring roe from Canada recorded a decrease of 5.4% in volume from 4,238 mt in 2000 to 4,011 mt in 2001 but the Canadian dollar import value increased by 20.5% from Cdn$26.751 million in 2000 to Cdn$32.233 million in 2001.
A substantial decrease in production of this roe in Ireland has contributed to increasing import price for Canadian roe.
Of the salmon roe import, imports of sujiko from Canada in 2001 increased by 14.5% from 131 mt in 2000 to 150 mt in 2001 but those of ikura decreased by 28.4% from 454 mt in 2000 to 325 mt in 2001.
Poorer landings of chum salmon in 2000 than 2001 led to a decrease in the production and export of ikura in 2001.
Japanese Imports of Fish and Fisheries Products - from Canada
The Japanese Market Given the continuing economic recession and employment uneasiness with no recovery of personal consumption expenditures, the market of fish and fisheries products, as in the case of other products, has not recovered yet.
In the market, expensive fish and fisheries products do not sell well.
While it is reported that the outbreak of mad cow disease (BSE) had positive effects on the consumption of fish, its effects have not been so great as to change the weakened fish market.
The expenditures on consumption per household for 2001 published by the Japanese government recorded a decrease of 2.7% in nominal terms and 1.8% in real terms (after the adjustment by price fluctuation) from 2000.
The expenditures have continued to decrease for nine consecutive years since 1993 after the crush of Japanese bubble economy.
This is the longest period of continuing decrease since the government introduced the current system of survey in 1963.
According to this survey, expenditures on food, fish and fisheries products and dining out have decreased for four consecutive years.
The total expenditures per household in 2001, i.e., 3,704,298 yen, were lower than those expenditures ten years ago (3,734,084 yen in 1990).
The expenditures on food per household in 2001 were 943,313 yen (nominal terms), which were lower than 948,104 yen in 1984.
Of these expenditures on food, those spent on fish and fisheries products were 106,101 yen (nominal), which recorded a decrease of 3.7% from 2000 and lower than 108,692 yen in 1977.
Given the deflationary phase of the Japanese economy, these declining tendency are expected to continue, putting a substantial pressure on the market price of fish and fisheries products in Japan.
Salmon Imports of frozen salmon recorded a historical high in 2001 with 244,414 mt, which was an increase of 20.5% from 202,827 mt in 2000.
A sharp increase in imports of farmed coho from Chile was to be noted.
Imports of frozen coho salmon amounted to 88,577 mt in 2001, an increase of 32.4% from 66,910 mt in 2000.
Of these imports, those from Chile represented 84,804 mt, an increase of 33.6% from 63,488 mt in 2001.
Despite such a sharp increase in volume, the yen import value for Chilean coho decreased by 14.5% from 32.230 billion yen in 2000 to 27.568 billion yen in 2001.
Imports of frozen trout from Chile also recorded a sharp increase, 44.3% from 33,096 mt in 2000 to 47,744 mt in 2001.
Despite such an increase, the yen import value decreased by 1.4% from 15.418 billion yen in 2000 to 15.198 billion yen in 2001.
These increases were the major reason for extremely soft salmon market in Japan in 2001.
Salmon Roe (Sujiko and Ikura) Total imports of sujiko amounted to 4,410 mt in 2001, a decrease of 5.4% from 4,662 mt in 2000.
Imports from Canada increased by 14.5% from 131 mt in 2000 to 150 mt in 2001 and the yen import value increased by 20.6% from 180 million yen in 2000 to 217 million yen in 2001.
In addition to these imports of sujiko, there are imports of frozen sujiko from Russia, which is not specified in the customs tariff.
According to a fish trade paper (Hokkai Keizai Shimbun) estimate, imports of those frozen sujiko from Russia amounted to 5,762 mt and 4.901 billion yen in 1999; 6,774 mt and 9.886 billion yen in 2000; and 6,011 mt and 8.780 billion yen in 2001.
These sujiko are processed into seasoned sujiko in Japan.
The volume of imports from Canada decreased by 28.4% from 454 mt in 2000 to 325 mt in 2001 and the yen import value decreased by 44.4% from 1.332 billion yen in 2000 to 741 million yen in 2001.
It is estimated that due to poor landings of chum salmon in Canada and the United States, pink salmon ikura occupied a substantial portion of imports from these two countries.
The greater decrease in the yen import value for Canadian ikura than the decrease in the import volume is attributable to increased imports of low-priced chum ikura.
For the current wholesale prices of sujiko and ikura, please refer to the table included in this report.

Herring Roe and Herring Roe on Kelp (a) Salted Herring Roe A "polarization" of salted herring roe in the consumer market, i.e., one as a traditional expensive year-end gift and other as an ordinary consumption food at the new-year days, has been accelerated in 2001.
The demand for salted herring roe products was strong for so-called "brand goods" processed by a few processors.
On the other hand, salted herring roe products packaged in cheap styrofoam tray and wrapped with vinyl film sold well for general consumption at the new-year days.
While those brand goods were sold at expensive prices, the prices of those for general consumption had to be low regardless of the quality of products.
In addition to this structural change of sales of salted herring roe products, seasoned herring roe products made of Pacific herring roe were sold well for general new-year consumption because of its readiness of eating, as no desalting is required for these products.
Trade people grope for ways of consumption of salted herring roe as materials for year-round consumption food, on which the future of salted herring roe in the Japanese market is said to depend.
The total import of frozen herring roe in 2000 decreased by 11.0% from 5,660 mt in 2000 to 5,037 mt.
With this decreased supply in 2001, the inventory of frozen herring roe carried over to this year is, reportedly, not large and with the decreased supply from Ireland, the demand for Canadian roe is anticipated to be strong this year.
The average import price (CIF) increased, for Canadian products, from 2,118 yen per kg in 2000 to 2,222 yen in 2001.
Products of less expensive grades are now used for low-priced kaiten (with belt-conveyor) sushi bars or for takeout sushi shops.
Crab The total volume of import of snow crab decreased by 7.3% from 60,920 mt in 2000 to 56,476 mt in 2001 and the yen import value decreased by 19.8% from 44.623 billion yen in 2000 to 35.776 billion yen in 2001.
A sharp decrease of 45.4% in the volume of import from Canada from 16,050 mt in 2000 to 8,765 mt in 2001 was the major factor for the sharp decline in the total volume of imports.
The average yen import price (CIF) into Japan for Canadian snow crab did not change substantially (i.e., 1,078 yen per kg in 2000 and 1,056 yen in 2001).
The demand for snow crab was strong for consumption in the United States, and Japanese importers could not "win" the so-called "purchasing competition" with US buyers.
As mentioned earlier in this report, imports of snow crab and king crab at low prices from Russia have had adverse effects on snow crab imported from Canada in the consumer market.
It has been said for a long time that substantial portion of live snow crab and king crab imported from Russia was poached in Russian waters and imported illegally into Japan.
In 2001, Russia exported 13,616 mt of frozen king crab (18,759 mt in 2000) and 13,227 mt of frozen snow crab (11,687 mt in 2000) to Japan.
The country also exported, in 2001, 22,393 mt of live/fresh king crab (20,932 mt in 2000) and 22,259 mt of live/fresh snow crab (22,284 in 2000) to Japan.
The average import price for Russian snow crab (CIF) was 541 yen per kg in 2001 and that for king crab was 860 yen per kg.
When a large quantity is imported, the volume distributed in the market increases greatly and the price goes down, reducing the market price of frozen crab imported from other countries including Canada.
The agreement between the Japanese and Russian government to eliminate imports of poached snow crab from Russia to Japan is expected to rectify the long existing abnormal trade practice for crab imported from Russia.
Those imports from Russia were large-sized and import prices were lowered in 2001 (from 1,148 yen per kg in 2000 to 888 yen in 2001).
Lobster While the volume of live and frozen lobster from Canada and the United States in 2001 decreased from 2000, the average yen import price increased in 2001.
This decline is attributed by industry people to poor landings of lobster at the beginning of season for production of frozen products.
Given the lasting economic recession, the market for this expensive import item has not recovered yet as a whole.
Herring Imports of food herring from major exporting countries decreased substantially in 2001 and Japanese herring processors have faced shortage of supply of materials for processing of herring products.
The major reason for this decease is, reportedly, increased sales from Russian to European countries.
According to trade people, this shortage of supply of food herring is expected for this year.
Japanese Imports of Frozen Herring (Unit:
The domestic price of black cod has been decreasing from its peak price of 1,400 yen per kg in the current year.
While the suspension of fishing was announced for the Canadian black cod on January 18 this year, it has been resumed on March 18 with a reduced quota of 2,800 mt, according to trade people.
It is reported that, at the present, Japanese trade people have adopted a "wait and see" attitude toward those imports from both countries.
Redfish The volume of total import of redfish in 2001 recorded a sharp decrease of 19.9% from 47,837 mt in 2000 to 38,300.
One of the major reasons for this decrease is said to be a strike by fishermen at the beginning of 2001 season.
Imports of redfish from other major exporting countries also recorded a substantial decrease in 2001.
Norwegian exporters organized a bargaining committee to negotiate the export price of capelin with Japanese importers but, due to a substantial difference between the two parties, the negotiations were deadlocked.
Japanese industry people hold that no shipment will be made before the end of May.
Reportedly, the import prices to which the Japanese side adheres are NOK12.5 (C&F per kg, at 100% female conversion) for the size of 41-45 counts per kg; NOK10.50 for 46-50 counts, and NOK7.00-8.00 for 51-55 counts (at Yen 16.17 to NOK).
These prices are lower by approximately NOK3.00 per kg than the prices which the Norwegian side has asked for, i.e., NOK15.25 for 41-45 counts, NOK13.75 for 46-70 counts and NOK11.75 for 51-55 counts.
With the deadlock in negotiations, all Japanese importers have left Norway and there is no plan to resume the talks soon.
However, given the current very soft consumer market for capelin, where a substantial portion of capelin products processed in China has been dumped, the quantity agreed for the Norwegian capelin would be an oversupply, according to some industry people.
They also hold that the marketability of Newfoundland capelin depends completely on the size, which should be larger than under-40 counts per kg.
Sea Urchin Imports of sea urchin roe from Canada decreased by 11.1% from 550 mt in 2000 to 489 mt in 2001 but the yen import value recorded only a 1.9% decrease, which resulted in an increase of the average yen import price from 4,044 yen per kg in 2000 to 4,461 yen in 2001.
Imports from the United States recorded a decrease of 14.5% from 1,896 mt in 2000 to 1,622 mt in 2001 and the yen import value increased by 16.1% from 10.823 billion yen in 2000 to 9.085 billion yen (the average import price increased from 5,708 yen per kg in 2000 to 5,600 yen in 2001).
Noteworthy are imports from Chile, which now account for 40% of the total imports of sea urchin roes into Japan.
Of the total import from Chile in 2001, fresh sea urchin roe occupied 675 mt and frozen sea urchin roe 1,483 mt.
Chilean frozen sea urchin roes are mainly used as material for secondary sea urchin roe products, while the roes from other countries are sold without further processing in Japan.
Market Information Asia Pacific Seafood - Market Overview China June, 2003 Prepared by the Canadian Embassy, Beijing
Introduction The potential market for seafood in China in the longer term is huge.
China imported US$1.6 billion of fishery products in 2002 which is nearly triple the value of five years earlier.
It is expected that Chinese seafood imports will continue to increase at a healthy rate, in large part because of the increasing interest by foreign companies to have the processing done in China where costs are much lower and a higher recovery rate can be achieved.
Currently, the consumer market for seafood is primarily located in the coastal cities of China where consumers tend to have more disposable income as well as being more familiar with seafood products.
Many Canadian seafood products will be geared to the high-end premium market of the affluent and middle class consumers with increasing incomes.
China's accession to the WTO will result in major reductions over the next several years to the high customs tariffs levied on imported seafood products and create excellent longer term market prospects.
Tariff reductions on major Canadian seafood export products including cold water shrimp, lobster, crab and salmon in particular will create significant opportunities for enhanced export levels of these products.
Market Characteristics China has the world's largest fishery products output with some 45 million tons of production.
About 60 percent of the production is aquaculture and the balance caught at sea.
The per capita consumption of fishery products is not high, about 4 kilos per capita in rural areas and 10 kilos per capita in urban areas.
China is a vast potential market for seafood which will grow as living standards of the Chinese people increase.
Seafood processing is currently concentrated in coastal cities like Dalian and Qingdao.
Due to poor nation-wide infrastructure, shortage of refrigerated equipment and short shelf life of fresh seafood, the market is primarily oriented to coastal-2- cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
Supplies come from China's own coastal sea waters and offshore fisheries, freshwater products raised in local waters, farmer's rice fields or ponds, and imported product.
Seafood, due its generally high cost, is consumed by the affluent population in coastal cities of China while freshwater products are consumed throughout China.
Foreign seafood is generally more expensive because of the importation costs.
Despite the higher prices, the younger, affluent Chinese are keen on trying out foreign seafood which may be different from domestic product.
Familiar products, such as cold water shrimp are in tremendous demand as China's shrimp aquaculture stocks were almost wiped out in the early 1990s from disease.
Other seafood market opportunities available to foreign exporters are related to the local market preferences in China.
For example, Chinese traders are interested in fish heads and bellies which are usually discarded or sold at minimal prices in North America when fish is processed for fillets.
Also there is a good market for "undersized" fish.
In China, a 200-500 gram fish, with its head and tail on, is regarded as the perfect size for steaming, a popular way to cook fish in China.
Unlike the younger generations, the older generations of Chinese people are very price sensitive and therefore, price becomes the determining factor in their purchasing decisions.
Furthermore many of the older generations prefer to shop at traditional wet markets where there are fewer opportunities to know the origins of the seafood.
Seafood sold at these markets are either fresh or alive in barrels of water.
They are not packaged or labeled with information about the products' geographic origin and nutritional value.
In general consumers prefer live seafood.
When live seafood is too expensive, frozen seafood is the next choice followed by canned or dried seafood products like dried cuttlefish, a very popular Chinese snack.
There is no single dominant supplier of seafood products.
The market for Canadian fish and seafood products is in the larger affluent cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.
The primary end users of Canadian product are the higher end hotels and Chinese seafood restaurants.
China's Seafood Imports China's imports of seafood products have increased at a dramatic rate during the past five years nearly tripling in volume to US$1.6 billion in 2002.
The high import duty rates on seafood products has encouraged many importers to find methods to evade tariffs by shipping their goods via Hong Kong to China without the normal documented records.
Consequently official figures from the Chinese government regarding China's seafood imports may not be accurate because some seafood imports enter China through grey channels.
It is expected that this diversionary process will be used less as the tariffs reduce significantly under China's accession to the WTO and Customs laws are more vigorously enforced.
Major supplying countries Canada is the fifth largest supplier of seafood to the Chinese market and if present trends continue could become the third largest supplier within a few years.
The major export product of Russia, the largest supplier, is Alaska pollock for reprocessing.
It is interesting to note that the large majority of seafood imported by China is not for local consumption but for reprocessing with low cost labour and re-export.
Approximately 75% of all seafood imports come through the northern ports of Dalian and Qingdao where the seafood processing operations are centred.
China's Seafood Imports from Canada Canadian seafood exports to China have grown dramatically over the last five years, having increase more than four-fold from $50 million in 1997 to $207 million in 2002.
Crab and shrimp are the major export items.
Of particular interest is the increasing range of products being exported to China.
Distribution system After arriving at the ports, frozen seafood products destined for retail markets are shipped via China's railway and highway transportation network to the various cities for sale.
The distribution chain is as follows: the primary importers sell to local first-level wholesalers, who then transfer product to dealers, who in turn sell to retailers.
The main retail venues for seafood in China are the wet markets and food stores, however, much of the imported product would be sold through supermarkets or high end hotel and restaurants.
In addition to frozen seafood, there is a smaller but substantial market for live seafood in China.
Live seafood products are shipped by air and the main points of entry are Beijing and Shanghai.
Among the many live seafood products entering China are, dungeness crab, oysters, lobster, and geoduck clams from Canada, rock lobsters from Australia, and oysters from New Zealand.
Tariffs China's high seafood tariffs have been a significant impediment to long term growth of imports to China.
However, China's accession to the WTO has resulted in major reductions for a wide range of seafood products of interest to Canada as shown in the table below.
Regulations The importation of fish and shellfish is subject to different regulations and inspections depending on the product and the degree of processing.
The State General Administration for Quality Supervision and Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) issued new regulations covering aquatic products which became effective June 30, 2003.
These regulations cover the requirements for the inspection health certificate as well as labelling regulations.
A translation of the regulations can be found at: http://www.fas.usda.gov/gainfiles/200212/145784909.pdf Once all inspections have been cleared, seafood products will pass through China Customs where the CIF price (Cost+Insurance+Freight) is subject to the appropriate tariff.
In addition to the customs import tariff there is a Value Added Tax (VAT) on the CIF price of 3% for fresh seafood products and 17% for other seafood products.
Payment terms This process can be a challenge.
Payment conditions must be carefully negotiated, well understood and mutually acceptable between the buyer and the Canadian exporter before the trade transaction occurs.
Importers will aggressively seek the most favourable payment terms possible.
Many local companies may have difficulty accessing foreign currency.
For live seafood products the terms are generally cash or telegraphic transfer before they are shipped overseas by foreign suppliers.
Telegraphic transfers or wire transfers are simple and inexpensive to set up at the Bank of China but are generally used only for small value trade transactions.
Due to the uncertainties associated with doing business in China, many Canadian exporters like the comfort of using the export insurance guarantee provided by the Export Development Corporation.

About us Branding Canada's food and agriculture sector in international markets – Branding Canada for short – is: ▪ How we got started ▪ a federal-provincial-industry initiative led and funded by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada; ▪ designed to build a strong brand for Canada's food and agriculture sector in international markets; ▪ based on buyer and consumer research – in Canada's key export markets; and ▪ supported by a set of marketing tools.
AAFC's Branding Management Team works closely with the International Branding Working Group (IBWG), which is made up of representatives from the: ▪ Federal-Provincial Market Development Council (FPMDC) ▪ Value Chain Round Tables (VCRTs) ▪ Industry associations involved in the Canadian Agriculture and Food International (CAFI) Program ▪ Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) ▪ Canadian Grain Commission (CGC) ▪ Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) The IBWG was established in October 2004 to help develop and implement the branding strategy.
The IBWG made sure that the strategic approach taken – and the tools built – were useful and relevant to industry and other stakeholders.
The IBWG continues to provide advice to AAFC and plays a role in keeping stakeholders up-to-date on progress.
About us How we got started It began in June 2002 when the Federal-Provincial-Territorial Agriculture Ministers launched the Agricultural Policy Framework (APF) to help Canada's food and agriculture sector respond to changing consumer demands and increased global competition.
The APF was designed to position Canada as a world leader in food safety, innovation and environmentally responsible agricultural production.
Also key to the APF was the need to maximize international opportunities.
The Government pledged to work with industry to gain recognition for the sector, and developing a Canada brand became a key component of that commitment.
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada took the lead – formed the International Branding Working Group (IBWG) with members from industry and federal and provincial governments – and got to work.
A comprehensive, research-based branding strategy was developed and you'll find the results throughout this website: a unique brand promise, templates, graphics, consumer and buyer research in Canada's key export markets – and much more – all designed to enhance Canadian export opportunities, as promised.
Applying the brand in select markets Research in each of our priority markets - Germany, Japan, Mexico, United Kingdom and United States, as well as others - was used to identify different consumer and buyer segments by market.
▪ Germany ▪ Japan ▪ South Korea ▪ Mexico ▪ Singapore ▪ United Kingdom ▪ United States password protected It was found that different target market segments: ▪ desire different benefits; ▪ have different purchasing motives; and ▪ react differently to the Canada brand.
The research contains competitive information on how Canadian products and suppliers are perceived by consumers and buyers in our priority markets, which you could use to enhance your own strategic approach.
It doesn't mean changing the core of your brand and who you are for each market.
It just means that you emphasize different aspects of the Canada brand and showcase different advantages of it, depending on the customer.
Research and analysis is on-going and will continue to be added to this section as it becomes available.
About the research Dr. Louise Heslop analyzed much of the consumer data.
She is an internationally recognized country branding expert from the Eric Sprott School of Business at Carleton University in Ottawa.
The consumer research presentations posted on this website are based on her findings.
Lloyd Hetherington, Executive Vice President of Globescan Inc. oversaw all analysis of the buyer data.
He has worked in the food and beverage industry – in retailing, manufacturing, and now as a research supplier – for most of his career.
All of the studies are statistically significant at a 95 per cent level of confidence with a small margin of error.
But it's important to note that results are based on buyer and consumer perceptions and not necessarily actual experience.

Branding Canada takes to the streets and hits the news We've been diligently spreading the word about the Canada brand and the media have taken notice.
  Since September 2006, we've conducted seminars in all provinces with industry representatives and provincial officials.
As a result, Canada brand news has appeared in national newspapers, farm and fishery magazines, business journals, provincial government publications, and related community and national media, including radio and television!
We estimate we've reached nearly one million Canadians.
"This broad media coverage benefits our members by promoting the program and encouraging others to take up the Canada brand," said Sheila Barth, Branding Strategy manager with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

It produces and sells over 120 different varieties of fresh Manitoba-grown vegetables - including potatoes, carrots, onions and cabbage - and was one of the first companies to sign on to the Canada brand program.
"I truly believe that using the Canada brand has helped our company increase its sales," McIntosh told the gala audience.
"Canada is internationally known for being friendly, having clean, wide-open spaces and high quality food products.
It only makes sense to attach our name to the Canada brand."

Ideas, comments, questions, success stories…please share at brandcanada@agr.gc.ca! 
All of the tools, research and information you'll find on this website and in this section are designed to be adaptable.
The Canada brand is about setting high standards.
This section provides some suggestions for how to use and build the Canada brand for your industry, sub-sector or individual company.
The cereal grains industry is a case in point.
Through the Cereal Grains Value Chain Roundtable (VCRT)1, it has formally defined how the national brand promise translates into specific benefits and features connected to the cereals sub-sector.
The brand promise can also help you focus on how to consistently deliver positive impressions in line with benefits and features.
And using the brand look and feel across the sector, in all markets, will result in stronger impressions on customers. Whatever improvements you make, whether it's a new quality management system or formalized food safety regime, animal management and environmental procedures for all points along the value-chain, you are on your way to using and building the Canada brand.
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has worked in partnership with industry to establish Value Chain Roundtables (VCRTs) for the beef, pork, oilseeds, cereal grains, special crops, seafood and horticulture sectors.
Canada's food and agriculture is a dynamic sector clearly poised for more success.
Recent market research shows that Canada already has a positive image around the world.
We're known to be a trustworthy, reliable and competent people.
Our land is thought of as pristine, fresh and environmentally friendly.
Our food and agriculture products are considered safe, fresh, and natural.
Branding Canada for the food and agriculture sector - Branding Canada for short - was developed in close partnership with industry and provincial governments and is based on solid research.
This initiative is designed to help take Canada's strong international image and leverage it to increase the sales and profile of Canadian food and agriculture products.
Almost half of Canadian domestic food and agricultural production is exported either directly as primary products or indirectly as part of processed products.
Last year we exported over $30 billion (Cdn) worth of food and agriculture around the world!
So if you're involved in the export trade - whether you're from industry or government, you'll want to know more about the consumer and buyer market research we have from our key export markets, our tools and templates, the Canada brand graphics, our brand promise and much more.
They're all available on this website, with new material being added all the time.

What's New Canada Brand Pavilion at Foodex Japan a hit with industry Ottawa, March 2006 – All in all, Canadian exhibitors were more than pleased with the new Canada Brand pavilion at this year's Foodex Japan held near Tokyo from March 14-17.
  "It looked very sharp.
There was no mistaking the Canadian pavilion, I can tell you," said Jacques Pomerleau, Executive Director of Canada Pork International.
"It was completely different and a major improvement over last year.
There was good flow-through traffic.
We were well positioned and very happy with the space," she said.
  Amit Dutt, AAFC International Market Development Officer responsible for the Foodex Canada Pavilion, reported almost 2,500 exhibitors and close to 100,000 visitors attended the four-day event.
"The Canadian pavilion's live cooking demonstrations held each day were a huge hit with show visitors," Dutt said.
"Large crowds gathered around Chef Wayne Murphy as he spoke to them in Japanese while preparing his Asian-style recipes using Canadian ingredients.
We couldn't have asked for a more successful event!"
In total, 38 Canadian companies and five industry associations were at Foodex this year.
  It was the first time Carlos Costa of Ice Down Beverages, Vaughan, Ontario, attended the event.
While there, a Japanese television consumer show on the benefits of oxygen featured a bottle of Costa's 02 Aqua, oxygenated water.
"Within seconds sales went crazy!
Cell phones were ringing and everyone wanted to order our product," he said.
  Costa estimates that of his $4 million projected retail sales to Japan this year—his number one and fastest growing market—one-quarter of them will be directly related to having attended Foodex.
Pork leads the way, with an export value of $1.1 billion in 2005; oilseeds (canola and soybean) are second with over $900 million; and wheat is third, with an export value of almost $300 million, according to Statistics Canada.
Foodex Japan 2007 is scheduled for March 13 to 16, 2007 at Makuhari Messe in Chiba, near Tokyo, Japan.
Watch the Agri-Food Trade Service web site for upcoming information on this event.
What's New Mexico gets a taste of Canada Quebec, April 2006 – Consumer and buyer market research shows that even though Mexico is Canada's fourth most important export market, Mexicans don't really know a lot about Canadian food and agriculture products.
"These culinary tourism programs are especially interesting because they focus on value added, gourmet and culturally relevant products.
We have to take our international audience beyond wheat and maple syrup, although it's great that those Canadian commodities have such a high profile."
Quebec cuisine, the article notes, takes its inspiration from local tradition, an abundant supply of regional and seasonal ingredients and the creativity of young chefs.
It goes on to extol the variety of Canadian food products, including gourmet cheeses, meats, fish and seafood, ice wine, ciders and beer.  The Mexican media team dined on tasty foie gras in Quebec City, sipped perfectly chilled ice wine in Montreal and were treated to delectable caribou in Mont Tremblant during their four-day stay in March.
They were accompanied by representatives from AAFC and Tourism Québec.
  "The coverage we received was easily equal to the cost of the trip," Croux says.
"We're very happy with the results."
Croux adds that tourism has many of the same objectives when it comes to branding Canada's food and agriculture sector in international markets.
"I think we need to take more advantage of that synergy."
It was the second culinary tour organized for Mexican journalists.
The first tour visited Calgary, Alberta and Vancouver, British Columbia in October 2005.
Additional tours are planned for Ontario, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.  The tour was sponsored by Canadian Tourism Commission in Mexico, Tourism Québec, AAFC, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT).
What's New Canada brand tools showcased at annual meeting of Canada's ministers of agriculture St-John's, NFLD, June 2006 – Canada's efforts to brand Canadian agriculture and agri-food products in international markets were given a boost with the launch of the new branding Canada guide and Web site at the annual conference of federal, provincial and territorial agriculture ministers in St-John's, Newfoundland and Labrador.
Federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Chuck Strahl and his provincial and territorial counterparts enthused over the Canada brand exhibit, which showcased the new graphics, Web site and recently published branding guide, Quality is in our Nature:
A Guide to Building and Managing the Canada Brand for Food and Agriculture.
The branding strategy and tools—which include a research-based brand promise, consumer and buyer market research in Canada's key export markets and the Canada brand graphics—were developed in close collaboration with industry and provincial and territorial governments.
"This was a great venue to feature and promote the new Canada brand tools," said Sheila Barth, AAFC Branding Strategy Manager.
"To be a success, and give Canadian companies a competitive edge in international markets, the Canada brand strategy needs awareness from all levels of government, as well from the private sector.
This was a great step forward in achieving that."
"The good news is that the research showed that Canada and Canadians already have a positive image on the international stage," Barth said.
"The great news is that industry and government alike now have a series of strategic, research-based tools to take that strong image and leverage it to benefit the entire Canadian food and agriculture sector."
"There was a lot of enthusiasm about the potential of Branding Canada's tools to strengthen the sector's international reputation as a supplier of high-quality and safe foods," she added.
The World Trade Organization negotiations also featured prominently.
International trade is an important component of the Canadian agri-food sector.
Almost half of Canadian domestic food and agricultural production is exported either directly as primary products or indirectly as part of processed products.
Last year Canada exported over $30 billion (Cdn) worth of food and agriculture around the world.

What's New Pavilion at Foodex Japan wins design award Winnipeg, November 2006 - We knew this year's Canada pavilion at Foodex Japan, developed with the new Canada brand look and graphics, was a hit with stakeholders.
But now it's official!
The Canadian Agri-Marketing Association just awarded it a "Best of CAMA" award in the Merchandising Aids-Exhibits/Displays category at its annual awards banquet held recently in Winnipeg.
It was Canada's 24th consecutive year at Foodex, but the first time the new full Canada brand look and graphics – developed in partnership with industry and provinces – were incorporated into the Canada pavilion.
"It's really rewarding to get this kind of recognition," said Branding Strategy manager Sheila Barth, "especially with so many people involved.
It says a lot for the power of teamwork."
The pavilion was designed by Ottawa design company Oulton and Devine with input from Adculture and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's Events Secretariat.
(Adculture is the marketing agency that developed the original Canada brand graphics based on research in Canada's key export markets and with industry and provincial government input.)
"A ‘sense of space' is an actual key Canada brand element," said exhibit designer Peter Oulton, "so immediately the pavilion had to be open concept.
And with such a diverse group of companies in the pavilion, that was a challenge."
"Typically, the Canada pavilion has the exhibitors on the perimeter with an exclusive lounge area in the middle.
But this time, we had to incorporate everything so that all of the exhibitors were visible from all angles and the core services were easily accessible to companies," Oulton said.
"Most visitors prefer to stay on the main aisles, so we had to make it really inviting to get them to come into the pavilion."
It didn't turn out to be a problem—and having Canadian chef Wayne Murphy, in the heart of the pavilion, on hand daily to prepare Asian-style recipes using Canadian ingredients, didn't hurt.
We were able to incorporate larger graphics into the upper areas of the exhibit structure, and in the end everything really worked well," he said.
Close to 40 Canadian companies participated in Foodex, held near Tokyo, Japan, last March.
It's estimated that 2,500 exhibitors and close to 100,000 professional visitors attended the four-day annual event.

What's New Branding Canada takes to the streets and hits the news We've been diligently spreading the word about the Canada brand and the media have taken notice.
  The Montreal Gazette, with a circulation of 140,000, recently featured Canada brand members Lisa Nadeau and Gerald Martineau of La Ferme Martinette Gourmet Maple Farms in the Eastern Townships.
What's New The Canada Brand supports a winning marketing campaign in Malaysia A Canada Brand member recently won a prestigious marketing award for its product line of Halal foods.
Maple Lodge Farms captured the Halal Journal award for Most Creative Marketing for its Zabiha Halal chicken products at the World Halal Forum gala in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on May 7, 2007.
More than 1,000 people attended the gala including royalty and the country's prime minister.
A video introducing the award winners included Maple Lodge Farms saying it was proud to offer Canadian products where "Quality is in our Nature."
An ad for the Zabiha product line, located prominently on the first inside page of the magazine, also included a tasteful design using the Canada Brand graphics and tag-line.
"Maple Lodge Farms' foray into branded Halal products is an important step in capturing a portion of the global Halal food trade, estimated at $560 billion US annually," said Bruce Howard, Regional Agri-Food Trade Commissioner with the Canadian High Commission in Singapore.
"Halal food for the world's 1.6 billion Muslims must meet strict food safety and religious requirements and Maple Lodge Farms has proven itself up to this challenge.
This award furthers the message that Canada is a supplier of superior Halal products."
Anthony Tavares, CEO of Maple Lodge Farms underlined the importance of the research undertaken by his company in re-branding and expanding its Halal product line in 2004.
"We undertook extensive market research and studied demographics to better understand the needs of our Muslim customers," he said.
Maple Lodge Farms worked with retailers to make their expanded line of Halal products more widely available in mainstream grocery stores.
Consumer focus group testing helped select the striking design that won the Halal Journal award, and the Canada Brand graphics and tag-line are included in the company's international marketing material.
"We are excited by the opportunities in international markets," stated Mr. Tavares.
"Canada has a reputation for quality and we expect that using the Canada Brand will emphasize the quality of our products."
The brand will also be used in other advertising media, including on delivery vehicles in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, where Maple Lodge Farms' Zabiha products have recently appeared on store shelves.

Canada Brand Member Profile Prairie Berries www.prairieberries.com Sandra Purdy is one determined farm business owner, which clearly explains the success of Prairie Berries, a 10-acre Saskatoon berry orchard in Keeler, Saskatchewan.
It comes complete with a federally registered primary processing plant that cleans, grades, freezes and packages the nutty flavoured purplish-blue berries right on the farm.
After a few years of success, a secondary processing plant was added to perfect the company's award-winning gourmet fruit products like fruit toppings, syrups and jams, and yummy pies.
Sandra and her husband Ken first thought about producing Saskatoon berries as part of their farm diversification project back in the early 1990s.
They knew at the time that there was export potential.
The berry was unique, nutritionally valuable and had historically been a stable food source for native North American aboriginals.
But what the Purdys didn't know was how fast an international demand would emerge.
"I say I'm lucky," Sandra explains.
"The exporting really fell into our lap.
We knew that if we wanted to succeed in larger markets, we needed to produce a consistent, quality product," she says.
And then the demand started to grow.
"We started putting our company's name out on government websites…and we just started getting approached by more buyers and large importers."
The Purdys had been working as part of a co-operative grain farm with Ken's father and brother since 1982.
But Sandra had to work off the farm for financial survival.
Then, in the early 1990s, the agriculture buzz became "diversification" and she started thinking.
"My husband loves the farm and likes to work the land and produce food," she says.
"Those things are important to him.
So I knew if we wanted to stay here, we had to be creative."
And creative she was.
She homed in on the Saskatoon berry, a native Prairie berry whose nutrient composition is said to rival, if not exceed, that of the blueberry.
The Saskatoon berry is an adaptable plant that grows under a wide range of environmental conditions.
The berries apparently contain higher levels of fibre, manganese, magnesium, and protein than most other fruit.
It's a unique commodity, and, as an emerging industry, demand currently exceeds supply.
But, like most farming, it's not an endeavour for the faint of heart.
And the payback - it takes four years before a plant bears fruit and seven years before acreage is in full production - slow.
Still, the Saskatoon berry is catching on.
In 1993, 855 acres were estimated to be in production in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta.
According to Statistics Canada, Canada's international exports of jams and fruit jellies are on the rise, having increased by almost 75 per cent in value between 2003 and 2006 - from $17 million to $29 million (Cdn).
Despite their success the Purdy's aren't even considering hitting the American market at this point.
"Right now, to be a reliable supplier capable of delivering a quality product each and every time, the demand from Germany and the United Kingdom is all we can handle.
I don't dare go down to the States.
That type of smarts fits in perfectly with the philosophy behind the Canada brand program, which Prairie Berries joined as soon as Sandra heard about it in October 2006.
"This program is so in line with what we're doing and what we believe," she says.
"We believe in all the Canada brand attributes of commitment, excellence and quality, customer focus, and trustworthiness, all of which is supported by our reputation for nature and clean, wide-open spaces."
If Prairie Berries couldn't keep up with the demand for its product in the United States, "that would mean we would fail to deliver on those attributes," Sandra points out.
"And that would hurt our company brand, as well as the Canada brand.
That's a chance I won't take unless I'm convinced there's little or no risk involved in that happening."
In order to meet rising international and domestic demands, and to take the Prairie Berries brand to the next level, the Purdys do plan to expand their network of growers and invest in a centralized processing facility that has the technology and capacity to produce new products.
"We need to be innovative and creative.
‘Alberta-made' or ‘Saskatchewan-made' just doesn't cut it in the international market place.
I mean, we're one million consumers here in Saskatchewan and we can't consume all the products we make, so we'll always have to discover new markets."
"Canadian producers have to be creative and change their mind set.

What is the Canada brand?
What's in it for me?
The Brand Canada initiative, with supporting tools, can help you grow your markets and sell more products.
What's more, Canada's branding strategy was designed to be flexible and can be adapted to various markets and sectors.
Ultimately, branding Canada offers us an opportunity to grow our markets and sell more products.
In turn, as your products are successful in the market place, you add value to the Canada brand.
What's in it for the sector?
Many advantages, including a stronger international presence and opportunities for growth.
To put it in perspective, last year, Canada exported over $30 billion (Cdn) worth of food and agriculture around the world.
Almost half of Canadian domestic food and agricultural production is exported either directly as primary products or indirectly as part of processed products.
Yet in any one market, Canada's presence is small!
Countries with lower production costs and longer growing seasons are bringing more bulk commodities to market at lower prices – and making it hard for Canada to compete on price in traditional areas of strength.
But while the number of suppliers on world markets is increasing, so too, are the number of potential customers.
Those customers are demanding food that is safe and produced in an environmentally responsible way.
Customers, faced with an abundance of competing product information often make decisions based on general impressions.
So we took that positive image to develop a comprehensive brand to help Canadian exporters and marketers set Canadian products apart from the competition.
Branding Canada in international markets has a key role to play in the future of Canada's food and agriculture sector.
As soon as anyone sees or hears of a Canadian food or agricultural product, we want them to instinctively decide that the product will meet or exceed their expectations.
▪ What's in it for the sector? ▪ What's in it for me? ▪ The Canada brand promise ▪ Market research results ▪ Canada brand core attributes password protected Why?
Because it's from Canada.
The Canada brand is our image and reputation.
It's what customers can expect to experience, every time they deal with us.
We want them to think that: ▪ our products are excellent ▪ as a multi-cultural country we focus on customers and respond to the needs of our international clients ▪ as an industry, we are committed to continuous improvements Successful organizations that have developed a strong brand know who they are and why they are relevant to their customers.
How they look, what they do, the way they sound and how they promote themselves are all consistent with the way they want to be perceived in the market place.
And, what they stand for is captured in a brand promise with core attributes that they want to be known for.
We invite you to incorporate and adapt the Canada brand promise to your particular business.
Branding Canada's food and agriculture sector is a commitment by industry and government to excellence and quality.
Once we make that commitment and live up to it, the Canada brand will flourish and everyone will benefit.

PREFACE This document is intended for all bio-food industry stakeholders in Canada.
We hope it will contribute to a better understanding of the economic impact that the industry and its activity have at the national and international levels.
We would like to thank Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada for supporting this project, Andréanne Léger for her writing assistance, Jean Nolet for his work on the primary data, David Beaulieu of the Manufacturing, Construction and Energy Division, Statistics Canada, for kindly providing all the special output statistics needed for this study and, especially, Ronald Rioux of the Input–Output Division of Statistics Canada for his invaluable co-operation.
Raymond Dupuis Economist and Senior Analyst Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and Maurice Doyon Professor Laval University
We have moved beyond the term agriculture industry to agri-food industry to include food and beverage processing and marine products, while the boundaries are broadened even further with the use of the term bio-food industry to reflect all of the new bioproducts being produced, such as nutraceuticals and functional foods.
The first part of the study is aimed at measuring the impact of the newly defined bio-food industry on employment and economic activity (GDP).
This impact is the result or the contribution of final demand for bio-food products, based on the aforementioned definition, with respect to the economy as a whole.
In 2002, the bio-food industry represented $170 billion in expenditures for Canada as a whole, resulting in a $113 billion contribution to GDP (12% of Canada’s total GDP) and 2.8 million jobs annually (16% of all Canadian jobs).
The second part of the study looks at the commercial impact of bio-food industry activity in terms of GDP alone (value-added of exports to GDP), rather than the measurement commonly used (nominal value of exports to GDP), which creates bias.
The technique developed in the course of the study measures the proportion of jobs and economic activity directly related to external trade (international and interprovincial sales).
It was found that for Canada as a whole (international sales only), bio-food exports account for 20% of bio-food GDP and 18% of jobs in the industry.
Measuring the Size of the Industry III.
Brief Literature Review of Economic Spinoffs IV.
Economic Impact
• Canada Atlantic Provinces Quebec Ontario Prairies and Northwest Territories British Columbia and Yukon
Based on the study’s findings, it can be concluded that the bio-food industry plays a key role in the Canadian economy as a whole and in the country’s regions, in terms of both value-added or GDP and jobs.
Interestingly, the bio-food industry is proportionally more labour intensive than the rest of the economy as its percentage of jobs is always above that of the GDP.
The study’s findings also demonstrate the importance of external trade (interprovincial and international) for the Canadian bio-food economy.
In some regions, over half of the bio-food industry’s vitality depends on exports outside those regions.
Accordingly, efforts made by the private and public sector in this regard must be maintained, or even increased.
DEFINITION OF THE BIO-FOOD INDUSTRY
As a result of significant progress made in the biotechnology field in the last two decades, the lines between the agri-food sector and the pharmaceutical and biochemical sectors, among others, have become blurred.
There are also functional foods and nutraceuticals, which have more than just dietary characteristics.
In this context, traditional methods cannot adequately measure the agriculture industry's economic contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP).
Recent developments, particularly in the biotechnology field, require a broader definition of the agri-food industry to take this new reality into account.
We would therefore like to propose the following definition of the bio-food industry:
A life sciences industry that includes all products of plant or animal (non-human) origin that have been cultivated, grown or harvested, and all foods and beverages of non-living origin that have been processed only once, and the services related to this industry, excluding the forest industry.
This paper is divided into two sections.
The first section measures the economic impact that this newly defined bio-food industry has on jobs and economic activity (GDP).
A new method is used to measure this contribution more accurately.
This method is also used to evaluate the impact of interprovincial trade.
MEASURING THE SIZE OF THE INDUSTRY
The approach we have taken is not perfect.
Rather, it is a first attempt to develop a broader measurement of the agriculture and agri-food industry, renamed the bio-food industry, in order to take the circumstances of the early 21st century into account.
Since the data gathered did not take the new "bio-food industry" concept into account, figures had to be taken from a number of sources and certain simplifications and assumptions had to be made.
Below is a description of the methodology used.
For the other elements of the final demand, we defined the elements of the bio-food industry's intermediate demand.
For example, the total final demand of the food processing industry was used, whereas the intermediate demand of the bio-food industry is not linked to the entire pharmaceutical industry.
We then established a correlation between a complete list of bio-food industry commodities and those used by the I–O model by creating a correlation file between matrix 14 of the I–O model and Harmonized System (HS) codes1.
Each of the goods was classified in one of the categories included in our definition of the bio-food industry.
Bio-Food Industry PRIMARY (Farming, Fishing)
Pharmaceutical Industry Chemical Industry Equipment Industry Clothing Industry
SECONDARY (Processing)
A large number of components in our simulations were intermediate elements.
This meant that they were used as final demand inputs by an industry.
However, to grasp the economic impact of a sector across its industry network, we had to simulate an expenditure characterized by a final demand.
The next section provides a more detailed explanation of how input–output models work.
As previously mentioned, we used a hybrid model consisting of final demands (13 full final demands were used) and intermediate products (116 were used) that were found up to a certain point in the final demands.
All of the 116 intermediate products were found in 9 other final demands.
However, these nine demands also contained products other than bio-food industry products.
This approach is based on the assumption that input–output relationships that apply to a final demand can also be applied to a subset of that demand, that is, the disaggregated demand2.
Simulations on exports were handled as followed:
• For the 116 intermediate products, we took 100% export data;
• For nine goods that came from special Industry Division simulations, the rule of three was used: the relative weight of the goods was multiplied by the full value of exports in the I–O matrix code.
Bio-food industry I–O simulations were generated for five regions of Canada and for Canada as a whole.
Thus, Industry Division data on the Atlantic provinces were compiled on the basis of use rather than production.
Classification Examples
• Seaweed harvested for food or industrial uses are included
• Blood, proteins and human hormones are excluded
• Salt (non-living, food) is included
Single-processed products
• Wool is included, but not garment manufacturing
• Ethanol is included, except when it is added to gasoline
Related Services
• Agriculture-related services
• Transportation, distribution (of these products only)
Other
This impact is provided for Canada as a whole and then for each of the five major regions using 1996 input–output linkages, the most recent data available at the time of the study, and 2001 taxation and incidental taxation.
To update the data, estimates for 2002 were made using recent GDP data from the Conference Board of Canada.
These data include the agri-food GDP compiled by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.
The literature divides the economic impacts into three elements4: 1.
Direct effects: when part of the sector’s initial demand directly contributes to the use of factors of production, such as labour and capital.
Indirect effects: the economic effects or impact on input suppliers.
In other words, the effects of income respending by those who receive it.
These models are based on the structure of interindustrial linkages.
Input–output models work with expenditures, so the downstream impact of various sectors cannot be evaluated.
In other words, I–O models allow us to measure direct and indirect effects, but not induced effects5.
In the case of this study, simulating a shock on final demand allowed us to measure all the direct and indirect economic impacts of the bio-food industry.
The addition of wages and other income constitutes what we call the GDP of bio-food industry activity at factor cost, or the value-added at factor cost, which equals $113 billion.
The GDP at market prices, which totals $128 billion, was obtained by adding indirect taxes and subtracting subsidies (see Table 2).
The measurement of economic impact takes into account goods and services imported by businesses and organizations operating in the biofood sector, and the chain of suppliers.
Total expenditures, which include subsidies and imports, equal $173 billion.
Net total expenditures are $170 billion and correspond to total expenditures less subsidies.
This impact ($113 billion and 2.8 million jobs) comprises direct effects, which correspond to expenditures attributable to bio-food companies themselves, and indirect effects, which correspond to expenditures incurred by bio-food companies’ suppliers and these suppliers’ suppliers.
The total impact is thus the sum of the total effects (direct and indirect).
Direct effects account for 48% of the total effects on expenditures, which means that the effects produced by other sectors of the economy that supply bio-food companies equal 52% of bio-food industry GDP.
Of the total number of jobs generated (direct and indirect) by the biofood industry, the majority (55%) are direct jobs, while 45% (1.3 million) are indirect.
The main leverage effects (multipliers) of the Canadian bio-food industry are as follows:
Direct effects account for 50% of the total effects on GDP, which means that the effects of other sectors of the economy that supply bio-food companies are also equivalent to 50% of bio-food industry GDP.
Of the total number of jobs generated (direct and indirect) by the bio-food industry, more than half (57%) are direct jobs, while 43% (122,000) are indirect.
The main leverage effects (multipliers) of the Atlantic provinces' bio-food industry are as follows:
• $14.9 billion in total expenditures results in a GDP at factor cost of $10.2 billion, or a Keynesian income multiplier of 0.7;
• a value-added of $100 in bio-food industry activity results in a value-added of $100 in other sectors of the economy (all suppliers);
• 100 jobs in the bio-food sector generate 76 additional jobs in businesses in other sectors of the economy (all suppliers).

The Regional Impact of External Trade Indicators of the national impact of exports take only international exports into account.
However, each province exports commodities both abroad and to the other provinces.
To fully grasp the importance of foreign trade at the regional level, we developed a measure of the economic impact of a province’s total foreign sales, both international and interprovincial.
It seemed reasonable to assume that the impact of interprovincial exports on a region or province would be comparable to that of exports to other countries in terms of GDP and jobs.
So, for example, whether Ontario exports are being sent to Japan or British Columbia, the results should not be affected.
Using the input–output model, we compiled data on interprovincial exports for each province and applied the same ratio to those exports as to international exports.
The outcome of this assumption and method was a table estimating the impact of total exports (both interprovincial and international) for each region.
Comparing the figures in this section, we can see that the largest proportion of interprovincial bio-food exports was in Quebec, followed by Ontario.

Computational Economics:
This file is a decomposition of the majority of the 679 intermediate demands in matrix 14 into 21,250 product groups.
We then used the codes of the Industry Division’s Standard Classification of Goods (SCG) and Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) to correlate our HS codes and the codes used by the Industry Division.
However, the level of aggregation of the data available proved to be higher than that of the HS codes.
As a result, a number of commodities could not be used for lack of data.
Such was the case of sodium benzoate, a common food additive.
The Standard Classification of Goods (SCG) is the standard used to classify goods at Statistics Canada.
It is based on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS), an international standard for designating and classifying goods.
After our data output request was submitted to the Industry Division, we obtained a crossed matrix from the input–output model displaying final demand elements by column and intermediate demand elements by row (matrix 14).
Special outputs provided by the Industry Division posed another problem.
It was possible that some elements of our special outputs were already compiled in our 13 initial final demands, which were used in full.
We asked the Industry Division for an output for a subset of this group (e.g., $10 million) and we knew that our 13 fully used final demands contributed $100 million to product group 65.
This meant that the other final demands in this product group accounted for the remaining $50 million.
We then applied the ratio 50/150=0.33 to our special output for this product group.

The Government of Canada has prepared this report based on primary and secondary sources of information.
Executive Summary World trade has increased over the last decade; however, during this time, agricultural trade has only seen modest increases.
This overall trend did not affect Canada, which experienced gains of over 92 per cent in its agri-food exports.
Even with new markets for Canadian agri-food exports, such as Mexico, exports still continued to consolidate in the United States, which absorbed over two-thirds of Canada’s agricultural shipments in 2002.
Simultaneously with this consolidation to the United States, dispersion of Canadian agri-food exports within the country and a greater breadth of goods exported helped to offset some of the ramifications of consolidation.
Over the past decade, Canada has significantly increased its exports of meat and prepared grains, vegetables, and processed cocoa products.
At the same time, small decreases in the grain trade occurred.
These overall trends have shifted Canada’s exports further to processed goods over bulk with the ratio rising from 64 per cent in 1993 to 79 per cent in 2002.
Levels of World Trade World merchandise trade over the last decade (1993-2002) averaged increases of approximately 5.4 per cent per annum.3 By 2002, total global imports exceeded $6.5 trillion (USD), up from $3.8 trillion (USD) in 1993.
The adoption of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), further integration of the European market, and continuing talks at the World Trade Organization (WTO) are noticeable examples of increased trade liberalization that have contributed to the Real GDP is calculated by holding prices constant (here the prices are for the year 1997) and then calculating real GDP for future years based on changing quantities but frozen prices.
Real GDP provides a more appropriate method for comparison between years that nullifies the effects of price inflation.
It is, however, only a tool for comparison between years.
2 All values in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise noted.
sustained increases of world merchandise trade.
The large growth rates seen in general merchandise trade, however, are not present in global agricultural trade.
In 1990, global exports of agricultural products stood at $414.6 billion (USD); by 2001, the value reached $547.5 billion (USD).
As a percentage of total trade, agricultural and agri-food products composed 12.2 per cent in 1990, but fell to only 9.1 per cent of global trade in 2001.
It can therefore be seen that while nominal levels of agricultural trade are growing, relative values are falling.
By value, the largest agri-food commodity classification traded is fish and seafood.
Meat and its derivatives are second largest.
Meat comprised approximately 8.3 per cent of global trade in 2002, up from 7.7 per cent in 1998.
Of the meat traded, beef constitutes 33.8 per cent, pork 29.0 per cent, and poultry 18.3 per cent.
This is most likely due to the substitution of pork for beef in light of the effects of the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises in Europe over this period.
The changes in the composition of demand may only be a temporary distortion and could return to pre-crisis levels once international confidence is rebuilt in bovine food security.
Global Trade Statistics (imports).
WTO.
One of the largest declines over between 1998 and 2002 was the trade in cereals.
Primarily leading this decline were rice and barely crops.
Changes in Composition of World Demand While many large and well-established products had lacklustre growth rates, some lower-profile products had significant increases in world demand.
This trend indicates that countries are shifting away from immediately exporting bulk goods and instead refining and processing the product domestically.
This raises the value added before exporting to the world market.
Global Trade Atlas
Global Markets and Competition Over the past decade, the emergence of developing countries, such as China, India, and Mexico, has lessened the influence of the traditional industrialized countries in the agri-food sector.
Of traditional Canadian export competitors, both the European Union and the United States have lost some of their relative dominance.
In 1990, European dominance of global imports amounted to over 64 per cent of world trade; by 2001, their share had dropped to only 53 per cent.
On the other hand, the Americans’ share increased.
A full examination of import and export shares is described in table 3.
Much like exports, the relative import requirements of the top industrial countries have fallen, as developing countries’ demand has outstripped developed countries’ due to both rising population levels and increased affluence.
With the exception of the United States, other industrialized economies, such as the EU and Japan, have lost considerable market influence in the agricultural import market.
Although developing countries’ shares still represent small overall levels of world agricultural trade, their increased presence on the international stage provides opportunities for new and increased export markets.
World Trade Organization
As evidenced in table 4, there have been large increases in the exporting capability of select developing countries.
Brazil, Mexico and Chile have greatly increased their presence in export markets.
As technology continues to precipitate, their production capabilities should steadily increase.
Although still small players, these countries pose significant competition to the dominance of industrialized nations in agri-food exports.
Developing countries’ rising influence is more pronounced in global agri-food export than import markets.
With greater openness to world markets, countries such as China and Mexico have demonstrated greater willingness to trade.
The growth in food demand of Asian countries is standard to any poor but highly dynamic economy.
A value of 0.1 indicates that for every ten per cent increase in income, food purchases will increase by one per cent.
The United States’ income elasticity of food is one of the lowest in the world at 0.103.
The average for Asian countries was 0.346.7 Using these numbers the increase in expenditures on food products can be calculated.
Real food expenditures in the United States were projected to increase 2.9 per cent between 1995 and 2002.
For Asia, on the other hand, real food expenditures across the region were expected to jump 18.7 per cent.
This disparity between Asia and the United States illuminates where major agri-food and seafood growth was at the end of the century.
Because of data limitations in the compilation of this index, this value was derived by taking a weighted average of available countries.
Overall nominal Canadian agri-food and seafood exports stood at $30.5 billion in 2002, up from $25.5 billion in 1997.
Between 1997 and 2002, this translates into an annual real rate of growth of 3.6 per cent.9 Canada’s nominal imports stood at $22.7 billion in 2002 and $16.4 billion in 1997.
Overall, this accounted for an annual real increase of 6.2 per cent.
Canada’s real trade balance in agri-food and seafood products, therefore, decreased by $847 million in the years 1997-2002.
Broken down by product group, the ten-year period shows considerable growth in some areas, as demonstrated in table 5.
Mitigating the overall large increases, however, was a small increase in the value of cereals exported.
What had been Canada’s main export in 1993, had stagnant performance for the next decade.
As social and legal norms changed with regards to the acceptance of tobacco products, Canada’s agricultural sector adapted.
In 1993, tobacco products and their substitutes accounted for 5.1 per cent of Canada’s agri-food and seafood exports.
Within ten years, however, this crop contracted by 76.5 per cent and accounted for less than 0.7 per cent of Canadian agri-food exports in 2002.
Given the overall large increases in the rest of the agri-food sector, overall trade was not severely affected.
Over the ten-year period, the growth of processed agricultural products over traditional primary goods drove the overall gains in agrifood exports.
Goods such as grain products and pasta, vegetable and fruit preparations, and cocoa-based commodities all saw growth greater than 200 per cent.
This shift of production from an emphasis on primary to processed goods provides Canada with an opportunity to derive greater gains from exports by profiting from the increased value added.
This shift towards increasing value added within Canada has helped to diversify Canada’s export mix.
Furthermore, processed goods are less price-sensitive than bulk goods.
The longer manufacturing process, coupled with numerous inputs, smoothes out fluctuations in weather, political changes, and raw commodity prices.
That Canada is moving in this direction should provide greater stability to the industry.
The shift to an export mix that favoured processed goods over bulk goods was only accomplished in the late 1980s for Canada.
Canada’s processed export share is lower than the global ratio but ahead of the Americans’.
Canada’s Principal Export Markets For overall agri-food and seafood trade, the United States is Canada’s largest export market.
Proximity (and thus low transportation costs), common legal and social customs, and the establishment of a free trade area have all contributed to the United States’ dominance of Canada’s exports.
In 2002, the United States increased its share of Canada’s exports, now accounting for over twothirds of agri-food and seafood trade flows out of Canada.
A detailed examination of intra-industry trade appears in the appendix.
Canada’s exports are highly concentrated in only a few countries.
By 2002, approximately 80 per cent of Canadian exports were delivered to only three countries.
When compared to 1993, when the top three countries accounted for 72 per cent, the trend towards the consolidation of exports to only a handful of countries is risky.
As witnessed with the BSE crisis of 2003, such heavy dependence on one country can have disastrous effects on selected industries.
Assessing the benefits and liabilities of the United States’ dominance of Canadian trade flows may be cause for review.
While the absolute and relative quantity of exports to the United States has been undoubtedly increasing, the composition of goods exports has also diversified.
In 1993, the top five categories of agrifood and seafood exports to the United States accounted for 58.0 per cent of the total.
This measure suggests also that, although overall trade flows are increasing to the United States, their composition is much broader and thus better protected.
Furthermore, a disaggregation of trade flows between Canada and the United States yields some interesting results.
Breaking down exports by state, there has been a shift away from the traditional markets that Canadian producers have used.
States such as Illinois and Pennsylvania have seen large increases in Canadian exports, while Massachusetts, with only 6.4 million inhabitants, comprises a disproportionately large share.
Based on the top five categories of 2-digit HS codes.
In 1993, 42.2 per cent of Canadian agri-food and seafood exports to the United States went to American border states (i.e., those states that share a land border with Canada:
Washington, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, and Alaska).
Border states comprise only 16.3 per cent of the American population.
By 2002, border states received only 29.6 per cent, indicating that there has been a greater dispersion of Canadian goods within the United States and therefore a greater alignment of goods with population centres.
Within table 7, there are notable shifts in the relevance of certain countries regarding the purchase of Canada’s agri-food and seafood exports.
Japan, for example, has remained Canada’s second most important market in spite of losing both relative market share and nominal value purchased.
This decline, however, does not necessarily indicate that Canadian agri-food exporters have done poorly in this market.
Table 9 demonstrates how Canada fared relative to foreign import demand.
In Japan’s case, their import numbers present a qualification to a cursory examination of Canada’s export shares.
Although Japan’s share of Canadian exports has decreased, Canada’s share of Japanese imports has increased.
China, to a greater extent than Japan, has lessened its relative value of imports from Canada.
Between 1993 and 2002, there were no major trading impediments; in fact, over that period China joined the WTO.
Unlike Japan, however, China’s overall economy boomed.
China’s global imports of agri-food and seafood products increased by 27 per cent between 1997 and 2002.
With one-fifth of the world’s population, China is a key export market.
The significant loss of import market share in such a large and promising market remains a challenge for Canada’s trade pattern.
Share is of Canadian exports.
The three countries with whom Canada has signed free trade agreements over the last decade are Mexico in 1994 and Chile and Israel in 1997.
The results since implementation have had dichotomous results with respect to Canadian exports.
Mexico has greatly increased its share of Canadian agri-food and seafood exports; simultaneously, Canada has increased its share of Mexican agri-food and seafood imports.
These numbers demonstrate that the implementation of NAFTA certainly did not harm the overall Canadian agri-food market.
The effects of the free trade agreements signed with Chile and Israel five years after the implementation date have yet to materialize in the agri-food sector.
In fact, Chile’s share of Canadian exports has declined.
Furthermore, between 1997 and 2002, Canada’s share of Chilean agri-food and seafood imports fell from 5.3 per cent to 3.4 per
The export of meat has changed its focus away mainly from developed European countries to developing countries in Asia.
The development of the Canadian fish and seafood export market is very similar to the meat market.

STATISTICS CANADA developing countries from around the globe.
With the eastward expansion of the European Union, increased global production of these crops will most likely occur as technology is diffused and subsidy levels change.
This will put greater competitive pressures on Canadian grain exporters.
Trends and Opportunities for Canadian Agri-Food Exports As discussed in previous sections, there are certain commodities that have experienced significant global growth over the last decade.
Some of the growth of these products, however, cannot be captured by Canadian exports because of climate patterns and growing conditions.
As demonstrated in the above table, select primary goods such as tomatoes, poultry and honey have had very high growth rates.
On the whole, however, these products had small values.
The largest dollar gains came from the prepared foods, such as bread, chocolate products, and condiments.
The increased values of seafood products exported are due primarily to increases in quantity and not increases in price.
Quantities of exported of shrimps and prawns and crab increased by 576.4 per cent and 336.7 per cent, respectively over the period.
On the list above, there are three products that have not been mentioned that are popular in the agricultural trade literature.
These three are pet food, bottled water, and wine.
These goods are popular because demand for pet food and bottled water is expected to grow rapidly while Canadian production and quality of wine, a high-value product, has increased substantially.
Pet food exports have seen sustained increases in the last decade.
It is a high-value product where year-to-year consumption is relatively stable.
Further, pet ownership in many emerging markets is growing.
Whereas global quantity exported has increased over 1993-2001 by 75.0 per cent, Canadian exports have increased 96.4 per cent.
Over the period 1993 to 2001, the value of global exports increased by 93.6 per cent, while Canadian exports rose by 227.4 per cent.
But the price that Canada can command for its water exports has been falling.
Canada’s export performance in wine has exploded in the last decade.
Unlike other agri-food products where crops can almost be changed almost yearly, the establishment of a vineyard and all the processing equipment is a long and laborious process.
In this market, Canada is still an extremely small player.
As at 2001, Canadian wine exports composed only 0.07 per cent of world wine trade.
There is, therefore, much room in the international market for Canadian vintners to expand production and export.15
FAO Statistics FAO Statistics
Intra-industry Trade Intra-industry trade is an important aspect in the trade of processed agri-food products.
Defined, it is trade between two countries in the same good.
This type of trade is the antithesis of classical economics, which saw trade occurring only because of differences in natural endowments, technology and relative skill levels of workers.
In that model, all of one commodity would be made by one country and thus only one country would export for each good.
Ricardo’s comparative advantage still holds for trade between industrialized and industrializing countries, as those indicators are anything but convergent.
For trade between industrialized countries, however, where the values of capital-to-labour, technology and resources are close, the existence of intra-industry trade, along with inter-industry trade, provides interesting analysis.
The existence of intra-industry trade can be explained primarily by economies of scale, diversity of consumer preferences and market structure.
Because of this, consumer choices can be expanded while prices simultaneously drop.
An examination of intra-industry trade necessarily excludes bulk goods in favour of processed goods.
Exploring the trade of homogenous goods (such as grain) provides little information and would primarily be based on land, climate and labour.
Therefore, processed foods are a more robust instrument.
A value of one indicates that exports perfectly equal imports and a value of zero indicates that there is only one-way trade in that product.

Note:
Items are top ten relevant categories of Canadian exports to the United States by value.
As seen in table 1517, there are considerable differences both among goods and between years.
Trade data inherently have fluctuations, though fluctuations are less with processed products compared to bulk commodities.
Overall, agri-food production is more prone to weather patterns than other industries.
The United States was therefore chosen because of their dominance in Canadian trade and their relatively similar climate, geography and tastes.
Intra-industry trade of beef had significant reductions between 1993 and 2002 as Canada’s net exports of beef rose sharply.
There were similar drops for live plants.
The data indicate that there is a general tendency away from extreme values of either perfect equality or oneway trade.
Overall, intra-industry trade appears to be rising with the United States, which benefits both producers and consumers.
The USDA (1996) suggests aggregation at the 4-digit SITC level.
For comparable data, 6-digit HS codes were used.

I. Bread and bakery product manufacturing industry In Québec, bread and bakery product manufacturing accounts for 5% of activity in the food, beverage and tobacco industry.1 Manufacturing shipments rose 8% between 1995 and 1999 and 34% between 2000 and 20012 (Table 1).
In 2001, they totalled $903.6 million, or 30% of the Canadian total, injecting $457 million in value added into the Québec economy.

Statistics Canada 31-203, CANSIM DEEAF from La transformation alimentaire québécoise en chiffres.
According to Statistics Canada, NAICS 31 181 comprises establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing bakery products, except cookies and crackers.
Establishments classified in this industry may sell to commercial or retail customers, for consumption off the premises.
For example, sweet bread, raisin bread, and pastry products such as Vachon cakes, croissants and donuts come under NAICS 31 181.
This report, however, looks solely at the fresh and frozen bread industry.
For more information, log on to: http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/canadian_industry_statistics/cis.nsf/idF/cis31 8defF.html. 1 Statistics Canada changed its annual manufacturing survey during this data interval.
The survey universe was extended to all manufacturing units beginning in the 2000 reference year.
Comparisons with prior years are therefore not possible.
Supply and markets Manufacturing production in the bread and bakery product manufacturing industry is sustained by domestic market growth (Table 2).
In fact, between 1995 and 1999, the domestic market in Québec grew by 9%.
And between 2000 and 2001, consumer demand in this market rose significantly, by more than 32%, to $879 million in 2001.
This hike was partly due to a rise in consumer demand for fresh-baked home-style specialty breads made with new ingredients such as flaxseed, and quick-frozen partially-baked (par-baked) breads.
Between 1995 and 1999, exports of bread and bakery products rose by 18%.
Exports have since seen strong growth, increasing by 1 16% between 2000 and 2002, to $54 million.
Imports, which are not as significant as exports, have remained stable, increasing from $18 million to $19 million between 2000 and 2002.
* Estimates based on Canadian apparent domestic market (manufacturing shipments + imports - exports).
Industry structure Readers should note that, from this section on, the analysis covers only the fresh and frozen bread industry.
Industrial and home-style bakeries supply the Québec market with three (3) types of products: sliced breads, quick-frozen products (for retailers’ bakery sections), and home-style breads.
In 2003, three industrial bakeries, Canada Bread Company, Limited, Weston Bakeries Québec and Boulangerie Gadoua Ltée,3 accounted for over 88%4 of fresh sliced bread sales to retailers.
These companies supply a broad range of sliced breads and/or quick-frozen products.
Increasingly, the line separating industrial and home-style bakeries is becoming blurred.
Home-style bakeries such as Boulangerie Première Moisson Inc. have automated parts of their production of home-style breads in order to increase their capacity and better position themselves to serve the superstore market.
However, most home-style bakeries are still small, have no automated facilities, and have limited distribution networks.
Changes in consumer demand Segmentation of the Québec bakery products industry continues.
Consumer demand for high-end products that "taste good and are good for you" is on the rise.
Particularly popular are soft home-style rye, oat or spelt wheat breads with added ingredients such as olives or nuts.
The ageing of the population and new Canadian regulations5 requiring more detailed nutrition labelling have contributed to the increased popularity of health food products, which in turn has led to higher production of products made with olive or soybean oil, and fat-free and sugar-free products.
In fact, the increase in popularity of breads with full grain flavour seems to be occurring at the expense of sliced white breads, known for their sweet flavour.
The introduction of sliced organic breads made from unbleached flour may also be affecting the popularity of traditional, very white, bread.
In sum, current changes seem to be leading to a loss of market share for sliced white breads.
At the same time, the variety of par-baked breads is growing to include Belgian and Parisian loaves and pesto and sourdough bread.
See Appendix for the Web addresses of the major companies operating in Québec.
Canada Bread Company, Limited (35%), Weston Bakeries Québec (24%), Gadoua (1 1%) and private brands (18%) (MAPAQ and AAC estimates, 2004).
The three companies mentioned above supply retailers for their own private brand sales.
These data exclude hamburger and hot dog buns and pita breads, and represent the market for conventional sliced breads sold fresh to major food chains and warehouse clubs other than discount stores such as Wal-Mart and Costco. http://www.inspection.gc.ca/francais/fssa/labeti/guide/prefacef.shtml. The purpose of the new regulations is to provide Canadians with specific nutritional information about products in order to help them make informed choices, eat well and manage their nutritional intake, to avoid developing certain chronic illnesses.
Implementation began on December 12, 2002, and will take between three (3) and five (5) years depending on the individual companies’ sales figures.
According to L’Actualité (February 2004): "rent" paid by a supplier to a distributor for space on the distributor’s shelves.
MAPAQ and AAC estimate, 2004.
There is also segmentation of the bakery market into breads with an ever finer, more uniform texture (associated with controlled industrial production) and breads with a heavier, much less refined texture (associated with homemade breads).
Inevitably, this trend relating to bread’s appearance is a reflection of the market, where there are different quality standards.
Retail strategies… In Québec, concentration of distribution has increased competition among food processors.
To sell to retailers, industrial processors must be able to supply large volumes deliverable on a just-in-time basis, pay slotting fees6 and contribute to product advertising.
In the Québec bread and bakery product manufacturing sector, the main players are Weston Bakeries Québec (owned by Georges Weston Ltd.), Canada Bread Company, Limited (Division of Maple Leaf Foods Inc.) and Boulangerie Gadoua Ltée, all of which have successful lines of sliced soft breads.
In 2003, the market share of private brand bakery products was estimated at 18% in Québec, compared with over 30% of the market in Ontario and western Canada.7 Given retailers’ considerable bargaining power, Canada Bread Company, Limited, in which Maple Leaf Foods Inc. has a majority interest, offsets the power relationships by offering a variety of products ranging from meats to pastas, through its parent company.
Canada Bread Company, Limited, which has held a 100% interest in Multi-Marques Inc. since 2001, sells its fresh and quick-frozen bakery products under several brand names, including Dempster’s and POM.
In 2003, the company introduced a new line of Dempster’s products, with a longer shelf life, in Ontario and western Canada.
This company also sells French-type products in corner stores and the bakery sections of food retailers through its subsidiary Maison Cousin Inc.
The Tendre Moitié bread introduced as part of the Country Harvest line won the Canadian Grand Prix New Product Award, Bakery category, in 2001.
Weston Foods subsidiary Ready Bake Foods Inc. also sells quick-frozen products to the bakery sections of food retailers.
As for the major Québec players, Boulangerie Gadoua Ltée is mainly active at the provincial level and produces a range of sliced soft breads.
Première Moisson Inc. is now operating on an industrial scale, delivering home-style breads to retailers.
Boulangerie St-Méthode Inc. has been selling its products to Co-op Atlantic retailers in eastern Canada since 2001 and has gained a reputation for its sliced fat-free, sugar-free organic breads.
In fact, Boulangerie St-Méthode Inc. won the 2004 Prize for Innovation awarded by the Council of Food Processing and Consumer Products (CTAC), for its seven Naturo-Bio organic breads.
...breaking into the health food market… To address health concerns fostered by an ageing population, Weston Bakeries Québec now sells soybean-based bread, flaxseed bread rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, and fat-free and sugar-free breads.
Boulangerie Gadoua Ltée has introduced the Gustazzi line of breads, comprising seven varieties of olive-oil based bread, such as ciabatta, sesame seed bread, and herb and spice hamburger buns.
Organic breads are also in demand.
Boulangerie St-Méthode Inc., among others, sells a range of organic products (Naturo-Bio, which bear the Bio-Écocert certification) across Québec.
In early 2004, Multi-Marques Inc.
(Canada Bread Company, Limited) introduced three Healthy Way organic breads under the Bon Matin brand name, also bearing the Bio-Écocert certification.
…and the frozen par-baked bread market The fresh and quick-frozen par-baked bread market is experiencing strong growth.
Supermarket bakery sections are profitable, as the smell of warm bread prompts impulse buying.
The flexibility this product affords grocery store operators, with its quick preparation time and assurance of constant quality, is another point in its favour.
The variety of par-baked bread is expanding to include products with enhanced flavour, such as herb breads, and breads made with Kamut, rye or spelt wheat flour.
Bakeries are even selling par-baked bread products, ranging from croissants to French baguettes, for consumers to bake at home.
Home-style bakeries Québec Bakery Industry Outlook April 2004 Home-style bakeries, most of which are small, are very successful because they sell high-quality, healthful products such as focaccia and ciabatta breads and breads made from new ingredients such as flaxseed.

Canada Bread Company, Limited and Weston Bakeries Québec also serve the fresh and quick-frozen par-baked bread sector of the food services industry, as does Les Produits Bridor Inc., owned by the French group, LeDuff, selling a variety of quick-frozen par-baked products ranging from croissants to specialty breads such as pesto and olive breads.
The trend toward healthful eating has also led to more varieties of breads being supplied to the food services industry.
For example, in early 2004, Subway launched a new line of low-carbohydrate wraps.
… and North American presence Weston Foods and Canada Bread Company, Limited have operations across North America, where the bakery industry is concentrated.
Investments Manufacturing… Weston Foods is now the third largest processor in the US bakery industry as a result of its acquisition of Bestfoods Baking Co. in 2001 ($2.7 billion), its investment of several million dollars in the production facilities, and restructuring involving the sale of Bestfoods Baking Co.’s western US operations in 2002 ($950 million).
In 2003, Weston Foods reported sales of $4,523 billion12 despite the closure of a number of US plants.
In 2004, in the US, Weston Foods will be building three plants, which will go into operation the following year, and will be closing four plants not deemed efficient.13
Canada Bread Company, Limited is growing: between 2001 and 2002, its sales rose by 51%, to over $1 billion.14 During that time, the company made a number of acquisitions.
In 2001 and 2002, Canada Bread Company, Limited expanded its operations in Canada by acquiring 75% of the residual shares in Multi-Marques Inc. in Québec (thus Maison Cousin Inc.) and 40% of the residual shares in Ben’s Limited in the Maritimes and Olafson’s ($1 million), which 1.5 specializes in value added products, in British Columbia.
It also expanded internationally by acquiring shares in Maple Leaf Foods Inc.’s bakery products group in the US and the UK and the American Grace Baking Company, which specializes in fresh and quick-frozen home-style breads (for a total of $262 million).
Maple Leaf Foods Inc. also acquired additional shares in Canada Bread Company, Limited, giving it an 85% interest in that company.
A second $1.5 million investment phase is slated for completion in 2004.
The company also plans to expand outside Québec using a new micro-shop concept.
Boulangerie Gadoua Ltée is investing $5 million in a new manufacturing and distribution centre in Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures,17 while Les Produits Bridor Inc. has initiated implementation of IFS software, which facilitates supply system and client management.

V. Challenges and opportunities for growth 1.
Innovation through new products… Developing quick-frozen par-baked home-style breads will be a challenge taken up by many companies.
Moreover, this range of products eases the problem of the growing lack of experienced labour in the bakery sector.
The niche of fresh high-end home-style breads such as focaccia and ciabatta also seems quite promising.
For this type of product, industrial bakeries and larger home-style bakeries such as Première Moisson Inc. have the challenge of working with less standardized ingredients, yet ensuring a uniform finished product.
The strength of small home-style bakeries is the fact that they sell unique products that are anything but uniform.
The use of organic flour and Québec wheat flour also seems quite promising.
…including products that address health concerns The Atkins diet trend, which encourages high protein, low carbohydrate intake, is well established in the United States despite criticism by the American Medical Association and the American Heart Association.
Its huge popularity has had a negative effect on consumption of flour-based products in the US in recent years.
Weston Bakeries Québec and Canada Bread Company, Limited have accordingly launched new Atkins products in the United States and/or English Canada.
And other health-related variations are appearing on the American market, such as high-calcium, low-sodium, and sugar-free breads.
So far, unlike the Montignac diet method, which promotes organic stoneground whole wheat products, the Atkins diet has not gained popularity in Québec, the negative press having quickly spread.
It seems that health food product offerings will have to meet the ever more demanding requirements of Québec consumers and ever more structured criticism of the food press.
In fact, it seems that a mere reference to "organic" or "fat-free" no longer suffices.
It is therefore quite likely that certification aimed at reassuring consumers about the beneficial effects of products will become more and more popular.
Breads from the Boulangerie St-Méthode Inc. already carry quality seals, such as the Garantie Bio-Écocert for its Naturo-Bio organic product line, as well as certification by the Canadian Diabetes Association and the Heart and Stroke Foundation for its olive oil breads.
Functional bakery products also seem promising in English Canada.
In 2004, Shasha Bread, which operates in Ontario, intends to launch a line of functional products to address the separate nutritional needs of men and women.
Similarly, Wellness Bread, based in Ontario and British Columbia, sells a line of bakery products containing inulin, a non-soluble dietary fibre.
This ingredient is a type of carbohydrate that acts as a fermentable substrate for intestinal microflora following digestion.
Although inulin is often used in European bakery products, whether it will gain favour in Québec remains to be seen.
Promotion of benefits of bakery products Québec Bakery Industry Outlook April 2004 While health products are popular, the Québec bakery industry would do well to promote the health benefits of its products.
Providing consumers with easy-to-understand nutritional information on bakery products, through nutrition facts tables for example, including information on trans-fats, sugar and good and bad carbohydrates, is especially important.
"Pains Healthy Way," Le Soleil, January 17 2004.
Small bakeries21 Given the concentration of food distribution and the competition from three major bakery companies, smaller bakeries with 50 to 100 employees are faced with the challenge of finding a place for their products on food-chain store shelves.
These businesses have the advantage of operating in niche markets and being able to quickly adapt to market trends as a result of their direct contact with their clients.
However, access to food retailers remains very difficult because of their advertising requirements and the volume of goods they require.
To ensure their survival over the coming years, smaller bakeries will have to look at ways of increasing their influence of this market, whether through mergers or through grouped distribution.
Further export growth… Québec’s domestic market saw a 32% growth in sales between 2000 and 2001, but judging from the remarkable rise in exports (1 16%) between 2000 and 2002, there is huge potential for export growth.
Most Québec exports go to the United States.
Extending the range of quick-frozen par-baked home-style breads and diversifying clientele should make it possible to achieve further export growth.
…and expansion across North America Weston Foods and Canada Bread Company, Limited, operating in Canada and the United States, are facing the challenge of achieving further growth in a context of industry concentration in North America, while responding to requirements and expectations that are uniquely Canadian or even specific to Québec alone.
At this stage, Weston Foods is seeking to increase its US market share with Costco and Wal-Mart, which compete directly with Loblaw Companies Ltd. in Canada.
This would enable it to maintain the momentum it achieved in 2002, when its volume of US sales rose slightly while that of its competitors stagnated.
The scale of the knowledge transfer could be extended, while the company’s expertise in specialty breads in the United Kingdom could be used on the Canadian market.
Also, although Canada Bread Company, Limited is the North American leader in frozen par-baked breads, it is prepared for the challenge of growing its sales.
In fact, the company estimates that this market has so far reached only 25% of its full potential.22
Conclusion In sum, several factors will force companies to make rational choices in the development of new products: 1 New Canadian regulations respecting nutrition labelling; 2 Consumer demands related to health concerns; 3 Scientific studies on the damaging effects of trans-fats and sugar and the benefits of fibre, Omega-3s, and olive oil; and 4 The increasing number of certifications available (Bio-Écocert and Canadian Diabetes Association and Heart and Stroke Foundation (Health Check) certification).
Given this context, companies will need to be flexible, to be able to adapt more quickly to new trends while continuing to offer high-quality products.
And, from a sector-based perspective, it will be helpful to generically promote the health benefits of bakery products, in the same way that pork and its low fat content were promoted in the early 1990s (pork can be peeled of its fat in the same way one peels a banana).

Quarterly Pork Report January- March 2006 Manitoba Regional Office Issue #29 March, 2006
World Market Overview The forecast estimates for 2006 world pork production indicate an increase of 3% to 97.2 million tonnes.
Pork exports by major traders are estimated at 5.1 million tonnes for 2006 compared to 5.0 million tonnes in 2005.
Production gains by the Chinese, EU and the U.S. are being forecasted to be consumed domestically resulting in the relatively flat trading levels.
China continues to dominate estimated pork production accounting for 53.5% at 52 million tonnes.
Chinese exports of pork are expected to drop to 300,000 metric tonnes in 2006 compared to 331,000 in 2005 due to strong domestic demand and the fears of Avian Influenza (AI).
EU pork production for 2006 is estimated at 21.5 million tonnes compared to 21.2 million tonnes for 2005.
The gains in production are being attributed to industry gains in Germany and Poland.
Lower feed costs and AI have contributed to the increase in the supply for pork in Europe.
EU pork exports to Japan are expected to drop due to the lack of price competitiveness in relation to low U.S. pork prices.
This expected export shortfall could be made up with increased exports to Russia resulting in no significant change in EU pork exports.
U.S. forecasted 2006 pork production figure is 9,632,000 tonnes a slight increase over the 2005 figure of 9,392,000 tonnes.
Exports of U.S. pork are expected to be around 1.3 million tonnes accounting for 12.9% of estimated production.
The value of the U.S. dollar is making U.S. pork attractive to overseas buyers.
Canadian pork production is expected to drop slightly from 1,915,000 tonnes in 2005 to 1,910,000 metric for 2006.
Canadian 2006 pork export estimates show an increase over 2% to 1,110,000 tonnes.
With exports over 1.0 million tonnes, the ever-rising export volumes mean that the domestic consumption market will have less of an impact on Canadian pork production levels.
Canadian importation of pork is expected to increase over 15% in 2006.

World Markets and Trade, March 2006
Over production of live hogs and a fall in pork demand continue to depress hog prices.
Feed prices have remained stable, but overproduction has resulted in lower hog prices.
Farmers have been retaining hogs and increasing the weight of hogs held as inventory.
Those farmers unable to cope with rising costs will undersell their inventories adding further pressure to hog prices.
The numbers of large commercial farms have been steadily increasing resulting in better production efficiencies.
About 70 percent of China’s pigs are still raised in backyard farms where it is difficult to coordinate and monitor production.
Excess low cost pork supplies may flow into the pork export markets.
Importers of pork products will feel the pain of China’s excess supply in the form of reduced import quotas.
Importers would benefit from excess supplies but, low import quotas may prevent them from seizing the opportunity.

Contaminated feed has been blamed for the illegal dioxin levels.
The suspension has damaged the EU’s food safety image, and has opened up opportunities for competitors in the China and Asian markets.
European Union According to the Foreign Agricultural Service, pig production is forecast to increase compared to 2005.
Swine exports are expected to remain at a high level.
EU pig slaughter is forecast to increase by about one percent in 2006, with the main increases expected in Germany, Poland, Portugal and Spain.
Slaughter decreases are expected in France, Italy, the Czech Republic and Hungary.
Hungarian producers are planning to build a new slaughter house with the capacity of 1.5 million head.
USDA Foreign Agricultural Service EU Offices
A recent finding of illegal levels of dioxins in the Netherlands, Germany, and Belgium had resulted in the quarantine of over 600 hundred farms and the suspension of pork exports to China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan.
The dioxins were traced to a Dutch animal feed mill.
More recently, there have been reports of Swine Fever outbreaks in North Rhine Westfalia Germany.
These events could have a significant impact on the future production and export of pork from Western Europe.
EU pork imports are forecasted to decrease with increasing domestic production.
EU pork exports to Russia will increase as a result of Russia decreasing imports from Brazil due to FMD situation and the ban on Polish meat and plant products in mid-November 2005.
In the beginning of 2006, French pork exporters have launched several promotional activities in Japan with the goal of increasing French pork exports to 25,000 MT annually.
Keen competition will come from 4 5
United States Pork production forecasts for Q1 of 2006 remain unchanged.
Q1 prices of live equivalent 51-52 percent lean hogs are expected to average between $42 and $43 per cwt.
U.S. pork exports for January 2006 were more than 20 percent larger than January 2005.
Mexico, Russia and South Korea were strong markets for U.S. pork.
Exports to Japan in 2006 are expected to slow after Japan imported a large number of U.S. pork products in 2005 resulting in a surplus in the Japanese market for 2006.
Higher U.S. pork exports in 2006 will be largely attributable to attractive U.S. pork prices and to a fairly sharp drop-off in the value of the U.S. dollar, making prices to customers even more attractive.
US Hog Inventories U.S. hog producers intend to have 2.88 million sows farrowing in the December 2005 to February 2006 quarter, up one percent from the actual farrowings during the same period in both 2005 and 2004.
Intended farrowings for March to May 2006, at 2.89 million sows, are up slightly from 2005 and up one percent from 2004.

The heavy weights have been attributed to ideal growing conditions in the Corn Belt.
Hog slaughter in February 2006 dropped off to just over 8 million head (figure 1), with live weights coming in at 272 pounds per head (figure 2).
Slaughter figures for March should improve to about 9 million head.
National Agricultural Statistics Service
Market analysts are showing concern about domestic pork demand as attractively priced poultry abounds.
The key market dynamic of the past 2 years has been the extraordinary jump in hog prices that began in the first half of 2004, and the subsequent price reduction from August 2004 through January 2006.
USDA’s 2006 hog price forecast ranges (Table 10) between $42 to $45 per cwt, for 51 – 52 percent lean, live equivalent hogs; anticipates above break-even prices for most producers this year.

U.S. pork imports at 86.4 million pounds in January 2006 were about 2.5 percent higher than January of 2005.
Eighty percent of January imports were of Canadian origin, 11 percent came from Denmark, with the balance coming from other EU nations, mainly the Netherlands and Poland.
U.S. buyers imported 719,881 head of Canadian swine into the U.S. in January, more than 7 percent above January 2005 imports.
The feeder pig component of January imports was 67 6 percent, versus 65 percent last year.
The U.S. is expected to import 8.6 million head of Canadian swine this year, about 68 percent of which are expected to be feeder/weanling/isoweanling animals.
Canada Canadian Hog Inventories Table 11 shows that Manitoba’s inventories continue to grow despite a declining total inventory for all of Canada.
Ontario figures may continue to decline due to high mortality rates (10 to 12 percent) from PCVII (Porcine circovirus).
Since the end of 2004, the virus has become more problematic as PCVII had been confined to hogs 6 to 10 weeks old; however the virus is now showing up in hogs aged 10 to 15 weeks.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange released a report that the Canadian swine breeding herd had a negative year-over-year number.
The herd was estimated to be down only 0.2 percent in January and marks the first quarter since April 1996 that the Canadian breeding herd was smaller than the one earlier.
Farrowing intentions are expected to raise levels for 2006 producing pig crop numbers close to 2005 levels.

Canadian Exports The actual numbers of live hogs exported in 2005 are down compared to 2004.
Conversely, the value of the shipments has risen along with Canadian dollar.
This trend is expected to continue and stabilize during 2006 when the Canadian dollar is forecasted to peak at 90 cents USD.
The hog price forecast (table 16) indicates that prices for producers could be higher in Q3 and remain stable throughout Q4.

Canadian hog producers will be looking to Ottawa regarding the U.S. corn tariff and the impact it will have on the hog producing industry in Canada.
Canadian corn producers say U.S. corn is unfairly subsidized and sold below cost into Canada.
Preliminary duties of $1.65 USD per bushel are currently being assessed.
These duties could become permanent if the Canadian International Trade Tribunal finds the imports injure the Canadian corn industry.
A ruling on that is expected this spring.
The duties automatically make livestock feed more expensive.
Hog producers say their average costs have risen by $20 an animal.
The Canadian pork industry broke export records in 2005, shipping 1.029 million tonnes valued at $2.84 billion Canadian.
Canada has successfully diversified its export markets while sales to the U.S. have been in decline over the past few years and now represent less than 40 percent of Canada’s pork exports.
Japan remains Canada’s second largest customer acquiring 266,000 tonnes of pork at a cost of $1.01 billion, a rise of 30 per cent in both volume and dollar amount.
Australia continues to be the third largest market, buying 35,000 tonnes in 2005, for $126 million.
South Korea, Mexico, China/Hong Kong and Romania were also strong markets for Canadian pork, with purchases valued at over $50 million for each country.
South Korean imports leaped 80 per cent over 2004 totals, to 60,000 tonnes and a staggering 133 per cent in value to $100 million.
Sales to Mexico declined slightly to 63,000 tonnes totalling $88 million.
Exports to China/Hong Kong amounted to 53,000 tonnes and $64 million, while those to Romania rose considerably in 2005 to reach 28,000 tonnes and $57 million.

News Headlines South Korea to promote premium quality meat SOUTH KOREA - The South Korean government said today (10 February) that it will help local livestock producers compete with cheap imports by designating 80 beef and pork brands as premium quality.
The move is an attempt to prepare the South Korean agricultural sector for increased competition that would arise from foreign imports if the World Trade Organisation were to approve its Doha round talks and the US free trade agreement were to go through.
The WTO has already declared the 5 year old law illegal.
Foot-and-mouth disease hits Argentina ARGENTINA - Argentina has discovered a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in its northern Corrientes province, prompting neighboring South American countries to tighten border controls.
Jorge Amaya, head of the Argentine National Service for Food Safety and Quality, confirmed Wednesday that they had found 70 animals with foot-and-mouth disease in the town of San Luis del Palmar, Corrientes, some 960 km northeast of Buenos Aires.
Since the outbreak was detected on Saturday, Argentine authorities have cordoned off a 20-km area and ordered the slaughter of more than 3,000 animals in Corrientes, which borders Uruguay and Brazil.
Amaya said Argentina had officially reported the outbreak to the World Organization for Animal Health and health officials of the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), which groups Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, with Chile and Bolivia as associate states.
CLIA to release draft traceability documents Canada - The Canadian Livestock Identification Agency is preparing to circulate to its members, for feedback, three draft documents which outline the structure and operation of a proposed a national multi-species traceability system in Canada.
Hog slaughter continues to run above expectations US Weekly Hog Outlook, 3rd February 2006 - Weekly review of the US hog industry, written by Glenn Grimes and Ron Plain.
The last four weeks slaughter has been about 3% above a year earlier based on preliminary data.
On top of the 3% increase in number slaughtered weights have averaged about 1.5% heavier than 12 months earlier.
We have been extremely concerned about the demand for live hogs so far this year.
However, when one considers we have produced around 4.5% more pork in the past four weeks, with the extremely inelastic demand we have had for the past 10 years, we can explain most of the weakness in hog prices to supply.
Manitoba Agriculture Food and Rural Initiatives has on its web site production economics (cost of production information), livestock sector profiles, trade information and the Weekly Market Report.
Very useful information for both the generalist as well as the specialist!

Quarterly Pork Report April- June 2006 Manitoba Regional Office Issue #30 June, 2006
World Market Overview China and South East Asia In China, domestic pork production remains stagnant as Hog inventories have dropped slightly.
This has resulted in marginally positive price movements for live hog and piglet prices for the month of June.
Central Vietnam’s Quang Nam province is dealing with a foot-and- mouth disease epidemic, with 52 outbreak zones.
Hong Kong plans to cease pig farming permanently under a 941.7 million HK dollar (121 million US) scheme so as to improve the sanitary situation.
China is the current leading pork importer for the Hong Kong area.
European Union The 2005 statistics for pork production and pig populations were released in June.
Lower labour costs have been attributed to the growth of the pig populations in the New Member States, especially in Poland and Hungary.
Pig-meat prices in the EU 15 have reached the highest levels since 2003 during the month of June.
Despite reductions in pork exports to Japan in April, pork exports for 2006 are expected to be $1.026 billion or 16% above 2005 totals.
A weaker US dollar continues to spur US pork exports.
The Economic Research Service estimated returns for a farrow-to-finish operation in the North Central United States currently show break-even costs in the high $30 per cwt, suggesting that most US hog producers continue to operate with positive margins.
In Canada, May hog prices were down 10% versus last year.
Hog supplies have recently dwindled as more market hogs have been going south.
Disease may have also contributed to the reduced supply especially in Ontario.
Canadian pork exports are experiencing strong volumes however; competitive pricing has brought returns down.
China In the near term, higher temperatures across China may slow the process of hog fattening and make piglets more susceptible to diseases.
This, coupled with continued torrential rain in the south as well as wheat harvesting in the north, will affect farmers’ interest in replenishing pig inventories.
Despite some improvement in market sentiments, there is only marginal increase in piglet transactions as most farmers were still cash-strapped after earlier losses.
Higher feed costs and profit concerns had also led some farmers to remain cautious.
Better poultry prices had also prompted some farmers to give up on hog farming, opting to raise poultry instead.

With currently reduced live hog inventories in China this quarter, hog prices in southern regions have only made marginal gains.
European Union Pig-meat prices in the six largest EU15 producers have broken the 107p/kg barrier for the first time since 2001.
Traders are quoting low stocks and high demand, boosted by sizzling temperatures and an influx of visitors to Germany for the World Cup as the main reasons for the strong market.
German farmers are now receiving average prices of 115p/kg for heavy carcasses between 85 – 90kg deadweight.
These prices are the highest in Europe with the exception of Italian Parma ham production.
The latest GB Deadweight Adjusted Pig Price stands well behind comparable EU prices at 103.2p. Supply restrictions following foot-and-mouth outbreaks in Brazil have increased Russian demand for pig-meat.
The latest statistics for European Pig Populations (see figure 1) indicate that the new member states enjoyed a 3% growth rate with Poland’s population at over 18 million pigs.
The total pig population for the new member states is estimated at just over 29 million compared to the EU15’s 123 million pigs.

United States Commercial pork production for the 2nd quarter is estimated at 5.1 billion pounds.
Strong foreign demand and a weaker US dollar have resulted in increase US pork exports.
Although prices for both retail pork and hogs are expected to be lower both this year and in 2007, the price spread between hog prices and retail pork prices will likely increase.
This means the gross returns to packer\processors\wholesalers will probably be higher than 2005.

Manitoba OlyWest continues to move forward with its plans for a new processing plant in Winnipeg.
After surviving a city of Winnipeg council vote on the location and funding of the project, OlyWest has moved on to hosting open house meetings for the public.
OlyWest still needs to submit its plan for provincial environmental review before construction can begin in 2007.
The total processed pork in Manitoba is down 23.6% while the total number of hogs slaughtered is also down 8% over the same period last year.
The Canadian dollar and high processing costs have made pork exports less attractive.

South Korea Pork Price touches record high in June Korea – The price of pork in South Korea touched a record high in the month of June, the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation said.
Average price for a carcass weighing 100 kilograms reached 320,000 won or US$332.80 in June, higher than the previous record of 298,000 won recorded a year earlier.
The prices were driven by strong seasonal demand and a supply shortage.
World Pork Expo Report DES MOINES IOWA
• Industry continues to consolidate.
• There was talk that some of the pork powerhouses are actively pursuing building and owning their own finishing sites.
Perceived lack of control of contract finishers was cited as the main driver in this direction.
• Canadian producers were investigating the merits of finishing their pigs in the US.
It has suggested that there is approximately $22-24 per head advantage with US finishing.
• Current Hog supply in the US is tight.
Expect marketing’s of 1,850 – 1,900 million a week until July.
Hog prices will remain in the 70’s.
• There has been some concern about future feed prices rising as Ethanol production increases.
• PWMS and/or Circovirus were a major topic of conversation.
There has been some speculation that these diseases will account for a 1 to 2% decline in US hog production.
Beef and Poultry Glut Appears to be Easing CANADA - An official with Ontario Pork says it appears a glut of beef and poultry in cold storage that's been pressuring meat prices has started to ease.
Key factors expected to affect live hog prices in the coming months include demand for pork during barbecue season, US slaughter numbers, and the volume of meat in cold storage.
Ontario Pork sales team manager Patrick O'Neil says there's been an increase in frozen stocks of both poultry and beef.
"Definitely there's been an increase in frozen stocks of both poultry and beef supplies.
However, he points out, in the last two months we've seen wholesale pork prices increase about 15 dollars per hundredweight US which means pork continues to move at good prices despite the increased competition from beef and poultry.
Moose Jaw Pork Packers started killing hogs June 12th CANADA – The plan is to kill approximately 300 per day for the first few weeks.

Quarterly Pork Report October - December 2006 Manitoba Regional Office Issue #32 December, 2006
World Market Overview China The USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) forecasts China’s pork production in 2007 will reach a record high of 55.8 million metric tonnes (MMT) a 5% increase from the estimated 52 MMT in 20061.
During 2006, China’s wholesale swine prices decreased 27 and 26 percent when compared to prices in 2005 and 2004.
This drop has been linked to high grain wholesale prices.
It is estimated by FAS that the average farmer has been losing $10 USD raising one head of swine, and that some farmers started slaughtering sows as a response to market conditions.
Despite the drop in pork consumption in the last decade, pork remains the dominant traditional animal protein.
The FAS forecasts China’s pork consumption to reach a record high of 55.5 MMT in 2007.
Pork imports into China for 2007 are expected to decrease due mainly to domestic pork production and low pork prices.
Decreased pork imports will be offset by an increase in pork offal imports.
China requires a zero tolerance on the pathogens Salmonella, Listeria and Ecoli (0-157) in 5 samples (total 25 grams) for all kinds of meats.
If these pathogens are detected at entry ports, China will destroy or return the goods.
Because China’s zero tolerance policy on raw meat imports is not based on science, the United States initiated several bilateral talks with China.
The US has negotiated a 45-60 day corrective period for meat plants instead of being de-listed immediately by China.
China began deliveries of fresh pork to Hong Kong in August 2006.
Due to transportation logistics between China and Hong Kong, China pork exports will be very competitive in the Hong Kong market.
European Union As part of the process of applying for membership in the European Union (EU), new member countries had to work on bringing their systems for monitoring the agricultural industry into line with EU requirements.
In comparison with the EU-15 member countries, only Spain and Germany had larger pig populations than Poland at December 2005.
Since 2003 annual pig slaughtering figures for the EU-15 have remained virtually unchanged.
In 2005 compared to the same period in 2004, all producers, except Germany, saw declines or virtually no change in the number of pigs slaughtered.
For 2006, very little pig slaughter data is available.
In the first two months of 2006, Belgium, Denmark and United Kingdom have seen a decline in pig slaughtering while Spain, France and Italy have seen increases.
United States The USDA December 1st Hog report indicates both market and breeding herds have grown just 1% larger than those reported in 2005, showing little response to higher corn prices.
During 2006, cash corn prices rose approximately 36%, increasing cost per finished hog by 10%.
During the period ’04-06, cheap corn and strong pork prices produced 34 consecutive profitable quarters for efficient producers.
Canada Quebec hog prices have been decreasing recently, and have been below Ontario hog prices for several months.
Quebec's Pool price and average Auction price for the second week of October fell $20 and $47, respectively, below Ontario's 100% price of $136.47.
In Ontario weaner/feeder exports have declined by an average of 7% for the period August till December 2006.
During the same period, the export of slaughter barrows and gilts are up by an average of 19% each week.
Provincial slaughter has been up 3% since October partially due to the cheap hog supply available from Quebec.
In the western provinces, weekly feeder pig exports through North Dakota have grown 19% each week from August through the end of 2006.
Meanwhile, during the same timeframe, prairie hog slaughter rates had declined 1%.
China Swine fever fears continued to affect buying interest in some regions.
New-born piglets as well as those that were about one month old were particularly prone to the virus infection.
Nevertheless, farmers were seen taking extra precaution in disease prevention to avoid potential losses.
Those producers who are optimistic about improved hog prices have started to replenish piglets after mid-week December.
With improved hog prices, the recent increase in feed prices had become less of a factor of consideration in farmers' plans to replenish piglets, as gain in income will offset the increase in production cost.
Medium-sized commercial farms were more active in buying piglet supplies than backyard farmers.
Table 1 Weekly Transacted Prices of Piglets in China
Source: sFeedLink 2006 Currency Conversion: $1 CDN = 7.0514 RMB or 1 RMB = $0.1418 CDN
Farmers in some areas continued to hold on to their hogs, some of which were already overweight, in anticipation of higher profits.
On the other hand, some hogs on offer had not attained the minimum finishing weight and were thus rejected by traders.
Overall, market supplies have remained low.
Due to the significant price difference between live production hogs and pork consumption, traders were able to make a good profit.
Near-term prices in the hog production regions may rise more strongly on positive demand, thus narrowing the price gap.
In the last week of December, Guangdong's hog prices were higher than those in Hunan by more than RMB1.00/kg. In Shanghai, prices were RMB1.20-1.50/kg more than those in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Henan provinces.
In addition, some pigs continued to be affected by diseases which conventional treatment had failed to work.

European Union The UK/EU pig statistics were released in December 2006.
Most of the data is incomplete or current up to the end of Q1 of 2006.
One interesting statistic concerns the first nine months of 2006 were overall clean pig slaughtering was down 1% on the year previous.
The entire European pig report can be found: http://statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/statnot/pignote.pdf Russia Russia meat imports increased 29.5%2 percent year on year in the first half of 2006.
Russian pork imports had increased 38.6 percent over the previous year.
The domestic pork sector growth was slower than previously forecasted for 2005- 2006.
Hog breeding was also behind forecasted numbers for the same period.
However, the pig crop is expected to rebound in 2007.
Due to last year’s lower prices and duties, Russia imported meat in excess of set quotas.
There have been increases in imports from Slovakia and Denmark of pedigree pigs and piglets indicating future changes in pig production.
Russia continues to uphold its ban on all Ukrainian products of animal origin.
United States According to Ron Plain, U.S. pork exports have set a record for the 15th straight year.
During the first 11 months of 2006, the U.S. pork industry exported 2.72 billion pounds (carcass weight equivalent).
U.S. pork exports are expected to be 12% higher than the 2005 figures.
The pork export total for 2006 is expected to be six times the export totals reported in 1993.
The forecast for 2007 is that this trend of growth will continue.
The big growth markets for U.S. pork exports in 2006 were Russia, South Korea and Mexico.

Manitoba At the end of November 2006, the Manitoba provincial government instituted a ban on all new hog barn construction within the province citing water and environmental concerns.
In December 2006, Olymel and Big Sky Farms pulled out of the OlyWest project leaving Hytek as the remaining project principle.
Hytek has announced that they will continue with the project and will look for other suitable partners.
The city of Brandon will become the focus of processing operations with the announcement of a second shift as Maple Leaf moves forward with it’s new strategy and re-structuring plan.
There has been some question as to whether the Brandon plant will be able to find labour required to run a second shift.

News Headlines Nova Scotia Hog Producers in Trouble NOVA SCOTIA - For Martin Porskamp, the math is simple.
He ships 120 hogs a week from his farm in Sheffield Mills, Kings County.
The problem is he’s getting paid $40 less per hog than it costs to raise them.
That’s a loss of $4,800 a week, or $19,200 per month.
Mr. Porskamp, president of Pork Nova Scotia, the provincial marketing agency, is one of the largest hog producers in the province.
But Nova Scotia’s 70 other producers are in a similar predicament.
A farmer who raises 2,500 hogs is losing at least $100,000 annually.
"It’s a bad situation, really bad," Mr. Porskamp said in an interview Thursday.
Some are already required by feed companies to pay cash because of their financial woes.
Many are not going to have the money to feed their pigs.
The crisis has been brewing for some time, but the province has helped farmers in the past, injecting $2.8 million over the past 13 months to subsidize prices.
Canada's largest food processor announced yesterday a major overhaul of its business, abandoning its old strategy, which was dominated by the production of fresh pork for international markets, in favour of a more streamlined, value-added approach, focusing on further-processed meat, such as sausages or prepackaged cuts, and meal brands.
The company said the sharp appreciation of the Canadian dollar, along with shifts in the global pork market, changed the landscape so drastically that it had little choice but to rebuild itself.
"We were in the fresh pork business for the purpose of selling fresh pork to the world," Michael McCain, president and CEO of Maple Leaf, said yesterday as he explained the major strategy shift to the investment community.
"The architecture was predicated on having a globally competitive cost structure.
Hog barn ban in Manitoba CANADA - The Canadian Prairie province of Manitoba has put a temporary ban on new or expanded hog barns during an independent environmental review of new water laws, the provincial government said on Wednesday.
Manitoba, home to one of Canada's largest hog processing plants, owned by Maple Leaf Foods, plans to regulate how much phosphorus farmers can spread on their fields in the form of livestock manure.
"We believe long-term action is necessary to reverse long-term damage to our waterways," provincial Conservation Minister Stan Struthers said in a release.
Manitoba also plans to restrict synthetic phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizers, especially in buffer zones next to water, making it the first province to regulate the use of synthetic fertilizers.
Pork Producers Praise Passage of PNTR For Vietnam WASHINGTON, D.C. - Calling it a tremendous victory for U.S. pork producers, the National Pork Producers Council today praised congressional approval of Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status for Vietnam.
The House and Senate passed the trade deal late Friday and early Saturday, respectively, as part of legislation extending various expiring tax credits.
It was the 109th Congress’s last order of business before adjourning.
With PNTR, U.S. exporters can take advantage of Vietnam’s accession to the World Trade Organization.
"Granting PNTR to Vietnam means the U.S. pork industry will be able to ship more product to that nation," said NPPC President Joy Philippi, a pork producer from Bruning, Neb.
Deadly diseases sweeping through China's hog farms CHINA - "Pig Fever" is sweeping through the expanding Chinese swine industry, according to swine veterinarians who have traveled there this fall.
University of Nottingham, England, swine veterinarians Steven McOrist and Stan Done observed the outbreak first-hand during a recent visit to China's swine veterinary centers.
China's hog industry is "rapidly consolidating" on a scale similar to that in the U.S., McOrist says.
Comprising a possible combination of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and other diseases, this year's "Pig Fever" outbreak has swept through this growing number of Chinese finishing facilities, resulting in more than 1 million culls.

Traceability … from field to fork Traceability is the ability to trace the history, application and location of an item or activity by means of recorded identification.
Specifically, it is the ability to locate and to determine the history of a food through all the steps in the food chain.
Products must first be identified on the farm and then the identification must be maintained until the food reaches the consumer.
Here are a few links to give you an overview of this issue, which is a priority for Quebec and Canada.
• Agri-Traçabilité Québec [Quebec agricultural traceability organization] has as its mission the development, implementation and operation of a Quebec system for the identification and tracing of agricultural products, for both animal and crop production.
Its primary mandate is to implement an identification and tracing system for the beef, sheep and pork sectors.
Quebec’s Fonds de développement de la transformation alimentaire (FDTA) [food processing development fund] in 2002 created the Technical Committee on Processing, which is composed of members from various associations, co-operatives, businesses and institutions.
This committee’s role is to lend support and act as a springboard for the transmission of appropriate information to each of the sectors on this subject.
The FDTA Web site provides updated information on various initiatives such as Can-Trace and access to the various issues of Traçabulletin, the Quebec newsletter on food traceability. www.fdta.qc.ca/index_eng.htm Can-Trace is an industry-led voluntary initiative committed to the development of traceability standards for food products grown, manufactured and sold in Canada.
Its mission is to define and develop minimum voluntary standards for whole-chain downstream and upstream traceability.
This national initiative created in July 2003 is funded by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada through its Canadian Food Safety and Quality Program.
The Fast Track newsletter provides regular updates on Can-Trace and traceability in Canada in a number of industry sectors. www.can-trace.org/ Canadian Identification programs: √ Canadian Cattle Identification Program This program is a critical component of the suite of measures that Canada has in place to protect human and animal health.

British Columbia Seafood Alliance and the Seafood Value Chain Roundtable
Brentwood Bay, BC March 2006
Executive Summary Red and Green sea urchins are handpicked by divers in the coastal waters of British Columbia.
110 and 49 active licences are permitted to harvest 4,885 and 186 MT per year in each fishery respectively.
Canada’s sea urchin fisheries are acknowledged as among the most sustainable in the world but the industry has been experiencing difficulties of late because of deteriorating market conditions.
The major market for sea urchin products is Japan, which consumes about 6,000 MT of roe (uni), about 75% of world total, each year.
This study benchmarks British Columbia’s Green and Red Sea Urchin fisheries with other prominent urchin fisheries from around the world, including California, Japan, Chile, Maine, Russia, Mexico, China and, of particular concern, an Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) Russian sea urchin fishery in the Kurile Islands.
The balance between production levels and product quality struck by each fishery influences its economic performance.
Sea urchin products from Japan and California obtain the highest quality ratings and prices and are the primary comparisons of interest.
A list of benchmarks for this study was provided by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
Establishing a consistent basis for comparing industries using these benchmarks required breaking out component parts which were available or could be inferred from other sources.
A comprehensive profile of each fishery was developed and mined for trends that could be used as discussion points relevant to the assigned analysis.
CA Japan 2 3 Canada's urchin fisheries seen as very good in this regard 3 4 Adopting EVM technology will allow more flexibility
BC’s sea urchin fisheries are generally well managed from a biological sustainability perspective and the resource management regime appears to be effective and fairly cost efficient in relation to others around the world.
Harvesters in Japan, Canada and the US recognize their success ultimately depends on the health of the resource and are willing co-managers of their fisheries.
From the business side, the competitiveness of the industry also compares favourably with other legitimate sea urchin fisheries, including the sector leaders, California and Japan.
BC’s urchin fisheries are the 4th largest in the world, 5th if the IUU fishery is included, with Chile, Japan and California leading.
When landed prices are expressed on a per kilogram of roe basis, BC urchins are generally at par with those from California while Japanese prices are just over double.
The same relationships hold for the average wholesale contract sale prices.
The Tsukiji auction prices for California uni are often considerably higher that those for Canadian product but this may reflect, at least in part, Canadian processors’ reluctance to sell through the auction.
BC’s urchin products industry has demonstrated its ability to thrive in challenging natural and business environments.
However, the market for sea urchin products in Japan is in turmoil because of the Russian IUU fishery on the Kurile Islands and virtually all producers are having problems.
This fishery produces a very highly regarded product at prices others simply cannot match because normal regulatory limits and costs are simply avoided.
It operates with virtually no government or market restraints and in defiance of any environmental sustainability, human safety or economic parity principles.
This is an issue of over-riding importance to both sea urchin fisheries in BC and the first recommendation in the report calls upon the Government of Canada to continue pressing this issue in bilateral or multilateral discussions with Russia and Japan.
All other recommendations in this report are subordinate to resolving this issue.
The report also recommends the suspension of GSU and RSU licence fee payments, without penalty, in those cases where licences remain wholly unfished for a full season for as long as the current crisis continues.
The GSU fishery in particular is in crisis and this must recognized by all levels of government.
Defining exactly what measures are most appropriate remains a problem because there are no empirical data charting the quality transitions of urchins held under different conditions and therefore no means to objectively and systematically assess the impacts of various factors and/or practices.
This is compounded by ambiguity in the measures of quality used in the fishery, whether it be recoveries, colour or taste, which leaves the basic problem of "how do you manage something you cannot measure?"
Benchmarked Competitiveness Study of BC’s Sea Urchin Fisheries:
Executive Summary p. iii
The first of these is to initiate a program to develop and adopt standardized methodologies to collect and categorize objective information on the product quality including: h water loss studies correlating water content of the urchin to the time out of water; h standardized methodology for calculating product recovery; and h standardized ‘reference’ criteria for product colour, texture and perhaps taste; and h heat absorption logs for all post-harvest intervals up to wholesale distribution.
Once these preliminary requirements are met, studies which assess handling impacts and product quality from various areas and at different times of the year can be conducted with some assurance that the analyses and conclusions are based on common reference points.
The benefits will include more effective handling options leading to reduced quality impacts, higher realized recoveries and higher prices.
A systematic effort to accumulate this data in a relational data base will provide a whole new dimension for optimizing the use of the resources.
Many of the most productive grounds in BC are on exposed coastlines and continuity of supply is often a problem once the quotas from protected areas are gone.
Problems with inconsistent product availability are often mentioned in discussions with Japanese buyers.
As a short term measure it may make sense to freeze some of the excess production and/or limit fishing on the South Coast whenever the northern fishing is not held back by weather, effectively extending the South coast season.
Over the longer term, establishing a system to inventory live urchins at an interim holding facility might make sense.
Harvesters are looking for cost savings and/or efficiency gains wherever they can find them and feel Electronic Vessel Monitoring (EVM) technologies offer considerable potential.
An EVM system is currently being piloted on a single RSU dive vessel on the Pacific Coast to get a better idea of its costs and capabilities.
This study recommends industry and DFO continue and realize whatever benefits they can from fuller implementation as soon as practicable.
Uni is a traditional product in Japan and presenting it to quality conscious Japanese consumers as a differentiated product requires a completely honest appraisal process to retain that most valuable of supplier attributes, credibility.
This is the other reason to develop the objective metrics outlined above: a properly and fully implemented system will be a powerful marketing tool by providing buyers with assurances that they are getting exactly what they want.
The idea is that once the program is established, purchases can be traced over the internet and investigated by lot number.
This means the industry is providing buyers, including consumers, with a tool that can, in and of itself, become a defining feature of the Canadian product.
The Sea Urchins from Canada group is still developing the infrastructure to support this process and continued CAFI funding for this program is critical Benchmarked Competitiveness Study of BC’s Sea Urchin Fisheries:

Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Canadian Agriculture and Food International Program Report Prepared by:
Benchmarked Competitiveness of BC’s Sea Urchin Fisheries 1.0 Introduction On behalf of its members, the Pacific Urchin Harvesters Association (PUHA) and the West Coast Green Urchin Association (WCGUA), the BC Seafood Alliance is examining market and operational issues to identify competitive strengths and weaknesses and to develop options to ensure the continuing development of a sustainable and profitable sea urchin fishery in BC.
The performance of the BC industry is benchmarked to that of other suppliers, each with their unique characteristics, to identify effective practices and possible strategies to improve economic performance.
1.1 BC’s Sea Urchin products sector Red sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) and Green sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) are handpicked by divers in the coastal waters of British Columbia to depths of about 20 m.
British Columbia’s commercial fishery for Red Sea Urchins (RSU) began in the 1970's but did not start growing substantially until the mid 1980’s when landings grew to just under 2,000 tons per year.
The Green Sea Urchin (GSU) fishery commenced in 1987 and quickly grew to about 550 tons per year.
Landings in both fisheries peaked in 1992 at about 12,000 and 1,000 tons respectively, even as Fisheries & Oceans Canada (DFO) took steps to control the harvest.
Limited entry policies restricted the number of licences to 110 (RSU) and 49 (GSU) respectively, and fishery independent surveys were initiated to establish sustainable harvest levels.
The TAC’s have stabilized at around 4,885 and 186 MT per year respectively with quota shares evenly split between the licences.
Grading and packing processes are critically important for these products and considerable skill is required to meet the Japanese standards.
Colour and size consistency and stacking pattern are all key indicators of quality to the Japanese consumer.
The final package for the product is traditionally a small wooden tray but supermarket sales more often simply use the same shrinkwrapped styrofoam tray seen in North America.
GSU are smaller and more difficult to process than RSU and are commonly shipped live to Hokkaido for processing, grading and packing.
RSU are processed to one degree or another by one of nine processors in the Vancouver area before being shipped to Japan.
Approximately 10% is consumed domestically each year with the balance going to Hong Kong, the US and China.
Sea Urchin Fishery Benchmarking Study

The major market for sea urchin products is Japan which consumes about 6,000 MT of roe (uni), about 75% of world total, each year.
France consumes approximately 1,000 MT of roe each year and is the second largest.
Uni is marketed in Japan in several forms: fresh, frozen, steamed, baked & frozen and salted.
The most popular and highest value use for the product is chilled fresh uni on sushi.
There are two sales routes into Japan.
The preferred method for Canadian processors uses contract sales at a set price to Japanese companies.
The other route is via consignment on the Tsukiji Seafood Auction in Tokyo but these prices are highly variable.
In Japan sea urchins are esteemed for their highly nutritious gonads, or uni, which is considered one of the most valuable seafoods, in some cases commanding a wholesale value in excess of $C 850 per kg.
The highest contract price for Canadian uni in 2005 was ¥ 5,960 /kg in August, about 20% higher than the average for the year and a little higher than the highest price last year for US uni , ¥ 5,900 in October.
Sea urchins have been fished in Japan for over a thousand years and while production peaked in 1969 at 27,500 MT, the harvest has stabilized at between about 10,000- 13,000 MT per year since 1990.
The market is much larger than this and the country now imports about 80-85% of its uni supply.
Live imports from Russia increased from less than 3,500 MT in 1998 to more than 10,000 MT by 2002 and to almost 14,000 MT by 2005, This increase has been ascribed entirely to the Russian IUU fishery.
This activity is having major impacts on the market, displacing product from legitimate fisheries and lowering prices for all suppliers.
The benchmarks established for this study are based on a list drawn up and approved by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
The benchmark elements can be broken down into four basic categories: 1.
Government policies: this category is interpreted to reference the support provided by government policy to the industry’s competitive position.
This includes subcategories of Resource Management and Sustainability.
All the fisheries compared in the study are wild capture fisheries and all importers operate under the same trade rules so the subcategories of Trade Policies and Animal Welfare were excluded.
Operations: this category refers to normal business operating variables.
It includes Management, Input Costs, Harvesting, Processing, Logistics/Transportation, Quality Characterizations and Continuity of Supply.
Marketing: this category refers to generic marketing initiatives and research undertaken and publicly circulated amongst companies in the various jurisdictions.
2.0 Methods California is the leading supplier of RSU products and Japan’s sea urchin product industry sets the quality standards against which all other urchin industries are judged, so these two are the primary regions of interest in this benchmarking study.
Other significant players are included:
Chile because its sea urchin fishery is the largest in the world, Mexico because it is the only source of RSU other than Canada and the US; and China because of its significance as a current and potential future source of both wild and cultured urchins.
The Canadian Maritimes and Maine are significant suppliers of Green Sea Urchin products and provide an important contrast for BC’s GSU fishery.
Russia’s legal and IUU fisheries are also included.
It is difficult to collect comparable data from all these countries as there are no recognized or required standards for data reporting.
The data collected by various countries are fairly unique to each and not usefully applicable to cross-jurisdictional comparisons.
There is a considerable body of scientific literature on sea urchins which Explorations UnLtd Inc.

Sea Urchin Fishery Benchmarking Study

discusses many factors affecting fishery performance in each jurisdiction.
It includes some fairly definitive data on absolute production (green weight), numbers of vessels, divers and plants, environmental conditions, sustainability etc. as well as more anecdotal accounts of costs, efficiencies and various other management, harvesting, transport, processing and marketing factors.
A comprehensive literature search of sea urchin fisheries in BC, the Canadian Maritimes, Japan, Chile the US, Mexico, China and Russia was used to develop an in-depth profile of the industry in each country.
The most widely applied method involves a five step graduated scale ranging from Very Low (0) to Very High (4).
This use of this is indicated on the charts or tables by the presence of ‘code 1’ in the title.
The first digit refers to the Table in Appendix A from which the data is obtained while the second is simply a reference count.
3.0 Results and Discussion 3.1 Government Policy 3.1.1 Resource Management 3.1.1.1 Funding Source and Government Involvement Governments fund the resource management process in Chile, Mexico, Russia and China, and the costs incurred are much lower than in the other jurisdictions where most of the costs are absorbed by the users of the resources.
The Illegal, Unregulated and Unreported (IUU) Russian fishery in the Kurile Islands is reportedly a venture between the Russian and Japanese mafia with no government involvement.
If a given measure is not used in the jurisdiction a value of ‘0' is used.
Canada comes in next using all the same measures as the US, including fishery independent surveys and/or research, as well as being the only nation to employ validation and on-grounds monitoring.
Minimum legal sizes are used in all the listed fisheries, including the IUU fishery in the Kuriles where it is reportedly included as a condition in the sales contracts.
Fishing logs are required in all fisheries, except for Chile’s and the Russian IUU fishery.
3 Exclusive area rights are used in Japan, part of the Canadian Maritimes 2 fisheries and the Mexican fishery and more limited parts of the 1 Chilean fishery.
Harvester permits are required in the other jurisdictions, including Figure 1-1:
Management tools used in various urchin fisheries.
Management Cost Index
This consideration has not affected ownership restrictions in Canada and processors own about 20% of the licences.
The interests of processors and harvesters are not always the same and there is generally a striking imbalance in the resources each can bring to the market.
Canada has the Competition Act to restrict un-competitive behaviours but the difficulties, costs and time involved in proving a case under this Act limit its effectiveness.
Ensuring a level playing field and providing continuing opportunities for independent fishermen requires maintaining a flexible, competitive and transparent market for licences and for the fisheries products.
Red Sea Urchin licences in BC are presently valued at about $150,000, down from about $250,000 over the last 18 months or so, while Green Sea urchin licences are valued at less than $50,000, both because of deteriorating market conditions in Japan.
These licence values are still considered too rich by divers and the industry is exploring avenues through which young fishermen can afford to buy an ownership interest.
Urchin permits in the California are not currently transferable, and therefore hold no nominal value, although fishermen and regulators are discussing changes so the fishermen can recapture some of the value they have built into their businesses as they retire.
3.1.2 Fishery Sustainability (Figure 1-2) Fisheries Cooperative Associations (FCA’s) in Japan have exclusive area rights for inshore fishery resources and control the product from harvest right up to the wholesale level.
FCA’s manage their fisheries with advice from Prefectural Fishing Agencies and are completely accountable if the resources under their control are depleted.
Natural stock abundance trends are not tracked in Japan, which coupled with the dependence on hatcheries and related concerns with genetic dilution and periodic disease outbreaks, marginally reduces the sustainability rating for Japan’s fishery.
Harvester accountability levels in Canada and the US lie below that in Japan but harvesters here recognize their revenues depend on the strength of the resource.
The sustainability situation in Canada has been acclaimed as one of the best by worldwide authorities, primarily because the harvest rate on mature (legal-sized) is only 2% in BC and 3.5% in the Maritimes.
In Maine, where mass mortalities reduced the biomass by about 80% in the late 1990's, harvests continue in the face of scientific advice from Federal, State and academic authorities.
Industry groups in California are advocating a move to smaller-scale management through fishing co-ops to bolster the effectiveness of the management regime.

These animals are protected under the Species At Risk Act in Canada, and under the Endangered Species Act in the US.
At present there are no criteria established to allow their removal from the endangered species list, which would permit management intervention.
Sea otter population levels and ranges are rapidly increasing, according to some reports at up to 15 20% per year in some areas.
Sea otters compete directly with mankind for shellfish.
Once a colony becomes established in an area, shellfish, including sea urchins, geoduck clams, crab, abalone etc, are quickly eaten and any commercial shellfish fishing activity is lost.
Sea otter populations are now expanding in SE Alaska, along the North and Central coast of BC and the West Coast of Vancouver Island from Cape Scott down to Tofino, and Central California down into the northern Channel Islands.
The economic consequences of continuing unconstrained growth of this species are serious, as shellfish fisheries in the US and Canada are losing significant resources each year.
The landings for the IUU fishery stand out in relation to the legitimate fishery in Russia as well as the other fisheries included.
It is interesting to note that the Maine fishery is still quite substantial, despite a significant reduction in biomass, and is about the same size volume wise as the Chinese fishery although the value is substantially higher.
Harvesting on the west coast of the Americas and in Russia is by dive only while the GSU fisheries on the Atlantic coast of Canada and Maine (ME) are both trawl and dive.
The quality obtained with the trawls is more hit and miss, as the trawl is inherently much less selective than 14,000 12,000 10,000 Landings (MT) 8,000 6,000 4,000 2,000 0 $14,000

The fisheries in Japan and China use similar traditional techniques, including dip nets, free diving and baited traps, as well as scuba.
Fishing operations can also be examined in terms of productivity.
In Figure 2-2, the average catch per unit effort is expressed as kg. harvested per diver-day for each of the fisheries.
These values are derived from literature, interview sources or deduced from the interplay of factors including the number of active divers, the season length, annual production and harvest techniques used.
The number of harvesters in Japan was estimated assuming an average team size of 4 at each of 250 Fishery Cooperative Associations in Japan to produce a total of 1,000 active urchin harvesters.
Explorations UnLtd Inc.
Catch per Harvester- day (kg)
Avg unit catch
Number of harvesters and the average unit productivity for select sea urchin fisheries.
Harvester estimates for Japan and Chile are 1,000 and 7,500 respectively.
One thing that stands out about the BC fishery is the relatively low number of divers involved and the high individual harvest rates in comparison to other locations.
The catch per diver-day in BC is, for instance, up to 17 times higher than those found in Japan and perhaps 12 times higher than those found in California.
Japan in the highest, Canada and the US in the middle, and less developed countries at a lower level (Figure 2-3).
Within these tiers the prices are assumed to fairly represent product quality.
In BC, the price for GSU, at about $1.70/lb, is considerably higher than the $0.65 - 0.70/lb paid for RSU.
In general, landed prices on a roe weight basis for Canada and the US are about 40 50% of Japan’s, while in Chile, China, Russia and Mexico, they range between about 5-15%.
Figure 2-3:
3.2.3 Management The market projection period (Figure 2-4) is an important factor affecting the risk for processors and buyers as they are estimating demand in the future for commitments in the present.
In more remote areas like BC’s North Coast product orders received on day 0 may not be delivered to the market in Japan until perhaps day 4- 5.
The time line might include one-half day to aggregate it with other orders and get it out to the grounds, 1.5 - 2.5 days to fish and land, one day for transport to the plant and one day to process and ship to Japan.
BC’s North Coast and Chile’s southern area fisheries are similar in this regard, as operations are quite remote.
This contrasts to the situation in Japan, where an order received on day 0 can be fished and delivered for sale on day 1.
California can likewise deliver product for sale in Japan on day 2 to 2.5, depending on whether the operation is a day- or overnight fishery.
3.2.4 Continuity of Supply (Figure 2-4) The RSU (GSU) fishery in BC generally starts sometime in mid to late September (mid November) and extends through to about mid-April (end of February) when the urchins become too mature.
The seasonality of BC’s fisheries is generally in line with most other jurisdictions, save for Southern California where good quality product is found all year because food availability is consistent and less seasonal.
California fishermen consider a constant presence in the market an important contributor to maintaining prices and demand and use this to their advantage to ensure availability in the market at all times of the year.
Areas with good quality are also found out of season along the BC coast but the areas have not been adequately defined to support year round operations.
In contrast, BC’s South Coast rank is #10 while the North Coast comes in at #12.
Chile is ranked at #9 but they freeze upwards of 80% of their production and can maintain a presence in Japan by drawing on inventory throughout the year.
The majority of BC’s urchin harvest comes from the Central and North coast (C&N) during the winter when the harvest operations are vulnerable to weather related disruptions.
When the supply chain is glutted, prices fall.
The glut- starvation situation in BC highlights the need on the North Coast fishery for some sort of "moderator" so the product flow from the grounds can be evened out.

3.2.5 Input Costs Wage rates, numbers of personnel on the harvest vessels, load factors for the vessels and factories and processing complexity indices resulting from the unique product mixes etc. are calculated for each country.
The Input costs have presented problems because of difficulties in calibrating the costs attributable to the different sets of activities in each jurisdiction.
However a consistent arithmetic methodology is used for all areas and the estimated costs of each activity are logically at least roughly comparable between jurisdictions.
The results for the different activities are totalled to provide a relative, as opposed to an absolute $/kg of production estimate (because of the calibration issues), aggregated ‘Unit Cost index’ for each country.
The unit input costs (Figure 3-1), or the costs incurred per unit of production, in each fishery reflect the relative remoteness of the fishing activity, the distances to the processing facilities and distance to market.
They do not include the fishery management costs.
The respective economic rating for the country (advanced vs. developing) is incorporated because of the general influence this has on the equipment cost and wage levels.
This lowers the vessel cost per kg of production so the BC estimate is only about 50% higher than Chile’s, despite the larger differences that would expected from each country’s economic rating.
The lowest unit costs are associated with the IUU fishery, in part because of the excessive and unregulated harvest rates.
The proximity of the fishery to Japan and the developing economic status of Russia also contribute to the low costs.
The legitimate fishery in Russia and the fisheries in China, Mexico and Chile all share the relatively low unit cost structures typical of developing economies while those in Japan, the US and Canada are on another level simply because of the countries’ higher developed status.
The production from the Maritimes is directly exported live to the US and the low unit cost index reflects the absence of any processing costs.
The unit costs are highest on BC’s North Coast, again because of the remoteness of the areas involved and the associated extra expenses required to get the product to the Lower Mainland.
If the Unit Cost index for each fishery is multiplied by its respective harvest, the total costs are logically related to the overall output of the fishery and to the numbers of boats, fishermen and plants involved.
Chile has the highest overall fishing costs in this regard simply because it is so much larger than all of the others.
Japan’s fishery ranks as the second costliest, although the differing economic status influences the ratio between the two countries.
Japan’s fishery is about one quarter of the size of Chile’s, but its costs are estimated to come in at about 1/3 of Chile’s.
Coded Unit Costs for various urchin fisheries.
3.2.6 Logistics/Transportation Operationally, the fisheries in Southern Chile and on the North and Central Coasts of BC bear a close resemblance because of the remoteness of the fishing activities.
Japan, California, Maine, Mexico and the Maritimes have more intensively developed coastlines and transportation infrastructures, and these reduce many of the costs and complexities involved with fishing and transferring the product.
For example, an estimated 1.8 to 2.8 days are required from harvest to get the product to market in Japan from the South Coast fishery in BC while 3.5 to upwards of 6.2 days are generally expected from the North Coast or Chilean fisheries.
This compares to about 1 day for Japan and 1.5 - 2.5 days for California, Mexico, China and both the regulated and IUU Russian fisheries.
The delivery times are estimated as a function of the respective distances involved and the infrastructure in place.

Accumulated Heat Absorption estimates (by interval) in select urchin fisheries.
The greatest contribution to, and the variation within, this interval is attributed to the at-sea transport of the live urchins to the dock.
3.3 Marketing Marketing’s aim is to create genuine customer value by offering superior solutions - using the touchstones of quality, service and price, to establish and support a mutually beneficial longterm relationship with its customers.
Marketing has long been recognized by companies as integral to business success but the same theme has only recently been picked up by countries and non-business entities.
The international sea urchin trade is very competitive, perhaps because of the limited number of companies importing urchin products into Japan, and companies are reluctant to share market intelligence with others for fear of losing an edge.
The Sea Urchins from Canada group has been working on a generic marketing initiative for the past three years and the companies involved have developed good working relationships.
The Sea Urchin Harvesters Association of California (SUHAC) appears to be the only other Explorations UnLtd Inc.
group in the sea urchin industry to engage in any generic marketing activities for their product.
In both cases, the Associations are focussed on providing interested consumers, domestically and in Japan, with information on the fishery as opposed to highlighting any brands derived from the fishery.
Information on similar joint actions in other producing nations could not be found.
3.3.1 Market Research In 2003, the Sea Urchins from Canada group produced a comprehensive sea urchin market study with funding assistance from AAFC’s Agri-Food Trade Program.
Domestic sales now represent about 30% of the sales volume and 45% of the sales value for the California fishery.
California reserves the majority of its highest grade product for domestic use and generally restricts exports to less-than-premium grades.
In Canada, domestic sales account for about 10% of both volumes and revenues.
Not all plants are willing to serve this market because they find small orders of little interest.
3.3.3 Product Forms and Product Development The highest value form in Japan is trays but many suppliers have trouble satisfying the stringent Japanese grading and packing standards and a large proportion of the uni sold on trays in Japan is imported in bulk and then re-graded and re-packed by Japanese companies.
The balance between production levels and product quality struck by each fishery influences its economic performance and, because they all sell into Japan, standardized market pricing calibrates quality comparisons between them.
Each country supplies a fairly unique combination of products to Japan (Figure 5-1), but these forms are more or less defined by tradition.
Product profiles for various sea urchin fisheries.
Wholesale prices for sea urchin products from various suppliers to Japan.
This fishery is strictly supply driven and is pushing so much product onto the market that suppliers have very limited leverage on prices.
Canada is further disadvantaged at this time by currency movements which over the past few years have seen the Canadian dollar appreciate by over 30% against the US dollar and the Japanese yen, putting extra pressure on margins.
The UVE is generated by multiplying the volume % for each product with its respective wholesale price and totalling the results for all products to obtain a single estimated value for each kilogram of sea urchin harvested.
In this case, the volume proportions and wholesale prices for the product forms are from Japan’s import data provided by the Canadian Embassy in Tokyo.
For a simple example with the Canadian Maritimes, multiplying the live production and bulk volume proportions (95% and 5% respectively) with their respective prices ($C 1.32/kg and $C 49.08/kg) and realized recoveries (100% and 8%) yields $1.254/kg and $ 0.196/kg which add up to a UVE of $C 1.45/ kg.
BC’s Green Sea Urchin fishery comes in second while the legitimate and IUU Russian fisheries follow in 3rd and 5th position respectively.
Interestingly all urchins from the latter three fisheries are processed in Japan.
The proportion of the TAC fished declined further to below 20% during the 2005/06 season, again highlighting the devastating impact of the Russian IUU fishery on this otherwise model fishery.
The California fisheries, with a UVE of $C 4.06/kg, come in 4th while BC’s South and North Coast RSU fisheries come in 7th and 9th respectively.
The South Coast RSU fishery, with an UVE of $3.53 /kg., comes in higher than the $2.91/kg UVE registered by the North Coast fishery primarily because most of the South Coast fishing occurs when demand and prices are higher but also because the recoveries from the South Coast are marginally higher.
The Maritimes fishery comes in 13th with a UVE of $C 1.45/ kg because the product is shipped live to the US at the landed price of about $C 0.70 per lb. and there is no Japanese price to apply.
Chile comes in 14th with a UVE of $C 1.35/kg, primarily a reflection of prices for frozen product which are generally less than about 50% of the fresh prices.
Japan retains the top spot in both because of the relatively high production volumes and the very high prices.
The North and South Coast fisheries in BC came in at 7th and 11th, reversing their order which again reflects the volumes landed in each.
Explorations UnLtd Inc.
No evidence of promotions by other jurisdictions has been found.
Establishing a dialogue with customers is increasingly recognized as an essential element of effective marketing.
Customer-initiated communications are especially empowering but there are as yet no means for direct communication between Japanese consumers, our ultimate customer, and Canadian industry.
Brochures, videos and a fairly elaborate website provide the public with opportunities, in English and Japanese, to explore the BC industry.
The website is regularly updated to include additional product, fishing and promotional information to consumers and more advanced communication capabilities through the website are planned.
SUHAC was the only other association found with even the basic information services.
3.3.6 Product Differentiation The values presented in the Product Differentiation are derived from literature sources and discussions with industry representatives in Japan and Canada.
The Reputation Elements use the Code 1 system to characterize contributing elements.
BC’s urchin products industry is perceived to operate a sustainable fishery in a clean environment (pristine waters) to produce a hygienic, good tasting product with a demonstrated dedication to high quality, honesty etc (Figure 6-1).
However our scores on innovation and grading consistency and perhaps on the perceived value score, are weaker.
A "reputation index" for the various suppliers is created by summing the values of the various elements.
Japanese suppliers have the best ranked reputation while US West Coast ranks marginally better than BC although it is probably more realistic to say the fisheries in the US, Canada and Mexico are equally ranked behind Japan.
Chile comes in just below this group, running into problems with taste, innovation, grading consistency and most tangibly with sustainability.
The reputations of Russia and China are ranked lowest although they and Chile are perceived as good value because of the low prices.
A previous survey commissioned by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada on Japanese consumers identified "product management and quality" as the primary reason behind consumer perceptions of superior agricultural and fisheries products.
This was found to be twice as influential as next most important factor which is in fact the Standards, Regulations and Quality Control regime.
Canada’s system was found a bit wanting in the former, but this was attributed to a general lack of familiarity with Canadian food suppliers.
These present a foundation upon which to identify common ground and perhaps become better known to one another as friends.
Gaining recognition from consumers comes in no small part from presenting a memorable identity on the store shelf.
Labels must now identify the source country as part of new traceability regulations, but this information is often fairly discreet on generic packaging.
Only about 35% of the Canadian uni is packaged in the final retail pack by a primary processor in Canada (Figure 6-2) while in the majority of cases it is added as part of the secondary re-packing operation.
California producers also target sushi restaurants where the chefs may identify the California uni as a characteristic of the restaurant so the branded source effectively lends prestige to the outlets handling them.
Independent promotions from credible sources, such as respected sushi chefs, provide additional support for the image of California uni as a unique and trusted brand.

In Russia, the situation seems to be hinging more on decreasing life expectancies, particularly for men, and the Russian population is likewise expected to decline over the next few decades.
In Canada and the US, the situation is similar but populations are not expected to fall because of immigration from areas like Chile and Mexico where the populations are still young and growing.
The continuing availability of workers for the processing and harvesting industries, including skilled and highly trained process technicians, vessel officers and engineers is, however, a concern because training programs have only recently started expanding in response to the imminent retirement of the baby boomers.
The approach of the Canadian government of increasingly limiting immigration to highly skilled and educated people is also impacting the pool of less skilled workers, particularly in the processing sector.
Current staff are getting older and there seems to be a rising shortage of younger people willing to work in these positions, much as has been the case in Japan.
3.4.1.2 Harvest Personnel and Skills The pool of active urchin fishermen is for the most part generally assumed to parallel the size of the urchin fishery in each nation.
This is taken to the extreme in Chile, where the number of participants dilutes the income to the extent that the economic stake for the individual in the fishery is very small.
The sea urchin fishery workforce in Chile is estimated to comprise about 7,500 divers, 1,200 skippers and another 1,500 crewmen working on 1,200 dive boats with perhaps another 100 men working on 35 packers.
Working this back through the total harvest, this yields a rough productivity estimate of about 4.9 MT of urchins over the season, worth about $C 865.00 before expenses, for each fisherman in the fishery.
Using the assumptions that about 250 Fishery Production Associations have urchin operations in Japan, and that each of these has a team of four to take care of the urchin fisheries, there will be about 1,000 urchin fishers in Japan.
There are increasing reports of difficulties in finding divers in the BC’s urchin fisheries.
The reasons reported include the work is too difficult and/or does not pay enough, WCB certification requirements are a barrier and/or isolation from friends and family, particularly on the C&N RSU fishery, makes other jobs look more attractive.
fishery is significantly higher at about 33.5 MT per person-year allowing the provision of what are only fair compensation levels when the remoteness and other associated hardships are considered.
The urchin fisheries in California do not involve the same degree of isolation but as permit owners approach retirement in California, there is no way for them to transfer their permits or apprentice new operators to take over their business.
This issue is now a priority with the industry in California.
All maritime industries in BC are facing a shortage of qualified vessel operators.
This is a consequence of the imminent retirement of baby boomers, and the limited opportunities that have been available in fisheries over the past 15 years since difficulties in the salmon fishery precipitated an exodus of workers from the industry.
The availability of graders and packers is not as critical in California where companies have access to a larger Asian community and skilled grading and packing staff are more plentiful.
It is, however, projected as an issue in Alaska, China and Chile.
In Japan’s case, each processor would have an average capacity of about 130 MT of green weight (live) urchins per year while at the other end of the scale in Chile, where the estimated number of processors is 25, the average capacity is about 2,500 MT per year.
In BC the respective numbers and capacities are 9 and 496 MT while in California they are 8 and 908 MT.
Assessing the capitalization and overhead levels is complicated by the structural differences in the various industries.
For example, urchin fisheries in Japan are a small part of a constellation of fishing activities, which may include crab, scallop, abalone and clam capture and culture, sea
BC’s sea urchin fisheries are generally well managed from a biological sustainability perspective and Canada’s resource management regime appears to be effective and fairly cost efficient in relation to other sea urchin fisheries around the world.
From the business side, the competitiveness of the industry also compares favourably with other legitimate sea urchin fisheries around the world, including those from California and Japan which are seen as the sector leaders.
Japan represents the largest single market for seafood in the world and remains the focus of the world’s sea urchin production industries, BC’s included.
Japanese consumers have consistently demonstrated a willingness to support attractive prices for superior quality products.
However, the fact that average uni prices have been in general decline for the past few years and that virtually all suppliers in that market are having problems is signalling that something is not as it should be.
In fact, a buyers market for sea urchin products prevails in Japan at this point because the Russian IUU fishery is pushing so many urchins onto the market that suppliers have very limited leverage on prices.
Reports from Japan consistently highlight the deleterious impact of landing 300 - 350 MT from this fishery each week on the Japanese market.
Demand and prices rebound when no Russian packers from the Kuriles are in port, but as soon as another load is reported, prices, and orders, for legitimate supplies wither.
A characterization of this fishery developed as part of this project suggests that its collapse may not be as imminent as hoped.
The urchins targeted by this fishery, Strongylocentrotus intermedius, reach a harvestable size (TD = 40 mm.) after only 2-3 years, as opposed to the 6 - 8 years expected in most other sea urchin fisheries.
Combining this high growth rate with the high natural productivity in the area, the rich sources of larvae from the east and north coasts of Honshu and the south coast of Hokkaido and the ongoing removals of other ‘predatory’ species from the area may effectively counter the otherwise unsustainable urchin removals, allowing it to continue indefinitely.
Recommendation:
The Government of Canada continue insisting Russia and Japan get Explorations UnLtd Inc.
this situation under control, reminding them of their obligations to support sustainable fishing and fair trading practices as part of the international trading system.
The result of this is that, through no fault of their own, GSU harvesters cannot sell their production at all and RSU producers have seen prices and demand limited by the IUU production.
In this light, the ruling by Fisheries and Oceans Canada that harvesters risk losing their licences if they do not pay their licence fees each year is not equitable.
Fisheries and Oceans Canada set aside, without penalty, the requirement to pay the annual sea urchin harvest licence fees for unused licences until the IUU issues are resolved or market prospects otherwise see improvement.
Industry and Government work together to establish a Green Sea Urchin processing capacity in the Province.
BC’s urchin products industry has demonstrated its ability to grow and thrive in a challenging business environment.
As noted in Table 2 above, its performance is generally rated as acceptable in all the benchmark categories although there is room for improvement.
In many cases, California and Japan realize better outcomes in the operations category simply as a matter of circumstance because their fishing areas are more easily accessible.
The operational performances of both the Red and Green sea urchin fisheries on the South coast compare very favourably with the California fishery but complications imposed by the remoteness of the North Coast fishery mean extra measures are required to simply get the same results as the others.
Defining exactly what measures are most appropriate remains a problem because of shortcomings in the metrics available to evaluate the effect(s) changes may be having on the quality outcomes.
There are no empirical data charting the quality transitions of urchins held under different conditions and therefore no means to objectively and systematically assess the impacts of various factors and/or practices.
Basically the problem is that "if you can’t measure something, you can’t manage it".
The issue revolves primarily around ambiguity in the measures of quality used in the fishery, whether it be recoveries, colour or taste etc., and how these are influenced by handling, geographic and/or seasonal variables.
The criteria used by the processors are characterized as unreliable and/or inconsistent as regards objective guidance or advice by fishermen.
Explorations UnLtd Inc.
Recommendation to industry: initiate a program to develop and adopt standardized methodologies to collect and categorize objective information on the product quality.
Suggested elements of this program include: 1. completing a study profiling the water loss rates from urchins to develop coefficients correlating the water content of the urchin to the amount of time it has been out of water.
A series of these studies will be required as the rates may vary with the maturity of the gonad and the temperature(s) the urchins are held at.
2. developing a standardized methodology for calculating product recovery based on fully drained weight, and which incorporates the above water loss coefficients, so recoveries obtained in different situations and locations are comparable; 3. developing standardized ‘reference’ criteria for product colour, texture and perhaps taste so product quality criteria obtained in different situations and locations are comparable.
Software systems which provide numeric breakouts of the contributions from component colours in digital photos are common and reference cards could be used to ensure consistent application of the colour and texture criteria in the field.
4. collecting and archiving temperature profiles of sea urchins in transit from the fishing grounds right through to wholesale distribution.
Preliminary temperature profiling studies on packers suggest the urchins warm up in the holds to the point where quality impacts are likely.
Once these methodologies are in place, studies to assess handling impacts and product quality from various areas and at different times of the year should be initiated.
The methodologies must come first so the studies can be conducted with some assurance that the analyses and conclusions are based on common reference points.
Variables such as transit times, season, harvest location, Accumulated Heat Absorption (° C -hours), inwater vs. out-of water holding, maximum post-harvest holding temperature, etc. can then be objectively assessed for their impact(s) on any of the defined quality criteria.
The benefits might include objective assessments of the effects of different handling options on quality leading to reduced quality impacts, higher realized recoveries and higher prices.
These studies, for example, are recommended to evaluate the effect of refrigeration in the packing fleet on product quality using pilot scale studies before committing significant investment into the systems.
One of the larger problems facing BC’s RSU fishery is the inconsistent product availability, even Explorations UnLtd Inc.
when only considering in-season periods.
This is particularly evident after Christmas when most of the South Coast quota is gone.
Canadian processors remain focussed on the fresh and tray markets as the best use for the product and therefore remain dependent on the fresh market to absorb all production before it spoils.
This reduces the flexibility available to the industry and may be unnecessarily limiting fishing opportunities in the winter when the fleet must be able to ‘make hay while the sun shines’ to fully access the quotas.
Processors in BC feel the price impact from freezing is so severe that it can only be rationally considered when there are no other options available.
However, the application of appropriate freezing for some North Coast product as an interim measure could provide a net benefit to the industry as worries about spoilage of unsold product disappear.
This would allow harvest operations to proceed at full speed whenever weather permits instead of being limited because of the market’s inability to absorb fresh product fast enough.
It is worth keeping in mind that between 500 - 1,000 MT of the RSU TAC has been left in the water for the past couple years for this very reason.
Frozen product could also be held over for the summer market to maintain a presence in Japan throughout to sustain consumer loyalty, at least until specialized niche fishing in the summer develops further.
In the short term, it may make sense to limit fishing on the South Coast whenever the northern fishing is not held back by weather.
This will effectively extend the season in the South meaning BC product can still be available when the weather shuts down the north.
Over the longer term, establishing a system to inventory live urchins at an interim holding facility where they can be accessed when regular harvest operations cannot should be considered.
Recommendation to industry:
Fishermen start estimating and recording fishing opportunities sacrificed (in pounds/kilograms) on the North and Central Coast due to harvest limits from processors.
These records should include an indication of whether the South Coast is or is not active.
This will permit more objective evaluations of the potentials of South Coast restraint and freezing as options to get more product into the market.
That report should be ready for general review at the end of this season.
Assuming successful completion of the pilot study, industry and DFO should accelerate the process which will allow industry and government to realize the full benefits from the adoption of satellite-based EVM systems as soon as practicable.
The fishing associations and DFO are looking for cost savings wherever possible.
Buyers and consumers from around the world expect, and are increasingly demanding, consistency, innovation, sustainability, and traceability at competitive prices from their food suppliers.
Uni is a traditional product in Japan and presenting it to quality conscious Japanese consumers as a differentiated product requires a completely honest appraisal process to retain that most valuable of supplier attributes, credibility.
The key steps in marketing are determining what the customer wants, providing it to them and then letting them know that you can and are providing it.
This is the another reason to develop the objective metrics outlined above: they are potentially a powerful marketing tool providing buyers with assurances that they are getting exactly what they want.
The idea is that once the program is established, purchases can be traced over the internet and investigated by lot number, providing buyers, including consumers, with a tool that can become a defining feature of the product in and of itself.
The Sea Urchins from Canada group is still developing the infrastructure to support this process and has introduced some of the ideas to buyers in Japan.
The buyers expressed approval, providing some encouragement that this path is worth pursuing.
The dialogue between the harvesters, processors and Japanese buyers has moved beyond the preliminary stage and all parties are considering what they can contribute to a growing list of marketing initiatives.
The Group is currently working with Japanese buyers on joint promotions in Japan in July at the Tokyo Seafood Show and later in August in some Tokyo supermarkets before the start of next year’s season.
Continued CAFI funding for the Sea Urchins From Canada Marketing program is critical and the proposal submitted for the 2006/07 and 2007/08 seasons should be provided full and fair consideration.
The program has established a solid foundation for continuing progress but government support is required if industry is to maintain a credible presence as a marketing partner in Japan.
BENCHMARKING STUDY ON CANADIAN LOBSTER
Submitted to:
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Submitted by:
Gardner Pinfold Consulting Economists Ltd
SUMMARY Industry highlights American lobster forms the basis of a $1.5 billion industry in North America (all figures in CAN$ unless otherwise indicated), and ranks as one of the most important species in the Atlantic fisheries in Canada and the U.S.
Canada Landings ranged between 40-50,000 t annually between 1990 and 2004.
Landed value is currently in the $550 million range, down from a peak of $650 million in 2003.
The decline in value is due to the appreciation of the Canadian dollar and a drop in landings.
Just over 9,700 vessels are licenced to fish lobster, generating employment and income for some 25,000 skippers and crew.
Canada exported lobster valued at $989.3 million in 2005, down slightly from just over $1 billion in 2002 and 2003.
The lobster fishery is heavily regulated.
Entry is limited, and licence fees in most areas range from $300-500 annually.
The lobster fishery is subject to seasonal openings, with vessel and gear restrictions.
A legal minimum size is the main conservation measure.
It varies by area, with most areas subject to the same size as the U.S. fishery (82.5 mm).
There are no limits on how much lobster may be caught, provided they are at or above the legal minimum.
The industry supports several hundred buyers and shippers of live lobster.
There are about 50 plants concentrated in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence producing various processed products.
All buyers, shippers and plants must be licenced by provincial authorities, with fees ranging from $10 to $2,000.
There are no limits to entry for buyers and shippers, though in most provinces they must meet certain investment criteria.
Processing plants engaged in the export trade must be federally registered ($1,500 fee) and must meet specified standards.
Plants and production are subject to periodic CFIA inspection.
Most of this goes to Gulf-based processing plants, augmenting their supply of raw material from local fisheries.
This output makes up a substantial share of the processed product flow to the U.S.
United States Landings ranged between 30-40,000 t annually between 1990 and 2004.
Entry is now limited in most states, with licence fees ranging from $290-480 annually.
The lobster fishery is open year-round.
Gear restrictions are comparable to Canada’s.
There are no restrictions on vessel size, though vessels tend to be comparable to those used in Canada.
A legal minimum size is the main conservation measure (82.5 mm).
The industry supports several hundred lobster dealers and four processing plants.
All buyers, shippers and plants must be licenced by state authorities, with fees ranging from $25 to $760.
There are no limits to entry.
Processing plants engaged in the export trade must be federally registered (for which the FDA imposes no fee), and must meet federal standards.
Regulation is strongest at the harvesting stage, less so at the processing stage, and virtually non-existent at the marketing stage.
In light of this, if there were opportunities for some redress of a regulatory imbalance affecting the ability of Canada’s industry to compete, they are more likely to occur at the harvesting stage than some later point along the value chain.
Legal size:
There is conformity between Canada and the U.S. in the minimum legal size for the live lobster trade.
This is the most important conservation measure.
There is pressure in some quarters in the U.S. to increase the legal size in order to improve the long-term sustainability of the resource.
In the event the U.S. increases its minimum legal size above 82.5 mm, Canada should adopt a legal size at least as great to ensure continued access to the U.S. market for live lobster.
Canada could, of course, act independently and adopt a smaller legal minimum and rely on shippers to size grade for particular markets, or it could adopt a larger minimum size to meet more stringent conservation objectives.
Seasons:
Canada benefits from its approach to setting seasons.
Fishing in most areas is allowed only in months when lobster quality is high.
As a consequence, most lobster is suitable for the higher value live market in the U.S. and other markets (provided, of course, it meets the minimum size requirements).
By contrast, U.S. effort and catches are highest in the immediate post-moult period when lobster quality is at its lowest.
About half of the lobster goes to the lower end of the live market, depressing prices for harvesters but setting up a buying opportunity for Gulf of St. Lawrence plants wishing to extend their processing season.
The current Canadian approach to setting seasons appears to serve conservation and market needs very well.
There would not appear to be any merit in adjusting the seasons, particularly given the ability of the Canadian industry to re-time the market by relying on holding facilities.
Industry cost structure:
The cost structures of the harvesting sectors are broadly similar.
The respective lobster fleets are composed of similar sized vessels (most under 45’), mostly operating within a few hours of their home ports and using more or less identical gear.
The rationale for vessel restrictions in Canada may be found in the desire to limit effort while also providing a measure of equity in the fishing opportunity (trap limits also help in this respect).
There would appear to be no sound reason for disturbing the current restrictions, particularly since the more relaxed U.S. approach does not appear to confer any competitive advantage on harvesters there.
Overcapitalization and destructive price competition:
The Canadian and U.S. fleets operate under the same owner-operator principles.
Though the rule is not always followed in Canada, noncompliance is not so great that it undermines the ability of licence-holders generally to extract maximum prices for their catches.
The same conditions apply in the U.S. fishery, and with the
Competitiveness in the Canadian and U.S. lobster industries aggressive buying of raw material by Canadian processors in the U.S., processors in both countries face similar input costs.
The shore price paid by shippers and processors (after buyer commissions) accounts for 80-85% of the cost of sales.
This means that all other factors (e.g., fees, labour and other operating costs) contribute just 15-20%.
Strong competition for raw material accounts for the relatively high shore prices.
The processing sector would argue for direct access to raw material through elimination of fleet separation.
Buying behaviour is a symptom of a more fundamental problem than a problem in itself.
It suggests that both the live and processed segments of the industry suffer from excess capacity.
Most firms in the industry continue to be supply driven, bidding up the price of raw material in order to maximize capital utilization and extend the season as long as possible.
Overcapitalization and aggressive competition for raw material arguably represent the main sources of weakness in the lobster industry (and other shellfish sectors as well).
This is the legacy of a lack of financial discipline in the industry that has seen governments support weak or failing companies in order to maintain employment in small communities.
Though the intention may be laudable on a case-by-case basis, taken collectively, such decisions tend to undermine the stability of the industry in the long run because of the price effect.
Examples of this may be found in each of the Atlantic Provinces.
The introduction of moratoria on new plants in key provinces, and the promise by some provincial governments not to provide financial support may help to establish equilibrium.
Provincial governments and federal development agencies must assess carefully the industry-wide impacts of any policies and programs that would undermine financial discipline governing the level of productive capacity in the shipping and processing segments of the lobster industry.
The overriding objective should be to establish a policy environment resulting in long-term competitive equilibrium between the harvesting and processing sectors.
Product safety:
Shippers and processors in both countries are subject to essentially the same set of standards regarding food safety (HACCP or QMP).
They cite variable and inconsistent auditing/inspections as the reason for instances of non-compliance.
They also fear industry-wide implications should product from non-compliant plants cause health problems in export markets.
CFIA, through consistent on-site audits of the production process and inspection of products, should ensure that all federally registered plants meet or exceed established QMP standards.

WHY THIS STUDY This study is one of several sponsored by the Seafood Value Chain Roundtable in its mission to foster collaborative industry-government action that "secures an enduring competitive advantage for Canada in international markets".
More specifically, this study is aimed specifically at gaining a better understanding of the lobster industry in Atlantic Canada, determining whether there are steps government and industry could take to enhance the value of the resource, and whether there are trade policy concerns.
The lobster industry was selected for study for several reasons.
It has for many years been Canada’s most valuable fishery and leading seafood export.
It is the most widely distributed of Atlantic species and contributes to the livelihood of more harvesters than any other species.
It sustains more communities than any other species, including communities home to processing plants and holding facilities.
Lobster is also the most important species in the U.S. northeast for many of these same reasons.
The U.S. also represents the largest market for Canadian lobster, typically taking 70-80% of Canada’s total exports.
Interestingly, Canada represents the largest market for U.S. lobster, in the past decade importing upwards of 50% of U.S. landings.
But signs of overfishing have begun to show up on both sides of the border.
For example, catches are down substantially in areas in the Northumberland Strait, and also in several areas in New England (off Rhode Island and Massachusetts in particular).
Scientists, managers and many harvesters in both countries have expressed concern about exploitation levels, and have argued for stronger conservation measures.
In short, the Canadian and U.S. industries are closely intertwined.
They fish the same species, confront many of the same resource management issues, and rely heavily on each other’s raw material and products in supplying the same market.
They also operate within similar policy and regulatory environments.
This is important because it places Canadian industry on a more or less equal competitive footing with its U.S. counterpart.
This report explores the elements of this competitiveness, examining in particular how the regulatory environment influences industry structure and operations.
Competitiveness in the Canadian and U.S. lobster industries
OBJECTIVES
Given its great importance as a generator of income and employment in coastal regions in both Canada and the U.S., it is critical to stakeholders in each country that their respective lobster industries function on a basis as environmentally sustainable as possible, while also achieving high standards of product quality and market acceptability.
As the major lobster exporter into the U.S. market, Canadian industry must achieve these standards, while also strengthening its ability to compete.
Against this backdrop, this study embodies two main objectives:
OUTLINE
We present the benchmarking analysis within a "Structure – Behaviour – Performance" framework.
This analytical framework provides a systematic basis for identifying the structural characteristics of an industry and how these characteristics influence competitive behaviour with respect to the key factors determining market share including investment and price setting.
These factors in turn influence performance as measured by such conventional indicators as return on investment.
Industry structure captures that set of characteristics governing the nature of competition among buyers and sellers at each level of trade in the value chain.
These characteristics define the competitive environment.
The relevant characteristics include: industry concentration – the number and relative size of buyers (plants) and sellers (vessels); buyer-seller relationships – formal and informal links between enterprises along the value chain; entry and exit conditions – the more open the industry is, the more competitive it is likely to be.
The report begins with an overview of the Canadian and U.S. lobster industries, examining resource, structure, regulation, production, markets and price issues.
This is followed by an assessment of competitiveness along the value chain, highlighting the factors influencing structure and competitive behaviour.
The final section provides an analysis of how the Canadian and U.S. industries stack up in terms of each of the several benchmark indicators.
II CANADIAN & U.S. LOBSTER INDUSTRIES 1.
INDUSTRY STRUCTURE Overview The Canadian and U.S. lobster industries share several structural similarities resulting in a highly competitive industry.
The value chain in both industries features several thousand independent harvesters, several hundred shore buyers, many independent shippers/processors, many brokers and distributors, all supplying a substantial number of food service and retail outlets.
The respective industries been shaped over the years by three key drivers: resource, regulation and market.
Resource: the industries fish the same species.
Lobster population dynamics, climatic conditions and fishing grounds are broadly similar resulting in the development of similar fishing vessels and gear, with operations subject to similar biological and weather opportunities and constraints.
This requirement, if observed strictly (not always the case), serves to establish a highly competitive environment at the first point of sale (between vessel and shore buyer) in both industries.
Canada also supplies most of the processed lobster market, with a substantial share of the raw material imported from the U.S.
Maine has also introduced a system to reduce the number of licences by allowing one new entrant for each five licences retired (retiring the licence is the only option for harvesters wishing to withdraw from the fishery).
The processing sector is comprised of some 2,000 dealers (buyers/shippers) operating from basic facilities along the New England coast (Table 4).
Fee (US$) is shorter than in Canada.
Some operate tidal lobster pounds, though Rhode Island n.a. n.a. most of the lobster is shipped directly to U.S. markets Connecticut 41 200 and Canadian processors upon landing.
In recent New Hampshire 129 100 years, 50-70% of the U.S. catch has been shipped to Total Source:
State fisheries departments Canada for processing in PEI and NB plants.
The processing industry, a major force in Maine in the late 1800s, disappeared completely by the turn of the century as conservation measures eliminated small lobsters from the catch and as landings declined dramatically in the early 1900s.
Four plants were established in Maine in the late 1990s in response to the substantial increase in landings and the sharp seasonal price drops.
Three of the four produce frozen product using conventional technology, while the fourth has adopted hydrostatic technology to produce fresh meat.
They compete for U.S. raw material and product markets with the larger Canadian industry based in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
For both countries lobster is the one resource that to date in most areas has withstood the substantial pressure by the thousands of harvesters participating in the fishery.
While fishing is permitted year-round, catches tend to be highly seasonal.
Though management is largely a state matter (state regulations govern the fishery much of which is conducted within three miles of the coast), aspects of management have been delegated to the Lobster Management Board of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission in an attempt to create a harmonized approach.
The ASMFC issued an Interstate Fishery Management Plan for Lobster in the mid-1990s, and it has been amended several times with the aim to reduce fishing effort.
The states continue to regulate buyers and shippers, with the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) responsible for food safety.
What seems clear from a comparison of regulatory frameworks is that the U.S. now relies on many of the same kinds of measures to manage the fishery – limiting entry, trap limits and size limits.
Differences among measures tend to be ones of degree.
U.S. harvesters fish lobster from Maine to the southern limit of its range in the waters off the Carolinas.
Canadian and U.S. lobster catches during the late 1970s and landings, 1980s.
Canadian landings dropped 40,000 from 50,000 t to the 40,000 t range Canada 30,000 United States though much of the 1990s, then 20,000 climbed to 52,000 t in 2001 before 10,000 declining to 45,000 t by 2004.
DFO and NMFS 1999 and then fluctuating between 30,000 and 40,000 t since then (Figure 1).
In Canada, lobster accounts for about 30% of total landed value.

Seasons last from eight weeks to eight months, with the timing and length determined by biological, economic and climatic factors.
This pattern limits the Figure 4:
The fishery along the coast of 16,000 southwest Nova Scotia lasts from the end of November to the end of 12,000 May, with the bulk of the catch 8,000 taken in December and early January when catch rates and 4,000 markets are strongest.
DFO and NMFS This fishery generally produces excellent quality, but in the last 2-3 years quality has declined due to warm water conditions.
Most of the Gulf fisheries open in late April when the ice leaves the coastal areas and last for just two months with a sharp peak in May.
Most of the catch is processed.
Other areas (off Newfoundland and eastern Nova Scotia) begin fishing in April when weather and ice conditions permit and continue for a 2-3 month period.
U.S. The U.S. lobster fishery is open year-round, but fishing effort and catches are concentrated in the August-November months when about Figure 5:
This harvesting pattern jan mar may jul sep nov jan mar may jul sep nov tends to produce a seasonal glut of U.S. landings U.S. Exports to Canada poor to fair quality lobster, resulting in weaker prices during the summer-fall period.
Unlike their Canadian counterparts in Nova Scotia, U.S. harvesters have limited scope to hold their catches to "re-time" supply and therefore must accept what the market offers at the time of harvest.
Upwards of half the catch has been exported to PEI and New Brunswick in recent years for processing.
MARKETS
Canadian shippers supply the domestic market as well as exporting lobster to some 60 countries.
In 2005, Canada’s lobster exports were valued at $989.3 million, suggesting that the total value of production ranged between $1.2 and 1.3 billion.
Source:
US Dept of Commece Industry estimates suggest that 45-50% of the imported lobster is processed in plants in New Brunswick and PEI.
Another 35% or so goes to the fresh market in Ontario and Quebec (during the summer and fall months when landings in Atlantic Canada are low).
The remaining 10-15% is held in Canadian pounds and re-exported in February and March when supplies are low.

PRICES
As the dominant final product market, supply and demand conditions in the U.S. tend to drive the price of lobster in Canada.
Prices have risen fairly steadily over the past 15 years, at least doubling since 1990.
This comes in response to increased market development and demand, while supply (catch) over the period has remained fairly stable (total landings have increased by about 10%).

As landings decline in Scotia-Fundy in January and February, prices rise, and may exceed $20/kg in periods of short supply.
By this time, the peak demand in December has been met and pounds would have limited supply.
Prices drop in April as the fishery in southwest Nova Scotia resumes, and as the fishery in the Gulf of St. Lawrence begins later in the month.
Prices tend to be at their lowest in May with substantial supplies on the market from all regions.
It serves the domestic market, is exported to other countries, or is held for later sales.
Through a combination of staggered seasons and the ability to re-time supply using holding facilities, the export price for Canadian lobster remains within a relatively narrow band of US$12-14/kg.
For example, the U.S. market is supplied from Canadian pounds in February and March, as neither the Canadian nor the U.S fisheries are active (supply from pounds occurs when the green export line in Figure 13 exceeds the red landings line).
The export price climbs during this period of low supply.
The export price and the U.S. shore price begin to drop in April as Canadian landings rise sharply, and as U.S. landings resume.
The drop in the U.S. shore price continues to September as U.S. catches reach their peak, and as Canadian exports drop off.

The U.S. market for live lobster has recovered to some extent from the recession of 2000-2001, generating a moderately rising price trend against seasonal fluctuations.
This has proven to be of little benefit for Canadian shippers as Figure 14:

III COMPETITION ALONG THE VALUE CHAIN 1.
OVERVIEW Transactions between fishermen and buyers, buyers and shippers/processors, and between shippers/processors and distributors/wholesalers and customers form the key links in the chain of market operations required to move lobster from the ocean to final consumers.
The ultimate aim is to satisfy consumer demand.
It is at this final stage of the value chain where the product flow stops and the process of price formation starts.
Prices are determined at each trade level as market participants each try to maximize their profits given the demand and supply conditions.
The final result is a supply of fresh and processed lobster at prices consumers are willing to pay.
The trade statistics also reveal that Canada is a major buyer of U.S. lobster.
It is processed and held here and re-exported to the U.S. in various product forms.
So the respective Canadian and U.S. industries and markets are closely intertwined.
For all these reasons, in trying to benchmark the competitiveness of Canada’s lobster industry it makes sense to use the U.S. as the basis for comparison.
Industry structure represents one of the key factors determining competitiveness.
In fact, as we explore the various stages of the value chain and the technical and logistical challenges firms face in order to operate in the lobster business, it becomes clear that structural issues – particularly as these relate to price formation in the port market – overwhelm all other factors in shaping the competitive environment.
The relevant characteristics are:
The number and relative size of buyers and sellers provide an indication of market power and reflect the degree of competitiveness in an industry.
Market power is normally expressed in terms of industry concentration: the share of sales or purchases accounted for by the largest individual sellers or buyers.
For example, in a market characterized by high buyer concentration, a few companies account for a large share of purchases and are be able to exert considerable influence over price.
The relationship is formal if the buyer owns the vessel and controls the catch.
This is not permitted in Canada and the U.S. (except in the offshore lobster sector).
The relationship is informal if there is separate ownership of harvesting and processing equipment, but with arrangements between buyers and harvesters that provide some mutual guarantees.
To the extent independent action by fishermen is constrained, transactions would not be subject to price competition from other buyers.
This could affect price levels and the speed with which prices change in response to market conditions.
Entry and Exit Conditions:
Freedom of entry and exit are fundamental characteristics of a competitive industry.
This means any new company or individual may begin selling or buying if it appears profitable to them to do so, or conversely, may stop and leave the industry.
It also means that existing participants have no way of barring the entry of others and there are no legal (regulatory) restrictions on entry or exit.
Where barriers exist, industry price setting or investment behaviour may depart from that expected in a competitive industry.
Concentration Harvesting In both Canada and the U.S. concentration is low at the harvesting stage.
This means that none of the 9,770 harvesters in Canada and 7,500 in the U.S. controls a sufficient share of the catch to be able to influence price.
Some areas have larger and more productive grounds than others and this results in wide differences in landings by LFA or Area, and within a given area, some fishermen catch more than others because they are more skilled, have better boats and gear, fish more productive grounds, or simply work harder.
Buyers are obligated to pay the prevailing shore price or lose the vessel’s supply for the season to a competing buyer.
In short, despite their large numbers, the competitive balance tends to favour harvesters (sellers) because of strong demand and finite supply over a given season.
Buying Buyers range from individuals operating in a single port and buying from a few vessels, to ones operating in several ports and in more than one province buying from hundreds of vessels.
The several hundred buyers active in Atlantic Canada and New England suggests low concentration, and consequently a limited ability on the part of any individual buyer to influence price.
Unfortunately, data to support this observation are not readily available, and nor are they necessarily reliable.
Anecdotal evidence suggests concentration is not an issue in the U.S., though it may be an issue in Canada, particularly in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, where a few buyers account for a significant share of the lobster landed and reportedly have some ability to influence prices by playing shippers/processors off against each other.
Many shippers and processors obtain raw material from independent buyers, rather than directly from harvesters.
There is no formal record of these transactions.
There are over 200 shippers of live lobster in the Scotia-Fundy Region.
Many of these are relatively small firms, marketing their product through one or other of the Region’s larger shippers.
Anecdotal information suggests the top four shippers in the Region (shipping for the live market) would account for less than 50% of total purchases within the Region.
American importers buy mainly from Canadian shippers.
Some have set up in Canada and buy directly from harvesters.
They hold lobster in tidal pounds and tank systems and airfreight or truck to regional distribution centres.
Wholesalers purchase product from air freighters, shippers and processors, and hold it for resale to retailers and food service companies.
Brokers are selling agents for shippers and processors who are paid a commission (2-3%) to arrange sales.
Traders are essentially opportunists who enter the market when possibilities for short-term profit present themselves.
Several hundred distributors in the United States carry Maine or Canadian lobster in some form.
While no reliable information is available on the quantities of lobster each buys and sells, industry sources indicate that four Boston firms handle about half the wholesale market (including both United States landings and Canadian imports).
Retail and food service At the retail level, lobster is sold to consumers by the food service sector (including restaurants, cruise lines, casinos) and retail outlets (supermarkets, specialty seafood shops).
A few thousand companies operate chains of three or more restaurants, and as well as there are tens of thousands of independent units offering lobster.
The total number of restaurants would be in the hundreds of thousands.
Buyer-Seller Relationships Fisherman – Buyer Lobster buyers (or "dealers" as they are also known in the U.S.) and fishermen are linked in informal ways.
The arrangement may be described as one of mutual dependence.
Buyers/dealers do not own fishing vessels (unless they are harvesters first and buy as a sideline) and do not have a secure supply of lobster.
They depend on fishermen.
Similarly, with few exceptions, fishermen do not own and operate lobster handling facilities (though some have small holding facilities in some areas), and do not have a ready means of marketing their catch.
Most depend on buyers.
Fishermen generally agree to sell all lobster to a particular buyer in exchange for an agreement by that buyer to provide a range of services including provision of supplies and credit, and access to unloading facilities and transportation.
Buyers also agree to take all lobster from that fisherman at the prevailing shore price.
Buyer – Shipper/Processor Through information compiled in this study and in past ones, it is clear that the image of the buyer as a small operator carrying out a modest intermediary function is no longer valid.
The point is that the larger buyers have some price setting ability in that they are able to extract higher prices from shippers/processors by playing one off against another at certain times in the market cycle.
In the U.S., the value chain tends to be a bit shorter, and these larger dealers function as shippers and sell directly to distributors.
Shipper/Processor – Distributor Virtually all Canadian shippers/processors exporting to the United States, and all dealers in the U.S., use independent distributors and brokers.
The principal markets are Massachusetts, Maine and New York.
Entry and Exit Harvesting Canada:
Limited entry licensing was implemented in the lobster fishery in the late 1960s.
This was partly a conservation measure aimed at limiting the expansion of fishing effort, and partly an economic measure to ensure fishermen were able to earn adequate incomes.
While no additional vessels may enter the fishery, licence transfers are permitted and the entry of new fishermen is therefore a possibility.
In light of the relative prosperity lobster fishermen have experienced in recent years, transferability has also made it attractive to leave the industry if that were desirable.
Licences are transferred in most areas for amounts in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and in one area at least, in excess of one million dollars.
These costs may represent barriers to entry for most individuals, but are of academic interest from a price competition standpoint because it is limitation on the number of licences that represents the barrier.
U.S.:
Out of concern for the health of lobster stocks, limited entry is now in force in all states but Rhode Island.
In Maine, entry is not just limited, but the State has introduced a system where five licences must be retired before a new one may be issued (so, the number of commercial harvesters will gradually decline).
Licence transfer is not permitted, so licences have no asset value in a secondary market.
Licence transfer is permitted in Massachusetts, but only to an immediate family member.
Buying Canada:
Depending on the province, individuals or firms wishing to become lobster buyers may have to meet certain criteria before they are eligible to obtain a licence.
But in no province is there is no limit on the number of licences that may be issued.
Where eligibility criteria exist, they include investment in lobster holding facilities to a specified standard.
Meeting these criteria could act as a barrier to the more opportunistic buyers (who have been known to act as a destabilizing force in the shore market), though size of the investment is relatively low.
Effectively, entry restrictions do not limit competition in any meaningful way.
Buyers in each state but Connecticut must obtain a licence.
The number issued is not limited.
Shippers require a licence in each province, but there is no limit on the number.
Shippers are required to meet certain criteria with respect to facilities.
Processors also require a licence in each province.
Processors require a licence in each state, though only Maine has plants in operation.
They must meet state and federal standards.
Entry is encouraged as a means of creating employment and strengthening communities.
Distribution Lobster distribution is a high volume, low margin business dominated by just a handful of U.S. companies.
Achieving scale requires development of sales channels and reliable sources of supply, as well as investments in holding facilities.
Other key factors influencing the decision to sell live lobster is price stability and year-round availability.
The substantial number of establishments involved in lobster sales suggests these are not major obstacles, though they presumably have a bearing on profitability and help to explain some of the difficulties in market development.
PRICE FORMATION
The interplay of demand and supply at the retail or restaurant level establish the market price at the point of final consumption.
This is what consumers are willing to pay, given the consumption options open to them.
This price (less a margin to cover costs and profit at each stage) is communicated to distributors, and in turn to shippers and processors in Canada.
Competition among shippers/ processors to satisfy wholesale demand establishes prices at this level.
Shippers/processors reflect this price to buyers who in turn express it at the various ports and landing sites along the Atlantic Coast.
Shore prices are established by the interactions between fishermen and buyers.
Industry structure and behaviour conform to the characteristics of a competitive market.
These characteristics effectively rule out the possibility of buyers or fishermen, shippers or distributors, being able to maintain artificially low or high prices (even if they wanted to).
Industry concentration is relatively low, implying that individual buyers and fishermen (or groups of either) have negligible influence over prices.
There may be informal ties at various stages of the value chain, but these tend not to relieve the buyer from searching for the lowest price and the seller from finding the highest price.
Given the number of competitors and the accessibility of market information, any artificially low or high prices would soon attract competition and drive prices to an equilibrium level.
Figure 16 Live lobster value chain showing prices and margins at each stage of the market PRODUCT FLOW CONSUMER PRICE FLOW
Fisherman-Buyer Live market The annual process of price formation begins at the end of November and tends to be a ritualized affair, with initial low offers from buyers rejected by fishermen until a satisfactory price is reached.
The time needed to arrive at a satisfactory price varies with the season, the area (in particular, whether it is possible for fishermen to hold lobster), market conditions and the financial position of buyers and sellers.
Fishermen play the market trying to extract higher prices from buyers and buyers play the market offering higher prices to fishermen while trying to extract higher prices from shippers.
Bluff, deception, fear and greed tend to be the main price drivers early in the season.
The fishery in southwest Nova Scotia is crucial from a price-setting perspective because of the influence it has on the general price level in other areas later in the season.
The fishery opens at the end of November.
Fishing effort is high because demand is strong leading up to the Christmas and New Year holidays.
Initial offers from buyers are typically below market.
Some lobster may be sold by fishermen who need cash or who lack holding capacity.
But most fishermen withhold supplies in anticipation of higher prices.
Prices rise as mid-December air shipment and trucking deadlines approach.
The risks for fishermen are shrinkage or holding out too long.
The risks for buyers are missed opportunities or paying too much.
Prices tend to remain high during the winter months (January-April).
Demand tends to run ahead of supply, with inventories (holding facilities) making up the difference.
Prices typically drop in late March-early April, as demand declines and in anticipation of the opening of the seasons in the Gulf and other areas.
The increase in Canadian supplies is accompanied by gradually increasing catches in the United States.
Total supply in spring exceeds demand, placing downward pressure on market and shore prices.
Much of the supply during this period goes into holding facilities to be held until demand drives prices up.
This occurs when the summer tourist season begins in the U.S. By then (late June), most Scotia-Fundy seasons have closed and demand for Canadian lobster is met from holding facilities.
Processed market Markets for processed lobster products are relatively stable, and this is reflected in shore prices in the Gulf.
There is sufficient information generally available about product markets (including wholesale prices and inventory levels) to reduce the scope for either buyers or fishermen to expect (or receive) prices that are out of line with competitive conditions.
Rebates are essentially end-of season supplementary payments reflecting actual market conditions over the season.
The use of rebates avoids the risk of delays in starting the season in the absence of an agreement on prices.
Fishermen receive an acceptable price at the outset, knowing that they will receive a top-up at the end.
There is no formula to establish the rebate; processors pay what the market will bear, knowing they are competing for supply for the next season.
Buyer-Shipper/Processor Many buyers operate independently, not simply passing along shipper prices to fishermen, but using their market position to influence the shore price.
Some of the larger buyers are known to try to increase their buy by using part of the commission to bid up the shore price.
They also try (and often succeed) to pass along higher prices by playing off one shipper/processor against another, causing shipper/processor margins to be squeezed in the process.
This is a supply-driven industry and shippers rarely turn down a buying opportunity.
Buyers operate on commissions of $0.50-0.75/lb, realizing net margins in the $0.20-0.25/lb range.
Shipper/Processor-Distributor Canadian shippers and U.S. distributors dealing in the U.S. market are supply driven.
They buy lobster when it is abundant and cheap, and hold it in the hope of selling when supplies are low and prices high.
The net margins earned by Canadian shippers tends to be low ($0.25-0.50/lb), a reflection of the limited value added in moving lobster to the Boston market and the costs of building and operating holding facilities (including mortality losses).
A typical discussion between a shipper of live lobster in Atlantic Canada and a distributor or wholesaler involves quantity, delivery, and price.
Competition for sales/purchases dictates that both groups have a good sense of market conditions.
Though there is some stability in arrangements, there is also the need to shop for the best prices.
Changes in market conditions are reflected rapidly in changes in price as distributors hunt for cheaper product and shippers for higher priced sales.
The distribution of the wholesale price is of particular interest because it reflects the relative bargaining strength in the industry.
These relative shares reflect competitive conditions in the industry (Figures 16 and 17).
Distributor-Retail The underlying principle for companies involved in distribution is to charge what the market will bear.
Selling prices are generally held for short periods and are subject to change depending on market conditions.
From a distributor’s perspective, "market conditions" means demand.
For much of the year demand is met from holding facilities in Canada so supply is generally not a major issue.
Canadian shippers will release supply at a rate that tries to keep prices as stable as possible.
The slow rise in summer gave way to a sharp drop after September 11.
2002: the weakness in late 2001 carried through to early summer before the typical pattern of rising prices emerged in early summer, followed by weakness in the run-up to the holidays.
2003: the year got off to a slow start, but then bad weather and limited supply forced prices to record levels in late winter.
Retail-Consumer Retail marketing of most products is based on stable pricing.
This is particularly true of food, whether sold in restaurants or grocery stores.
For restaurants, instability makes it difficult to plan menus.
For supermarkets, lobster prices could change substantially in the time it takes to prepare advertising and promotional sales.
In many cases, lobster is used as promotional item, often as a loss leader.
Most restaurants offering lobster do so at prices "subject to market conditions".
To try to push prices beyond levels consumers are willing to pay would be self-defeating.
If this margin were narrowed unacceptably due to high wholesale prices, restaurants would react by taking lobster off the menu until prices come down.
IV BENCHMARK ANALYSIS 1.
OVERVIEW This chapter provides an analysis of the competitive environment facing the Canadian and U.S. lobster industries measured in terms of several benchmark indicators.
These indicators cover a range of regulatory, operational, market and administrative issues, many of which spring from government policy.
An underlying question in the analysis is whether the respective industries operate on more or less an equal footing, and if not, whether any changes to the regulatory environment could improve the competitive position of Canadian industry.
Standing back from the detail, it seems clear that the regulatory environment diminishes greatly as the lobster moves up the value chain.
In light of this, if there were opportunities for some redress of a regulatory imbalance, they are more likely to occur at the harvesting stage than some later point along the value chain.
The main conclusion to emerge from the benchmark analysis is that the industries operate on more or less an equal footing at each stage and that there is little that could be done from a regulatory standpoint that would improve the competitiveness of the Canadian industry.
POLICY – REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
Resource conservation and management Harvesters in Canada and the U.S. engaged in fishing market lobster face identical regulations regarding the key parameter of the fishery: legal size.
Lobsters entering the live trade in the U.S. must have a carapace length of at least 82.5 mm (3.25 inches).
Canadian harvesters and processors in the Gulf of St. Lawrence enjoy a competitive advantage in the processed lobster trade.
Harvesters are permitted to land and processors are permitted to use lobster as small as 67.5 mm.
Canadian harvesters may keep females as long as they are not bearing eggs.
U.S. harvesters are required to V-notch and return females.
Seasons: on the face of it, the rules would appear to favour U.S. harvesters because they may fish year-round, thereby optimizing income by utilizing capital more efficiently, harvesting when lobsters reach peak intrinsic quality, and timing their effort to coincide with market conditions.
But the catch data show that effort is concentrated in the postmoult period (August-November) when catch rates are highest, but when lobster is at its lowest quality.
This period coincides with a strong local market, and also with the months of limited competition from Canada.
By contrast, though Canadian harvesters are constrained from a timing and duration standpoint, the seasons are set to balance resource (limiting the overall catch) and market considerations (both quality and price).
Industry regulation Both Canada and the U.S. rely on the same kinds of measures to regulate the industry.
Many of these have been introduced only recently into the U.S. fisheries, and in most instances, the measures are less stringent than those facing Canadian harvesters.
Limited entry: applicable in Canada since the early 1960s, this measure has gradually found its way into the U.S. fisheries (applicable in all states but Rhode Island).
In Canada it serves both conservation and income distribution objectives, while in the U.S. it has been introduced chiefly on the merits of its conservation benefits.
Trap limits:
The higher limit in the U.S. presumably allows harvesters to catch what is available within the space of a few months.
So the trap limit does not limit the overall catch as much as it assures all harvesters an opportunity to share the resource equitably.
Vessel restrictions: in practice, the presence or absence of vessel restrictions confer no advantages since harvesters in both countries use vessels <45’.
Canada restricts vessel length for the lobster fisheries to <45’ in most areas and <35’ in some.
An increasing number of vessels participates in the fishery during the January-March period in response to high catch rates and strong markets.
No vessel restrictions apply in the U.S., though most vessels fish inshore grounds and are <45’.
This places harvesters and buyers/shippers/processors on the same footing in both countries.
Licence fees: harvesters in both countries must pay annual licence fees.
Fee levels in most areas are comparable in absolute terms (ranging from $100 to $500), and account for a small percentage of total revenues (generally less than 1% range).
Fees in ScotiaFundy Region LFA 34 are $1,890 annually (the highest in Canada), but this fishery generated average vessel revenues of $230,000 in 2004.
Licence transfer:
Canadian licence-holders may transfer their licences.
In the U.S., transfers are not permitted except in Massachusetts and Connecticut, where transfer to a family member is permitted.
The difference in treatment is noteworthy because of the impact on vessel cost structure in Canada and the potential implications this carries for increased harvesting pressure and higher price expectations.
Trade The trade in lobster between Canada and the U.S. is open and brisk in both directions.
With the exception of minimum legal size, trade is subject to similar rules and standards governing food safety and country of origin labeling (see Table 8).
Canada maintains a smaller legal minimum size in several fisheries in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
As a less valuable size, it provides the basis for a processing industry (producing various frozen in-shell and meat products) exporting mainly to the U.S. This industry also relies heavily on lobster imported from the U.S. during the seasonal peak when prices drop to levels making processing a viable option.
Directing these volumes of market size lobster to processing in Canada benefits the industries in both countries, providing processors with a source of supply to extend their production seasons and keeping prices up in live market.

Competitiveness in the Canadian and U.S. lobster industries
Plant standards and inspection: processing plants in both countries must meet essentially the same standard if they wish to export.
In Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) ensures plants meet HACCP standards or have a Quality Management Program (QMP) in place that meets reference standards.
This has proven to be a challenge for many plants.
CFIA conducts periodic compliance verifications, with frequency determined by an assessment of the risks the plant poses.
Some in the industry have expressed concern that some plants meet standards on paper only, and that inconsistency in the way inspections are conducted and standards are applied could lead to problems for the industry as a whole should a food safety issue arise at some point.
In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for ensuring that plants meet HACCP standards.
Plant licence, registration and product inspection fees: all plants are required to hold valid licences issued by provincial or state authorities.
Plants wishing to export must be federally registered and shipments are subject to random inspections.
The annual CFIA registration fee is $1,500.
A certificate costing $25 is required for each shipment, up to a maximum of $25,000.
For processed lobster, the label appears on the packaging.
In the U.S., plants pay annual state licencing fees ranging from $100 to $635.
There is no fee for FDA registration and no fees for food safety inspections carried out by the FDA.
But unannounced validation audits are carried out by NMFS on a monthly or quarterly basis, and are charged to the plant on a fee for service basis (at US$117/hour).
Audit costs range between US$1,000 for a small plant to several thousand dollars for a large facility.
U.S. products are identified by "Product of U.S.A." labels, as well as any industry promotional efforts.
For example, Maine Lobster Processors Inc.
(a four-member industry organization) will allow any processors meeting its internally developed standards and packing specifications to affix its quality seal to the product.
Animal welfare Animal rights activists in the U.S. are turning their attention to lobster following some successes in the U.K., Norway and New Zealand.
The focus ranges from the development and adoption of more humane transportation methods and holding facilities, to efforts to include lobster in animal welfare legislation (effectively disallowing taking a live animal home and putting it in a pot of boiling water).
In the U.S., Whole Foods Inc has taken up the cause, announcing in late 2005 that it would discontinue the sale of live lobsters unless it finds a humane way of transporting and storing them.
Any such initiatives could have a more serious impact on the Canadian industry because its higher quality live product is more likely to be sold through higher end outlets.
Management There are no identifiable differences between Canadian and U.S. industry structure and management at a macro level that materially affect the ability of firms to compete on an equal footing.
Enterprises in both countries operate independently and compete aggressively; harvesters to maximize individual shares of the catch, and buyers and shippers/processors to maximize their purchases of lobster in port markets.
In neither country is there any form of industry association on the harvesting (selling) or shipping/processing (buying) sides of the market that would provide industry in one country or the other with a competitive advantage.
If one country has a competitive advantage it would be Canada, because of the intrinsically higher quality of the lobster.
Ultimately, this comes down to how the fishery is managed.
Higher quality has allowed Canadian shippers selling live lobster to differentiate their product and focus on higher price market segments.
The short U.S. season and relatively poor quality soft-shell lobster present a challenge for U.S. companies; much of the product sold live finds its way into lower price market segments.
On the other hand, what poses a marketing challenge for U.S. firms provides a supply opportunity for Canadian processors.
The rising value of the Canadian dollar has made this a more attractive proposition since 2002.
Canadian companies may face increasing competition for raw material, as a processing industry is beginning to emerge in Maine.
Input costs The factors influencing the costs of production are similar in both countries.
Harvesters use similar size vessels and the same gear, and face similar operating costs.
Buyers and shippers in Canada tend to operate more sophisticated holding facilities because they need to hold lobster for longer periods, either to season them before shipping or to wait for improved market conditions.
Maine had been known for its large tidal pounds, but few of these continue to operate due to the increased risk (disease is more prevalent, and markets more volatile).
Also, much of the lobster that had been held in the past is now exported to Canada for processing, with some also held in tanks and pounds in Nova Scotia for later re-export for the live market.
The entry of Canadian processors into the Maine live lobster market also provides an ancillary benefit for Canadian shippers by putting upward pressure on the U.S. shore price.
They buy all (U.S.) or much (Canada) of their raw material from the same source (Maine harvesters and buyers), produce the same range of products, and have access to and use the same technology.
If there were a competitive advantage, it would lie with U.S. processors because they buy raw material only at times of peak supply and lowest price.
But the entry of Canadian processors into the same market (and buying substantially higher quantities of lobster) would neutralize any input cost advantage from this source.
Prices paid for raw material from Canadian harvesters in the Gulf are comparable to the Maine shore prices, despite the lack of competition from shippers of live product in Canada (most Gulf lobster is below the minimum size for entry to the U.S. live market).
Quality The live market in the U.S. divides into two quality segments.
Canadian hard-shell lobster meets requirements (size and meat content) at the upper end of the market, while U.S. soft-shell lobster meets requirements of the lower end of the market (coastal tourism trade and retail loss leader).
The difference in quality is attributable to the timing of the respective catches.
Most Canadian lobster is caught well after or well before the moult when the animals are fully meated and robust.
Most U.S. lobster is caught just after the summer moult when catch rates are highest, but when quality (soft shell and low meat content) is lowest.
Continuity of supply The ability of Canadian companies to provide the market with a steady supply year-round is attributable to the scale and sophistication of holding facilities.
While there are still tidal pounds in suitable areas (e.g., southwest Nova Scotia), Canadian industry has invested heavily in various forms of holding capacity on land that provide more stable environmental conditions, reduce risk and facilitate holding for extended periods if necessary.
This holding capacity is sufficiently large to allow the industry to re-time supply so as to maximize revenues.
It has also greatly facilitated market development by allowing the industry to ship high quality lobster world-wide on a year-round basis to meet customer specifications with respect to quantity, size and timing.
MARKETING
Market research and development The industries in both countries have access to the same pricing and market intelligence services, as well as the same price and market information from the same large distributors in the U.S. who handle live and processed product for most companies.
In both countries, market research is conducted on a firm-by-firm basis, if at all.
Those firms investing in market research aim to be market driven.
They invest in quality and customer service, trying to differentiate the product with a view to commanding a higher price to cover the costs of more selective buying and investments in holding facilities for year-round delivery.
The firms shopping product are supply driven, simply feeding the market with an undifferentiated commodity and accepting what the market will bear as long as supplies last.
Similar circumstances obtain in the U.S., though the merits of conducting market research are less obvious, given the characteristics of the fishery and the lobster it produces.
The combination of a flood of lobster in a short season, limited holding capacity, and a soft-shell and less robust lobster leaves the industry with a narrow range of market options.
The lobster is destined for the live market (much of it going to coastal restaurants during tourism season or to retail outlets as loss leader promotions), or for processing in Canada.
In short, dealers find themselves in much the same supply driven position as many Canadian firms, shopping product to the highest bidder.
Product development Much of the market cachet associated with lobster is that it is a live product.
Since there can be no variation of live, it is the processed segment of the market that holds out the opportunity for product development.
Product development continues to occur in the processed segment, but innovation moves slowly.
Until the 1970s, the industry relied almost exclusively on the production of meat (hot and cold pack).
The introduction of brine frozen lobster (popsicle pack) in the late 1970s was a major advance.
This came in response to growing demand for in-shell packs, and was facilitated by advances in transportation and frozen storage facilities.
In the 1980s and 1990s, the industry continued to innovate, introducing more specialized packs including raw and cooked frozen tails (to compete with spiny and rock lobster), frozen and spit lobster, portion controlled packs and vacuum packs.
Further growth in the EU market for frozen products is constrained by tariffs in the 20% range.
The industry would clearly benefit from elimination or lowering of tariffs of this kind, one of the matters under discussion during the Doha Round of trade liberalization negotiations.
The most important innovation in recent years is the development of a hydrostatic pressure technique to extract meat from the shell without first cooking the lobster.
This opens up a range of possibilities for new dishes and formats relying on raw lobster.
At present, one company is pioneering the technology in Canada, with an American company reportedly introducing it in its U.S. operations.
With respect to both quality and the ability to re-time supply, Canadian industry is ahead of its U.S. counterpart.
Promotion The Atlantic Canada Lobster and Seafood Promotion Group promotes Atlantic Canada lobster internationally.
By participating in various trade shows and trade missions, and meeting with incoming buyers, journalists and chefs, the Promotion Group provides an opportunity for prospective customers to learn more about the Atlantic Canada lobster industry and available products.
These shows and missions also provide the Promotion Group with the opportunity to learn more about foreign markets and what they are looking for.
The Atlantic Canada Lobster and Seafood Promotion Group is coordinated by the Prince Edward Island Seafood Processors Association on behalf of the Fisheries Council of Canada which manages the project.
The Maine lobster industry believes product differentiation is important and is developing a "Maine" brand through the Maine Lobster Promotion Council.
With country of origin labeling now mandatory, it will be a straightforward matter to tell U.S. from Canadian lobsters.
Market development The respective industries rely to a limited extent on generic promotion as a market development tool.
As a rule, firms conduct their own market development acting independently.
The main initiatives are participation in trade shows (e.g., Boston and Brussels) and direct contact with customers in the U.S., EU and the Far East.
Given the commodity nature of much of the product line, product differentiation is a key element in market development campaigns.
Otherwise competition reduces to a single element – price.
At the industry level (i.e., Canada vs. U.S.), Canadian firms differentiate live lobster on the basis of quality characteristics.
Differentiation represents more of a challenge for firms within the Canadian industry, since many have access to the same lobster.
Market development becomes a matter of selling other valued elements such as consistency of supply, reliable delivery and customer service.
In late 2005 and early 2006, though, the U.S. Customs Service stepped up its inspections of trucks carrying Canadian lobster to the U.S., discovering a relatively high proportion of lobsters violating U.S. minimum size restrictions.
This served as a wake-up call for Canadian authorities as well, since the same size restrictions apply in Canada.
In other markets, the access issue revolves around tariff and non-tariff barriers.
Access is also compromised through the use of non-tariff barriers, for example, using incorrect testing protocols to bar entry to EU markets.
where the French barred the entry of a lobster shipment because it was found to exceed acceptable levels of cadmium based on a test of the liver rather than the meat, as required.
Packaging Canadian industry does not face any packaging challenges that adversely affect its competitive position.
ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES
Human resources The harvesting sector is beginning to face human resource issues, though these have not yet affected the lobster fleets.
For some other fleets, the challenge is to find people who are willing to take seasonal jobs, often in difficult conditions.
This issue does not yet confront the lobster fishery because in most LFAs it is conducted during the spring or summer months when labour is available and conditions are favourable.
In the southwest Nova Scotia, where the season runs through winter and early spring (six months), the fishery is sufficiently lucrative that finding crews is not a problem.
Lobster processors confirm they are encountering difficulties finding people to work in the plants.
The work is seasonal and irregular (heavy demand in May and June and then nothing until August-September), and in many areas there are insufficient weeks of operation to allow workers to qualify for Employment Insurance (eligibility requirements for harvesters are less stringent).
Also, skill levels in plants are higher than they used to be with the requirement to meet QMP standards.
Overhead The Canadian industry has adapted in various ways to the differences in seasonal supply and demand.
For live lobster, the seasonal open times result in two peaks, one in the DecemberJanuary period, and the other in the April-June period.
Shippers have invested heavily in holding facilities in order to re-time the market to ensure supplies are available to meet periods of high demand.
This strategy avoids gluts, allows new markets to be developed, and contributes to price stability.
Though buying when supply is abundant ties up working capital, the use of holding facilities improves firms’ operating flexibility by allowing them to release supply when most advantageous from a price perspective.
The substantial level of holding capacity in Atlantic Canada acts as a two-edged sword.
On the one hand it provides a basis for greater operating flexibility, but on the other hand it facilitates more aggressive buying by shippers who know they have the ability to hold out for higher prices.
The result is higher shore prices and greater risk-taking by shippers in trying to second-guess when price peaks on the demand side may occur.
Companies involved in the processed market take advantage of seasonal supply fluctuations by buying when prices are at their lowest.
But it means that the few U.S. processors in the industry face the same raw material input costs as their Canadian counterparts, making it difficult to undercut the market without incurring losses.
Capitalization Buying behaviour in both the live and processed segments of the industry in Canada suggests that both segments suffer from excess capacity.
Most firms in the industry continue to be supply driven, bidding up the price of raw material in order to maximize capital utilization and extend the season as long as possible.
Unless they market effectively (through well-developed programs with established customers), they run the risk of oversupply situations and distress selling into a declining market.
Overcapitalization and aggressive competition for raw material supply arguably represents the main source of weakness in the lobster industry (and other shellfish sectors as well).
Of course, the attempt by government to support rural communities is not unique to Canada.
We note that at least one of the lobster processing plants established in Maine in the late 1990s received a US$400,000 grant from government sources.
This observation is not meant as a condemnation of a policy aimed at supporting community initiatives, but rather to highlight the potential implications for the industry of such initiatives.
By alleviating the need for companies to find private financing for capital and working capital, companies effectively have more financial room to bid up raw material prices, thereby creating a more challenging competitive environment for the industry as a whole.
V CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS 1.
INDUSTRY HIGHLIGHTS American lobster forms the basis of a $1.5 billion industry in North America (all figures in CAN$ unless otherwise indicated), and ranks as one of the most important species in the Atlantic fisheries in Canada and the U.S.
The lobster fishery is heavily regulated.
Entry is limited, and the fishery is subject to seasonal openings, with vessel and gear restrictions.
A legal minimum size is the main conservation measure.
It varies by area, with most areas subject to the same size as the U.S. fishery (82.5 mm).
There are no limits on how much lobster may be caught, provided they are at or above the legal minimum.
The industry supports several hundred buyers and shippers of live lobster.
There are about 50 plants concentrated in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence producing various processed products.
All buyers, shippers and plants must be licenced by provincial authorities.
There are no limits to entry for buyers and shippers, though in most provinces they must meet certain investment criteria.
Processing plants engaged in the export trade must be federally registered and must meet specified standards.
Most of this goes to Gulfbased processing plants, augmenting their supply of raw material from local fisheries.
The lobster fishery is more closely regulated than it used to be.
The industry supports several hundred lobster dealers and a handful of processing plants.
All buyers, shippers and plants must be licenced by state authorities.
Processing plants engaged in the export trade must be federally registered, and must meet federal standards.
Plants and production are subject to periodic NMFS inspection.
REGULATION AND COMPETITION
The main conclusion to emerge from the benchmark analysis is that the Canadian and U.S. industries operate on more or less an equal footing at each stage.
Fishing in most areas is allowed only in months when lobster quality is high.
As a consequence, most lobster is suitable for the higher value live market in the U.S. and other markets (provided, of course, it meets the minimum size requirements).
By contrast, U.S. effort and catches are highest in the immediate post-moult period when lobster quality is at its lowest.
About half of the lobster goes to the lower end of the live market, depressing prices for harvesters but setting up a buying opportunity for Gulf of St. Lawrence plants wishing to extend their processing season.
The current Canadian approach to setting seasons appears to serve conservation and market needs very well.
Industry cost structure:
The cost structures of the harvesting sectors are broadly similar.
The respective lobster fleets are composed of similar sized vessels (most under 45’), mostly operating within a few hours of their home ports and using more or less identical gear.
The rationale for vessel restrictions in Canada may be found in the desire to limit effort while also providing a measure of equity in the fishing opportunity (trap limits also help in this respect).
There would appear to be no sound reason for disturbing the current restrictions, particularly since the more relaxed U.S. approach does not appear to confer any competitive advantage on harvesters there.
The Canadian and U.S. fleets operate under the same owner-operator principles.
The shore price paid by shippers and processors (after buyer commissions) accounts for 80-85% of the cost of sales.
This means that all other factors (e.g., fees, labour and other operating costs) contribute just 15-20%.
Strong competition for raw material accounts for the relatively high shore prices.
The perennial risk is paying too much for raw material and then undercutting competitors to gain sales.
Eliminating fleet separation would result in greater control over raw material supply and reduce the upward pressure on shore prices, thereby reducing the raw material share of cost of sales and improving shipper/processor margins.
Whether it would make the industry as a whole any more competitive in international markets is open to question.
In the absence of a coordinated selling approach, the higher margins could simply provide shippers and processors more room to undercut each other.
It suggests that both the live and processed segments of the industry suffer from excess capacity.
Most firms in the industry continue to be supply driven, bidding up the price of raw material in order to maximize capital utilization and extend the season as long as possible.
They cite variable and inconsistent auditing/inspections as the reason for instances of noncompliance.
They also fear industry-wide implications should product from noncompliant plants cause health problems in export markets.
CFIA, through consistent on-site audits of the production process and inspection of products, should ensure that all federally registered plants meet or exceed established QMP standards.

The Canadian Farmed Salmon Industry Benchmark Analysis for the US Market
Final Report
Prepared for:
Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada Ottawa, Ontario
Vancouver, BC In Association with:
Odd Grydeland Consulting Edna Lam Consulting Dr. James L. Anderson
Preface Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada retained GSGislason & Associates Ltd. to conduct a benchmarking study for Canadian farmed salmon.
This benchmarking study compares the performance of the Canadian farmed salmon industry against the performance of major competitors, the Norwegian and Chilean farmed salmon industries, in the US market.
Benchmarking is a management technique or tool that compares performance among organizations or business activities undertaking similar processes.
Benchmarking provides a standard against which industry performance can be measured.
Information Sources.
We did not conduct formal detailed financial surveys of the Canadian companies, for example in cooperation with an accounting firm, as this was beyond our Terms and Reference project scope and time and budget parameters.
Canadian Production and Exports to US.
Canada produced 109 thousand tonnes of farmed salmon in 2005 or 8% of the total world production of 1.3 million tonnes.
About 90% of both Canadian and world production was Atlantic salmon.
2005 Farmed Salmon Production ‘000 tonnes* Canada Chile Norway Other Total * wet fish equivalents
Benchmarking Results.
The first four can be called "Structural Issues, the latter one "Market Issues".
US market penetration – Canadian product has longer shelf life than Chilean product and receives a small price premium for this better quality; Canada finds producing whole fish more profitable than producing fillets; Norway essentially is excluded from the US whole fish market due to high tariffs Key Advantages & Disadvantages of Canadian Industry*
Advantage 1. proximity to US market
• high transportation cost advantage on perishable products
• farm site to customer within 48-72 hours possible 2. quality of product
• food safety 3. familiarity with US
• direct neighbours
• lack of federal/provincial harmonization
• counteract ENGO falsehoods
• market Canadian quality
• garner political & community support 3. higher input costs
• smolts, feed, labour
The first two disadvantages, in our opinion, can and should be addressed.
It is incumbent on government, with the constructive support of industry, to streamline the regulatory process and reduce the micromanaging of the aquaculture industry i.e., define reasonable performance standards and allow industry to determine the best way to meet and exceed them.
Regulatory reform is the gatekeeper to industry viability and growth.
There is a saying that "…uncertainty kills any business".
The third is a present "fact of life", but something that may become less significant as lake access for smolt rearing in Chile is restricted, feed formulations change worldwide, and productivity improvements are realized in Canada.
The Canadian advantage is most prominent in the delivery of high quality, gutted whole fish to the US market by truck.
This market segment is smaller and more specialized than the fillet market – other nations need to employ expensive air freight to access the US fresh salmon market e.g., it costs $1.80US/kg to fly fish from Chile to the US.
Canada can produce high quality by stunning and bleeding the salmon with low stress at the farm site, dead hauling the fish to the Canadian plant where it is gutted prior to rigor, transporting the gutted whole fish to a US cheap labour facility where the fish, now out of rigor, can be cut into fillets or portions to exact customer requirements.
This results in the ultimate freshness and shelf life to the end customer.
And this quality advantage can extract a price premium.
Although producing fresh whole fish is our competitive advantage today, we do not recommend that Canadian industry produce only this product.
Some Canadian producers have developed profitable niche markets for fresh fillets, skewers or portions.
These markets should continue to be cultivated.
Moreover, producing a variety of products reduces market risk – the market is capricious and can change rapidly.

The Canadian aquaculture industry of today and the business environment in which it operates is very different from that of 10 to 15 years ago.
World aquaculture production has tripled, the influence of the environmental movement has escalated, and consumer tastes and demand have shifted.
Other changes relate to the effects of globalization, through the liberalization of trade, greater capital mobility, and technological advances in transportation, communications, and other services.
From an economic perspective, national boundaries are essentially being erased.
As a result, the Canadian aquaculture industry faces increased competition as well as increased opportunities.
Very large food discounters and large food broadliners selling a variety of foodstuffs have emerged.
These companies source food from around the world and exert enormous influence on markets.
There also has been dramatic consolidation in food retailing internationally.
These changes confer increased power to the food distribution and retail sector, and decreased power to food manufacturers.
The result is severe price pressure on margins for food manufacturing.
The aquaculture sector in Canada faces various constraints – from a lack of industry cohesion in some subsectors to inflexible government regulation to inadequate attention to consumer needs – that hinder adaptation to the new global business conditions.
There is both a compelling need and substantial potential for industry and government to significantly enhance industry’s long-term viability.
The Seafood Value Chain Roundtable process launched by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) has the goal of increasing the value, competitiveness and economic viability of the seafood sector in Canada.
This study is one of a series of benchmarking studies aimed at comparing the structure and market position of the Canadian aquaculture industry against major competitors.
Overview of Competitive Position, Part B:
The responses of each industry interviewee addressed at least one of the three components e.g., all did not provide cost of production or benchmark scores (many were not aware of operations in other countries).
We also developed a separate one page guide for our interviews with brokers/marketers/ distributors.
The information in the report is presented at an aggregate level to preserve confidentiality.

Farmed salmon are reared from the egg stage to a market-sized product.
Akin to other livestock industries such as beef and poultry, the salmon farming industry can expand production to the limit of market demand, assuming sufficient access to suitable marine environments and technology.
• Hatchery phase – the birthing and rearing of Atlantic salmon from broodstock eggs to smolt in a freshwater environment (normally a period of 12 to 18 months).
Growout phase – the rearing and feeding of salmon smolts in sea cages to market size, i.e., "farming" (normally a further 16 to 24 month period).
Processing – the harvesting and processing of grown fish into gutted head-on product or further-processed (i.e., value-added) steaks, fillets, portions etc.
(including packaging and transport to consumer).
The fish are usually shipped in Styrofoam containers each containing 22 kg (50 lbs.) of product.
Not all of the above hatchery, growth, processing, and sales functions are performed by salmon farming companies.
In other words, the industry encompasses more than just the companies involved in the growout function.

Major Companies.
There was a major consolidation of salmon farming operations on both coasts in 2005.
In BC, Marine Harvest acquired Stolt Seafarms and Mainstream acquired Heritage Salmon.
In New Brunswick, Cooke Aquaculture acquired the NB operations of both Stolt and Heritage.
Today the major companies are:
East Coast Admiral Aqua Fish Barry Group Cooke Aquaculture West Coast Creative Salmon Grieg Seafood Mainstream Marine Harvest Pan Fish* Target Marine
* Pan Fish recently purchased Marine Harvest
Cooke, Aqua Fish and Admiral operate in both New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
The Barry Group is a recent venture in Newfoundland.
Cooke Aquaculture comprises well over half the East Coast industry in terms of production.
All the East Coast companies listed are Canadian-owned.
Mainstream and Pan Fish as well as Grieg have Norwegian parent companies – these companies grow salmon all over the world e.g., Norway, Chile, Scotland, Faroe Islands.
Target Marine is Canadian-owned.
Creative Salmon, a smaller company, produces only chinook salmon and has some Japanese ownership.
Sales and Exports.
The East Coast suffers from cold winter temperatures exacerbated by very large tidal fluctuations.
This can lead to sea water temperatures below zero ("superchill"), which can lead to fish kills.
Low winter temperatures cause drops in feeding rates, and thus the production time to harvest size is longer.
Harvest size can be lower on the East Coast as well.
The East Coast produces almost exclusively Atlantic salmon (a small amount of steelhead is produced in Newfoundland).
BC produces chinook, coho, steelhead as well as Atlantics –chinook and coho are species indigenous to the northern Pacific Ocean.
Genetic Stocks.
BC has brought in genetic material from the East Coast, Scotland, Ireland and most recently Iceland (the latter from land-based broodstock programs).
The most popular stock is the Mowi stock- originally brought in from the Fanad Hatchery in Ireland.
The Mowi stock is characterized by fast growth and late maturation.
Most East Coast processing plants are located inland, making it necessary to transport harvest fish by truck from a dock.
This has led to a cumbersome and inefficient process of killing the fish and transporting the fish to the plant.
In BC most plants processing farmed salmon are situated on the water, and some have holding pens where large, modern well-boats can off-load the fish at any time of night and day.
This enables the plant to maximize plant capacity without staff overtime.
Most processing plants in BC also have a higher capacity than East Coast ones.
Feed deliveries in BC are almost always made by barges that supply the feed in bulk (1-2 tonne bags).
Centralized, computer-controlled feeding systems have been the norm in BC for a long time, and have been adopted more frequently on the East Coast in recent years.
Fish Health.
East Coast farmers in New Brunswick have an on-going problem with Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA), a viral disease that is difficult to control or eradicate.
Kudoa Thyrsites ("Kudoa") is a parasite that attacks the muscle tissue of the fish host and results in soft tissue that reduces their market acceptance.
BC farmers had a significant Kudoa problem several years ago, but have not experienced problems lately.
East Coast producers have not had Kudoa issues, but have experienced "soft flesh" issues from other causes at certain times of the year.
Ownership/Financing.
After the recent restructuring, well over half of the East Coast industry is owned by one Canadian company, Cooke Aquaculture.
Further consolidation could occur as some East Coast companies appear financially fragile.
The main BC companies comprise part of international salmon farming enterprises – they are financially stable, after a period of restructuring.
They would have the resources necessary to grow the business, should the conditions (political, regulatory, market) be deemed supportive.
Pan Fish and Mainstream are the two largest salmon farming companies in the world.
Licensing/Governance.
Provincial/local governments on the East Coast have historically been very supportive of aquaculture development.
The federal ACOA program has also provided much financial support to the sector, whereas the federal counterpart in BC, Western Diversification, has been much less active in aquaculture.
Recent developments in BC have put the previously supportive provincial government into a wait-and-see mode, with yet another review initiative announced recently (the Special Committee on Sustainable Aquaculture).
On-going assaults from ENGOs in the region keep the BC industry from reaching its full potential due to the resulting lack of political support.
In addition, First Nations issues are much more visible in BC than on the East Coast.
The requirement for consultations with First Nations on licensing issues, as a result of recent court decisions, has impeded the timely issuance/reissuance of tenures.
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland salmon farming companies are represented by a broad-based (finfish and shellfish) aquaculture association in each province.
The Terms of Reference for this study asked that we benchmark the performance of the Canadian industry – both structurally and in the US marketplace – against one or more major competitors.
For this study we chose to benchmark Canadian performance against that of Norway and Chile, the two largest farmed salmon producing nations in the world.
Chile is the dominant supplier of farmed salmon to the US market.
Benchmarking is a management technique or tool that compares performance among organizations or business activities undertaking similar processes.
Benchmarking provides a standard against which industry performance can be measured or judged.
Benchmarking asks and answers questions such as:
Who is the best?
Who sets the standards?
Where do our competitors stand?
Benchmarking provides a tool to compare your operation to the results – production and financial – of the industry at large.
The intent is to identify gaps in performance to be bridged by improvements.
In essence, benchmarking provides the ability to learn from others and to adopt "best practices".
In today’s increasing competitive environment, with the onslaught of globalization, benchmarking is an invaluable tool for continuous improvements.
Benchmarking for this Study.
Proper benchmarking requires a thorough knowledge of one’s own industry before a comparison can be made to competitors.
Unfortunately, existing profile information on the Canadian farmed salmon industry is incomplete, inconsistent across regions, and/or misleading.
In a real sense, it is premature to benchmark the Canadian industry.
Nevertheless, we made a concerted effort to address information gaps for the Canadian industry as well as to profile the Norwegian and Chilean industries.
This required a substantial interview program and secondary data collection process.
But we did not conduct formal detailed financial surveys of the Canadian companies, for example in cooperation with an accounting firm, as this was beyond our Terms of Reference, project scope and time and budget parameters.
The results of our benchmarking investigations are summarized in Exhibit 3 and discussed in the remainder of this section under five (5) major headings:
•
•
•
•
• biophysical capability, regulatory environment, operations, input costs & financing, and US market penetration
The subsequent discussion focuses on the key benchmark elements.

The Norwegian coast (59-71°N) is unusually warm due to the Gulf Current that comes up from the Gulf of Mexico and helps keep temperatures moderate in the winter.
Likewise, the Humboldt Current, originating near the Antarctic Peninsula, keeps the sea water along the southern coast of Chile (41-55°S) at a moderate and suitable level throughout the year (seldom over 15°C in the summer).
These conditions, like those in BC (48-55°N) are close to ideal for salmon production.
A report from the late 1990s suggested that British Columbia has the biophysical capability to expand farmed salmon production five-fold or more to 200,000 + tonnes annually (Coopers & Lybrand 1997) – and production since that time has doubled so there is still significant potential for further expansion.
A high percentage of coastline on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, North Vancouver Island/Broughton Archipelago, Central Coast and North Coast meet good aquaculture siting criteria for both shellfish and finfish.
The South Coast Bay D’Espoir area of Newfoundland also has substantial potential for salmon farming (the water in the area does not freeze in winter) – it has been suggested that Newfoundland has the biophysical capability to produce 25,000 + tonnes of farmed salmon annually.
In contrast, there is much more limited potential for growth in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, the former because existing Bay of Fundy development is near maximum and the latter because of competing resource user conflicts e.g., commercial fishing on the Southwest.
Chile and BC have had incidents of serious fish losses due to plankton blooms.
While losses have occurred in Norway and on the East Coast of Canada, they have not had as severe an impact as in BC and in Chile.
Invasive Species/Predation.
None of the three countries have had serious problems with invasive species and/or predation.
Predation by marine mammals has been more of a problem in Canada and Chile than in Norway, but protective measures taken, such as stronger nets and predator netting, have been effective (Norwegian and Canadian farmers are allowed to kill seals that damage farmed fish).
All three countries have on-going problems with viral diseases- ISA in Norway and New Brunswick, IPN in Norway and Chile, and IHN in BC.
Chile also has high rates of mortality due to Rickettsia, a bacterial disease without an effective vaccine.
Until recently, Norway has considered ISA as an exotic disease to be controlled by eradication.
Under a new policy, the development of a vaccine is expected to gain renewed attention.
In BC a new, DNA-based vaccine against IHN is being tried in a large field experiment.
Canada has recently introduced a National Aquatic Animal Health Program (NAAHP) that incorporates the on-going monitoring of both farmed and wild fish species.
This is anticipated to lead to the classification and quantification of fish pathogens in wild species in advance of these pathogens affecting farmed species.
The relationships between the Federal Government and the Provinces are regulated through a series of Memorandum of Understanding or MOUs.
The two levels of government are working to clarify roles and renew governance approaches under a series of Aquaculture Framework Agreements (AFAs).
It is anticipated that these AFAs will go a long way towards harmonizing the regulatory regimes for aquaculture between the Federal and Provincial governments, and thereby will streamline the decision-making process between the two levels of government (many observors view the lack of harmonized regulations between federal and provincial governments as the single greatest impediment to industry development).
While it is envisioned that these AFAs will be established based on a set of national criteria, there will be regional differences.
The main Federal Department dealing with aquaculture in Canada is the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) through the administration of the Fisheries Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.
These are acts of general application and none of these acts have specific mention of aquaculture.
DFO also conducts research in order to develop science-based regulations and management regimes.
There is a difference between the way federal regulations and policy are administered among the different provinces (although our interviews suggested that the gap has narrowed over the past 2 years as DFO in Eastern Canada has taken a much greater interest in aquaculture).
The Department of Transport (Transport Canada) is required to issue permits for fish farms under the Navigable Waters Protection Act, which triggers the need for an environmental assessment under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA).
The CEAA process for fish farms is undertaken by a Transport Canada screening under CEAA with DFO advice.
This also requires consultation with the aboriginal communities in the vicinity of the fish farm.
This has led to a virtual stand-still of site applications and renewals in BC as there seems to be no federal guidelines or directives regarding the extent of First Nations consultation required.
DFO also regulates the importation and transport of live fish and genetic material, and is responsible in general terms for fish health issues under the Introduction and Transfers Code.
The newly established National Aquatic Animal Health Program (NAAHP) is also designed to provide additional protection of aquatic animals against the harmful effects of diseases.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is responsible for the management and regulation of processing and packing plants under the Fish Inspection Act and the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act.
The CFIA has not yet approved the use of ozonated water as a seafood treatment mechanism – many other countries such as US have approved the use of ozonated water.

The Canadian Farmed Salmon Industry Benchmark Analysis for the US Market
The Provinces issue land tenures and are responsible for environmental issues such as waste management.
The Undersecretariat is responsible for policy making and the drafting of laws and regulations.
The National Fisheries Service is responsible for enforcement and data base compilations.
It sets standards for Environmental Impact Assessments, allowable production levels at farms, discharge limitations and pollution prevention requirements.
A National Aquaculture Registry is maintained in Chile, with information about: 1) Licence Holders (identity, address), 2) Number of licences held, 3) Location of farms with surface and geographical description (coordinates), and 4) List of licenced species and authorized installations.
In conclusion, Norway and Chile have a streamlined "single window" federal regulatory process for aquaculture which gives these two countries a substantial competitive advantage over Canada.
Canadian CEOs spend a lot of time and energy on regulatory issues to the detriment of other pressing matters.
As one CEO said to us: … we want a stable, even playing field that we can understand.
The ongoing Aquaculture Framework Agreement discussions in Canada offer the promise of harmonization and streamlining of regulations.
Siting.
Norway and Chile do not require licence/tenure renewal i.e., there is no time limit on licences.
BC requires an annual renewal of aquaculture licences while tenures are usually issued for a 5-25 year period.
First Nations consultations are a key part of the CEAA application/renewal process in Canada, especially BC.
Norway has a NOK 5 million Concession Fee (about $800,000 US) and a NOK 12,000 (about $2,000 US) application fee for a new licence – Chile has neither.
There are approximately 2,400 registered sites for salmon farming in Norway.
Norway has establishment, operation, and disease preventive measures for smolt farms e.g., maximum of 2.5 million smolts per site, minimum of 0.3 litres water/kg fish/minute.
The three countries all have disease monitoring, record keeping and reporting requirements.
Norway has both private and public veterinary services, Canada (BC) has mostly private vets, whereas Chile has almost exclusively private vets.
Norway requires routine visits by veterinarians whereas BC is governed by Fish Health Management Plans (FHMP) with vets used as required.
Norway, Chile and New Brunswick have eradication policies for diseases like ISA.
Norway has a legal requirement for generation separation, Chile does not.
Canada (BC) practices separation, but it is not a legal requirement (usually specified in a company’s FHMP).
New Brunswick also practices separation.
Environmental Issues.
All three countries require environmental monitoring.
Norway and Canada, both Eastern Canada and BC, require sea lice monitoring but Chile does not.
Norway, Chile and BC require reporting of escapes (but Eastern Canada does not).
All three countries regulate waste from salmon farming operations.
Chile prohibits anaerobic conditions under farm sites – when such conditions do occur, the operator must adjust the production volume.
Norway requires a waste permit.
Canada has various forms of performancebased standards, meaning that a farm can have a maximum level of impact (usually based on a set of chemical parameters) under or near the farm.
All countries prohibit the escape of farmed salmon, and Canada and Norway have imposed minimum net strength standards that call for stronger nets for use in larger cages.
There are no restrictions on cage size or number of fish per cage outside the maximum density requirements as stated above.
BC’s producers of Atlantic salmon have an advantage within serious scientific circles over Norway and the East Coast of Canada since their progeny can not produce viable off-springs from mating with local, Pacific salmon.
The industry has so far not been able to capitalize on this advantage.
Trade Issues.
There are no tariffs on Canadian farmed salmon products.
Norway does not.
Exhibit 5 summarizes benchmarks for operations in the three countries.
Genetic Stock.
BC uses primarily the good performing Mowi stock but Eastern Canada is restricted to the single St. John River stock due to the concern of genetic dilution of wild Atlantic salmon from escaped farm fish of "exotic" origin.
BC has only one advanced breeding program, a program owned by Mainstream.
Norway and Chile have access to premium stocks from a number of sophisticated fish breeding programs (with Chile always being one generation behind Norway when using imported eggs from Norway).
Mortality Up to Harvest.
All three countries typically use the 10% mortality rate benchmark.
Norway usually performs better than this and Chile is worse.
Farm mortality is higher in Chile in part because lake rearing of smolts fosters vulnerability to disease.
(Chile has no effective vaccine against the bacterial disease Rickettsia (SRS) although much research is underway to rectify this).
Logistics/Transportation and Services.
There is good infrastructure in Norway e.g., road, ferry and communication systems.
Chilean farms are located far from Santiago from where most of the product is shipped to export markets (most processing occurs also a fair distance from the new production sites).
Access to Skilled Workers.
Chile has problems finding good middle-level workers (site managers etc.) but has good plant workers.
Fish farming is a respected industry in Norway and attracts wellqualified individuals planning to make a career of the industry.
Farm Workers Live in Camp?
In BC, almost all farm sites are located on remote locations necessitating the operation of camps with workforce rotations.
The farm site in Norway is left unattended on weekends with fish fed using automated feeding systems.
Chilean farms also operate a camp with workforce rotation.
The trend in BC is to stun and bleed at the farm site but this requires delivery to the plant and processing within 20-24 hours before rigor sets in.
Dead hauling to the plant is cheaper and the fish is better quality so long as it is slaughtered gently.
Processing Techniques.
All countries have access to the same processing technology – but you need 4,000 to 5,000 tonnes of plant throughput annually before automated processing equipment is cost effective (some Canadian plants do not meet this threshold).
Generally Norwegian and Chilean plants are new and process greater volumes annually than do Canadian plants.
New Brunswick plants are situated off the water necessitating inefficient truck transport of fish from the dock to the processing plant.
Exhibit 6 presents representative costs of production for fresh whole and fresh fillet Atlantic salmon into the US markets from Canada, Norway, and Chile in 2004.
The intent is to convey the essence of the cost structure of US imports from competing sources rather than to estimate precisely the Cost of Production.
* estimates based on interviews and literature review (costs are before freight, processing, packaging, selling costs & farm-level capital costs).
The results suggest that:
• Fresh whole – Norway and Chile are not viable suppliers to the US market (Norway because of tariff and high air freight costs, Chile because of high air freight costs) – Canada is the only viable supplier of the three
• Fresh fillets – Chile is the most competitive supplier, in spite of high air freight costs, due to much cheaper processing costs (filleting is labour intensive and Chile has cheap labour) – Canadian producers receive better returns from selling whole fish rather than fillets to the US market Following is a discussion of some of the key input cost parameters.

Smolt Rearing.
Chile has a substantial advantage in that most of their smolts are lake-reared, a very cheap rearing method (although access to lake rearing will be curtailed in the future).
BC has only a few lake rearing locations, New Brunswick has none.
Chile and Norway both have access to premium stocks from sophisticated breeding programs.
Feed.
Norway has been slow to replace fish meal and oil components by a vegetable component, but gets good Feed Conversion Ratios (FCRs).
Canada has ready access to non-marine ingredients.
Chile is close to production facilities in fish meal and oil.
Wage Rates.
Wage rates in Canada are substantially higher than in Chile but lower than in Norway.
International Manufacturing Hourly Compensation 2004 ($US) Canada $21.42
Norway UK France US Japan New Zealand Taiwan Hong Kong Chile China
US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Wage rates in US non-unionized food processing plants would be well under $20 US per hour.

Customer Trends.
Canadian farmed salmon is one of a variety of protein sources for "centre of the plate", namely: 1) red and white meat protein, 2) other seafood, and 3) other farmed salmon.
Today’s customer is looking for health benefits, food safety, and convenience as well as the traditional attributes of taste and value.
Some specific trends are:
• more convenience, portion control, meal-ready heat & serve items
• increasingly frozen portions and other value-added foodservice (with less trained kitchen staff)
• increasing focus on nutrition and health benefits of seafood e.g., beneficial fish oils such as omega 3
• more people eating out Farmed salmon is well-positioned to deliver what the consumer wants.
As a result, farmed salmon imports to the US have increased dramatically over the past 15 years (see Exhibit 1, Section 1).
Farmed salmon is the biggest seller in the fresh seafood counters of retail stores in the US.
Quality.
The quality of farmed salmon as it leaves the waters of farms in Canada, Chile, and Norway is very good.
However, there can be noticeable differences in quality as the product reaches the US market, primarily related to distance.
Canada’s proximity to the US allows the US customer to receive it within 2-3 days by truck from leaving the farm site.
Much greater distances within Chile, from the farm site to the main Santiago distribution point, and between Chile and the main US transhipment point of Miami means that the Chilean product is 3-4 days older even if air freighted i.e., Canada has a 3-4 day shelf life advantage over Chile.
It appears that the gap has essentially disappeared today i.e., there have been significant improvements in the Chilean food regulatory regime.
All three countries – Canada, Norway, and Chile – have good food safety programs.
Fresh vs. Value-Added.
Chile originally produced mainly fresh whole fish for the US market but transformed itself to producing almost exclusively fillets, portions, etc. due to air freight issues, both high costs plus the difficulty of actually getting space i.e., "lift".
There has been high demand in the US for fillets and portions and the demand has fueled the rapid growth of Chilean imports (Exhibit 7).
In the 1990s Canada started to export more value-added fillets and portions as well – but recently has started to retrench somewhat back to fresh whole fish.
The reasons are complex, but include:
• wage rates – the lower wages in the US can make it attractive for a BC company to ship whole fish to the US where it can be filleted at less cost.
"There is a climate of excitement around seafood".
"Farmed salmon is a commodity, a staple and is the biggest seller in the fresh seafood counter".
"Canadian salmon is preferred for its texture and taste".
"The West Coast Canadian suppliers can’t seem to supply the D and E trim fillets we want.
Fillets and portions are in high demand".
"The Product of Canada label still has caché".
"The price for Canadian whole fish is set by the market price for frozen Chilean fillets".
"The shelf life of Canadian product is better due to proximity to market".
"California with their migrant labour can cut cheaper than BC".
"We spend a minimal amount of money marketing our product compared to pork".
"Most companies have sales offices, not marketers".
"The Canadian government is focussed on regulating the industry – the Norwegian and Chilean governments are focussed on promoting the industry".
"Marketing should be done to differentiate Canadian salmon from others.
Canada has done nothing to promote the Canadian origin of fish".
"On the West Coast big retailers such as Fred Meyer, Albertsons and Safeway buy from retail distributors – on the East Coast big retailers buy from salmon companies directly".
"The Canadian industry needs to provide better communication and information to neutralize extreme factors of the ENGO movement – consumers need to be educated".
"Sustainability and competitiveness go hand in hand".
"Nobody can take on the Chileans for frozen in North America".
"Frozen products are gaining in popularity, can be of excellent quality, although fresh fish still has a reputation of being better.
Prepared portions – ready to eat – are emerging.
Chile will be producing less fresh product due to the increasing cost of freight as a result of climbing oil prices".
"BC needs to do a better job with PR, provide point-of-sale material.
You need to fight false information, and create stories about the health benefits of eating seafood that is produced in an environmentally sound manner".
The price of farmed salmon has fallen over the past 10 years with the dramatic increase in world supply (Exhibit 1, Section 1).
Farmed salmon has become a commodity – like protein.
Urner Barry, December 2005
Exchange Rates.
The export price of all three countries have been hurt by stronger currencies since 2002 – but the Chilean peso has strengthened to a greater extent than the Canadian or New Zealand dollar (see Exhibit B.4, Appendix B).
Marketing Approaches.
Canadian producers have marketed their products individually and, in the case of a BC companies operating in other parts of the world, under the worldwide company name and logo.
This Benchmarking study has compared the performance of the Canadian farmed salmon industry, both structurally and in the US marketplace, against major competitors of Norway and Chile.
Each country does certain things better, and some things worse, than the other two.
• greater shelf life
• water quality
• food safety 3. familiarity with US
• direct neighbours
• lack of federal/provincial harmonization
• prevents access to new sites, economies of scale
• health benefits of seafood
• counteract ENGO falsehoods
• market Canadian quality
• garner political & community support 3. higher input costs
Regulatory certainty is a paramount issue for the Canadian farmed salmon industry.
Industry should address the second major disadvantage, the communication challenge.
We believe that there is a major opportunity to educate the consumer, the community and the general public as to the health, community development and sustainability benefits of Canadian farmed salmon.
This market segment is smaller and more specialized than the fillet market – other nations need to employ expensive air freight to access the US fresh salmon market.
The US fresh fillet market could be much more attractive for Canadian producers in the future than it is today.

Round Pounds vs. Finished Pounds The Product Mix for Fraser Sockeye About "Terminal" Fraser Sockeye FINANCIAL RESULTS Getting the Most From Every Pound… Growing the Harvest Financial Results – Summary REBUILDING THE FRASER RIVER SOCKEYE BUSINESS Considerations Underlying a Strategy A Vision of the Fraser Sockeye Business Closing Observation APPENDIX 1:
The infrastructure supported by Fraser River sockeye – seine, gillnet and troll fleets, processing companies, and service businesses - has withered as well.
As the stature and financial health of businesses reliant on Fraser River sockeye has deteriorated, the competitive environment facing seafood participants has grown increasingly difficult and complex.
Globalization, the growth of aquaculture, a strengthening Canadian dollar, and skyrocketing energy costs are among the macro forces necessitating that BC seafood players conduct their business intelligently and effectively in order to survive and compete.
The Fraser River sockeye fishery is much-discussed and dissected from run-size, fishery management, and allocation perspectives.
This discourse is often subjective and there is considerable friction amongst stakeholders.
The business side of the fishery tends to be neglected, yet objective business analysis provides one path toward motivating stakeholders to work toward the common goal of maximizing the value of the available harvest.
This paper, commissioned by the Seafood Value Chain Roundtable, and prepared by Stuart Nelson of Nelson Bros Fisheries Ltd under the direction of the BC Seafood Alliance, examines the Fraser River sockeye fishery from a business perspective.
The focus of this paper is to provide information and analysis to pave the way for improvements in business performance.
The Assignment This report provides objective and quantitative analysis of the current and potential business performance of the Fraser River sockeye fishery.
Among the activities and objectives of this project:
• Compare the Fraser River with benchmark sockeye fisheries in Alaska.
Show how fish quality influences product form flexibility.
Provide education for stakeholders.
Recommendations.
A tenet of the Value Chain Roundtable, which commissioned this study, is that commercial fisheries should be managed to maximize value to stakeholders.
While every Fraser River sockeye fishery stakeholder may hold a different view on how to "fix" their fishery, this paper strives to provide a business framework, a common denominator, for assessing opportunities for improvement to a currently under-achieving business.
Approach There is no simple means of compiling financial information on the Fraser River sockeye fishery.
In completing the study, a variety of information sources were tapped:
From information gathered, a financial model was developed to describe and predict financial performance of the Fraser River sockeye fishery.
The financial model, when fed with reasonable assumptions, is an objective tool for evaluating the effectiveness of various strategies and scenarios.
Not In This Paper… A host of important issues have combined to impact the fishery and contributed to bringing it to its current diminished state.
These include:
Illegal fishing.
Fraser River Sockeye Salmon Benchmark Study
Whether fishery management responses to changing environmental, conservation, legal, and political conditions have been fitting is highly subjective, and outside the terms of reference of this study.
For the purposes of this study, it is sufficient to acknowledge that the constraints to mounting "industrial scale" commercial fisheries on Fraser sockeye runs have grown considerably in recent years.
Less sockeye is available for commercial harvest now than in the past.
Background Before considering current and prospective Fraser River sockeye fishery information, it is prudent to provide a brief narrative of where the fishery has come from in the recent past, and where it stands today.
Until the mid-1990’s wild salmon was the dominant BC commercial fishery, and the Fraser River sockeye fishery was the pre-eminent salmon fishery on the coast.
The financial performance of south coast fishing vessels, including seine, gillnet, and troll fleets, was strongly influenced by the size of the Fraser sockeye harvest and prices paid for the catch.
Similarly, a sizeable processing sector relied on Fraser sockeye to underwrite volumes and revenues.
Beginning in the late 1980s, BC salmon participants saw declining values for pink and chum salmon, related to high catches in other jurisdictions and the market impacts of the growing salmon aquaculture industry.
A lesser financial contribution from pinks and chums meant a greater reliance on sockeye – particularly Fraser River sockeye.
Seafood Value Chain Roundtable
Fraser River Sockeye Salmon Benchmark Study Through the 1990s changing ocean conditions resulted in dramatically lower harvest levels for pink and chum salmon in the north and central coasts.
Results were also sobering: the over-reliance of the industry on Fraser sockeye was never more apparent (what if the run had failed?) and the massive fishing pressure placed on the resource by the fleet left no margin for fishery management error.
The 1994 fishing season demonstrated both the spectacular economic potential of the Fraser River sockeye fishery, and the unhealthy degree to which industry had grown dependent upon it.
The following seasons saw diminished access to coho and chinook ("coho crisis," inter-sectoral allocations) for the commercial fleets, rendering Fraser sockeye dependency even more acute.
The most recent (2005) Fraser sockeye season saw a commercial harvest of 128,000 fish with an estimated ex-vessel value of about $1.5 million and a wholesale value in the $2.5 million range.
The economic scale of the 2005 fishery was about 1/100th of that seen in 1994.
Given that the BC fishing industry was over-reliant on the Fraser River sockeye fishery in the 1990’s, and that the fishery has declined so precipitously, it should not be surprising that stakeholders have undergone dramatic economic and social adjustments in the ensuing years.
The number of salmon fishing vessels has been more than halved through fleet rationalization mechanisms (government funded buyback, licence stacking), and a number of processors have exited the business.
Remaining fishermen and processing companies have necessarily reduced costs and diversified into other fisheries and activities.
Today, the Fraser River sockeye fishery is largely an opportunistic activity for stakeholders; they do not rely on it, and do not build it into their annual business plans.
New investment in the fishery has not been justified, in fact there has been significant dis-investment.
Any remaining infrastructure is in place to exploit other fishery opportunities (other BC salmon, Alaskan salmon, or other species).
As stated earlier, the purpose of this paper is not to assign blame for circumstances in the Fraser River sockeye fishery, but rather to promote improvements in the business performance of the fishery.
From a business perspective, the plight of the Fraser River sockeye fishery could be attributed to the following:
Essentially, stakeholders in the Fraser River sockeye have been sidelined at a time when global competitors have been extremely active.
The business has grown more challenging and competitive, at the same time as Fraser River stakeholders have been shedding infrastructure, seeking alternative sources of income, and squabbling amongst themselves over catch shares and levels.
Competitive Developments in the Seafood Industry The competitive environment facing not just sockeye salmon producers, but wild salmon and other capture-fishery seafood participants worldwide, has grown increasingly challenging in recent years.
Developments
• Growth of aquaculture – the impacts of aquaculture on wild seafood producers are profound.
Aquaculture offers consumers large volumes, consistent availability of highquality fresh product, and low price levels.
Farmed products displace wild ones, and offer a growing number of alternatives to traditional products (e.g. basa, tilapia, catfish).
Aquaculture producers enjoy distinct advantages over capture fishery producers, as they do not face the inherent uncertainties associated with resource abundance and catch levels.
Aquaculture is, to say the least, a formidable competitor for the capture-fishery sector.
Ignoring (or opposing) aquaculture does nothing to mitigate its effects on the wild seafood business.
Producers have been forced to develop markets elsewhere, often for lower prices.
Twice-frozen seafood has gained (unwitting) consumer acceptance, so fish can be frozen near the location of capture, shipped to China, thawed for reprocessing, re-frozen, shipped to market (anywhere in the
Wild fisheries ignoring this trend will imperil the marketability of their products.
Consumer inclination toward "wild" seafood – in some markets, particularly North America and Europe, there has been a backlash of sorts against aquaculture, specifically farmed salmon.
Wild seafood has been granted a window to regain at least a portion of lost market share.
Health and safety standards – always rigorous, the "bar" for seafood meeting the health and safety standards of key markets is ever-rising.
Seafood destined for export must be produced according to stringent protocols and finished product must meet high standards.
It is no longer enough to produce high-quality seafood; a costly documentation-trail describing the production process in fine detail must also be produced.
Currency exchange rates – with seafood traded liberally around the world, producers are greatly affected by fluctuating currency exchange rates.
Canadian dollar strength relative to the yen and U.S. dollar has meant a sharp decline in prices realized for exports of Canadian seafood products.
Seafood Value Chain Roundtable March, 2006
• Rising energy costs – as the cost of crude oil and diesel fuel has escalated in the last couple of years, the cost of fishing has risen, too.
They make participants long for the "good old days."
Margin Squeeze The financial effect of competitive developments in the seafood industry is simple to describe: downward pressure on revenues, upward pressure on costs, resulting in lower margins.
Why should we change when it’s not our fault?
For Fraser River stakeholders, the most obvious change they have observed is a drastic reduction in harvest levels and precious-little fishing activity in the last eight years.
It is understandable that they focus on harvest volumes, and believe (hope?) that restored volumes will bring acceptable financial results.
Fraser River sockeye salmon participants often envy their counterparts in Alaska, where runs of all species of salmon are healthy, catches are strong, and fisheries management is touted as "world class."
Benchmark Sockeye Fisheries - Alaska Alaskan sockeye fisheries represent the largest supply of sockeye salmon in the world.
Despite strong stocks, however, Alaska’s sockeye fishery participants have experienced business challenges, and developed strategic responses, that may be instructive to commercial Fraser River sockeye stakeholders.
Following are snapshots of three key Alaskan sockeye fisheries:
Copper River, Chignik, and Bristol Bay.
In each of these benchmark fisheries, the problems, processes leading to change, and results, are highly involved and complex.
The details are necessarily glossed-over in this brief analysis.
Copper River Situation Copper River is a gillnet sockeye fishery in the Prince William Sound area of Alaska’s Central Region.
The average annual harvest is around 1.5 million sockeye.
The timing of the Copper River sockeye run is unusually early.
Typically, early-season fisheries suffer from high operating costs, as assets do not reach full utilization.
In the 1980’s, a group of gillnetters recognized that timing of the Copper River sockeye run presented a potential marketing angle – "first sockeye of the season" – and that a marketing edge might offset these cost disadvantages.
Fraser River Sockeye Salmon Benchmark Study
Response The Copper River Fishermen’s Coop established a brand name for the region’s fish, and began an education and training program to instil a quality fish-handling ethic amongst harvesters.
The initiative attracted considerable fishermen-support and a sizeable marketing budget.
Results Copper River is now a widely recognized brand name (for which there is a patent pending).
Thanks to clever regional marketing, North American consumers now equate "Copper River" with "premium quality."
When the first fresh Copper River sockeye hits the market each spring, restaurants and retailers actively promote the product, and customers pay premium prices.
The early portion of the harvest is typically air-freighted around the globe.
The Copper River quality and marketing campaign establishes a high-value niche for sockeye salmon, a consumer awareness that can benefit sockeye from other fisheries as well.
The marketing frenzy accompanying the "first sockeye of the season" translates into attractive prices for harvesters – for the first portion of the catch.
The market size for "designer-priced" sockeye is finite, however, and as the season wears on and harvest volumes grow, prices return closer to commodity levels.
The Copper River branding initiative is evidence of the potential of marketing to develop awareness, differentiate products, and shape consumer perception.
Copper River sockeye is often regarded as the best sockeye on the market, even though its attributes are no different than those of many other sockeye stocks.
The industry recognized that strategies to improve revenues while reducing cost were necessary to ensure continued business viability.
In 2002, a Cooperative was formed, with 2
Results Under the Co-op, the number of vessels actively fishing has been dramatically reduced: about 20 vessels have harvested on behalf of 70, with revenues and expenses shared amongst all Co-op members.
The fishery has been spread out evenly over the period of the sockeye migration.
The Co-op has resulted in a number of positives from an economic perspective:
• A substantial reduction in fishing costs – fewer vessels fishing means lower total expenses.
While the Co-op fishery has allowed for improvements vs. the status quo, it has not been the salvation of the Chignik fishery, since both sockeye returns and market conditions have been weak since the Co-op’s inception.
• Reduction in fishing employment (fewer boats actively fishing means fewer crew jobs).
Shift in processing – from two major processors to one.
Strong opposition to the Co-op, on philosophical and legal grounds.
In February 2006, the Supreme Court of Alaska said that the Board of Fisheries did not have the authority to establish the Chignik Co-op under the Limited Entry Act.
Response Collectively, Bristol Bay sockeye producers have shifted their production emphasis from frozen to canned, and within the canned category, from "talls" to ½ and ¼ pound production.
This has required significant investment in plant and machinery, and penetration of non-traditional markets.
By executing a product-shift, Bristol Bay sockeye producers have preserved the marketability of their production, and values have risen slightly from the lows seen in the mid-1990’s.
They have diversified their product mix, and gained market share at the expense of competitors.
But Bristol Bay’s inroads into the ½ and ¼ pound markets have been gained mostly through pricing.
With a lower cost base than any competitor, Bristol Bay canners have been able to undercut the prices charged by their Canadian counterparts.
By paying relatively low ex-vessel fish prices, and through economies of scale accompanying high production levels, Bristol Bay producers
Fraser River Sockeye Salmon Benchmark Study enjoy a competitive advantage over producers of similar product forms.
Alaska Case Studies – Applicability to Fraser River The purpose of examining other jurisdictions is to gain perspectives pertinent to the task at hand: improving the business performance of the Fraser River sockeye fishery.
No Role Models… Unfortunately, none of the Alaskan sockeye fisheries – Copper River, Chignik, or Bristol Bay – comprise a role model for the Fraser River.
There is no simple recipe for success.
Each fishery is unique, with different challenges and a different group of stakeholders.
In each fishery certain business shortcomings have been recognized and addressed, but each still faces considerable further work to realize its full potential.
Lessons for the Fraser River Alaskan Fishery Positives Regional marketing can work – a brand image/product differentiation for "Copper River."
Marketing program can bring premium wholesale values and fish prices.
Industry working together to fulfill quality expectations.
Fishery reform to lay the foundation for business improvements: lower costs, improved quality, better service to markets, higher values.
Shifting product emphasis to ensure marketability of product.
Cautions
High-value niche markets have limitations… early volumes earn premiums, later catches earn "commodity" price.
Marketing program requires significant expenditures.
Addressing business issues does not bring "immunity" from resource and market conditions.
Implementation of reform without due process: buyin of entire industry, legal issues.
Failure to address the value side of the equation: intense competitive fishery with incentives to maximize volume, not value.
High Catch Levels Do Not Assure Success Three Alaskan sockeye fisheries with adequate harvest levels, all facing business crises related to markets and costs… this should prove instructive to Fraser River stakeholders who believe that if their fishery was restored to its former size then all economic problems would vanish.
Clearly, catch levels alone are not enough to ensure business success in the modern sockeye salmon fishery.
Indeed, high catch volumes can expose and exacerbate fundamental business weaknesses.
Healthy catches may even obscure the fact that business shortcomings exist - many Alaskan participants cling to the notion that, because their sockeye stocks are healthy, any business problems are either transitory, are someone else’s fault, or can be remedied by band-aid solutions.
The case studies demonstrate that Alaskan sockeye fishery participants have not fully embraced the need for fundamental change.
Consistent Catches are a Pre-requisite of Success While the sizeable annual Copper River, Chignik, and Bristol Bay sockeye catches do not guarantee success for stakeholders, they provide a critical foundation for business development.
Marketing programs, fishery reform, and productivity investments are futile without a solid production base underlying them.
Like their Alaskan counterparts, many Fraser River sockeye stakeholders fail to recognize the impact that shifting competitive conditions are having on their business, in part because the absence of a meaningful fishery means they do not have a functional business.
In this section, information specifically relating to Fraser River sockeye revenues and costs is provided.
• Fraser River the 2nd largest sockeye producing river system in the world; a factor in the scheme of world sockeye supply.
About half of Fraser sockeye canned into ¼ and ½ pound cansizes, primarily for the Canadian and United Kingdom markets; a combination of branded product (eg Cloverleaf, Gold Seal, Ocean’s) and private-label product.
Domestic market product generally sourced from BC sockeye fisheries.
A sizeable minority of production frozen in headed and gutted (h&g) form for export to Japan.
A buoyant Japanese economy (a bubble economy, unfortunately) and a strong affinity for sockeye made for a highly attractive market.
A very small amount of production allocated to other product forms and markets (eg. smoked).
The size of the Bristol Bay harvest was the primary determinant of both canned and frozen market price levels.
The majority of Bristol Bay production went in h&g form to Japan.
A large Bristol Bay pack meant long supply and downward pressure on prices.
While sockeye is still an important specie in the Japanese market, imports from Russia have increased.
The stature of Bristol Bay in the Japanese market has declined.
The demand – in terms of volume and price level – for sockeye has declined.
The attractiveness of the Japanese sockeye market has lessened substantially.
Contrary to popular belief, the canned salmon market is not shrinking, its size has remained remarkably constant.
Favoured product forms are fresh or frozen potions.
The growth in the North American sockeye market to-date is far less than the diminution suffered in the Japanese market.
North America is a market to be nurtured and grown over time.
Niche Markets – with the marked reduction in the size of the Fraser sockeye fishery in recent years, participants have had only scant production.
This has afforded the opportunity to open-up new local distribution channels.
Some harvesters have had success "direct marketing" their harvest to the public (via public sales floats, the internet, or simply doorto-door) or to restaurants.
First Nations have enjoyed small successes with sale of traditional products.
The success of these activities has emboldened many harvesters, though the scale of this commerce has been very small.
Typically, niche markets are quickly filled as fish volume grows (even a wellmarketed scheme like Copper River).
However, a new sector of small-scale entrepreneurs is now a component of the Fraser River sockeye salmon marketing framework.
This is essentially the market picture now facing Fraser River sockeye salmon fishery participants: the challenges of competing in large-scale commodity canned and frozen markets, opportunities to service a growing North American fresh/frozen market, and the realities of translating micromarketing success into larger scale enterprise.
For Fraser sockeye stakeholders to improve the revenue side of the profitability equation, they must understand the everchanging market picture, and embrace a market-driven business philosophy: offering customers what they want.
Seafood Value Chain Roundtable
Fraser River Sockeye Salmon Benchmark Study
Pink and chum salmon, always abundant from Alaskan, Japanese, or Russian fisheries if not from BC, offer wild salmon alternatives at budget prices.
To be marketed as a premium wild salmon and command premium prices, however, sockeye salmon must meet lofty customer expectations.
Other "premium" attributes associated with top-quality sockeye salmon are firm flesh texture, bright skin colour, and high oil/fat content.
Consumers purchasing lesser quality sockeye (at premium prices) will be disappointed, reducing the chances of re-purchase, motivating them to purchase a lower-priced salmon, or causing them to abandon the salmon category altogether.
A Wild Alternative As mentioned, seafood consumers have been "spoiled" by farmed salmon in terms of the consistency of the product: always available, always fresh, always the same size, colour, and flavour.
By providing customers with consistent value, farmed salmon first displaced wild salmon on many seafood shelves around the world, and then expanded the market category substantially.
In the last couple of years, however, there has been a consumer backlash against farmed salmon: not because of customer dissatisfaction with the product itself, but because of highly publicized environmental impacts related to the rearing of the animals and concerns about additives in the feed.
While some consumers remain loyal to farmed salmon, others have turnedoff it completely, and others are increasingly amenable to wild salmon alternatives.
This backlash has provided a real opportunity for wild salmon to regain profile in an expanded market category.
The emerging consumer preference for wild salmon, however, is not a carte blanche for producers to sell poor quality and/or over-priced product to the marketplace.
For wild salmon to gain an enduring position alongside (or as a replacement to) farmed salmon, producers must provide consumers with consistent strong value.
Fraser River Sockeye Salmon Benchmark Study round fresh product, once (or even twice) frozen product can be entirely satisfactory, providing the fish is well handled from capture through presentation to the consumer.
For sockeye salmon to maintain and grow its market position, customers must be consistently provided with a premium quality, red-fleshed salmon.
About Fraser Sockeye Quality It seems logical that to command a premium price in a marketplace loaded with salmon alternatives, sockeye salmon must meet strict quality standards and possess strong product attributes.
But how is the Fraser River fishery positioned to meet customer expectations?
The intrinsic quality of Fraser sockeye is superb – more than adequate to meet market standards.
Knowledgeable seafood buyers around the world prize Fraser sockeye’s red flesh, high oil and fat content, and bright hue.
The large in-river distance traversed by most Fraser sockeye stocks in order to reach their spawning grounds implies a firm, fat, robust fish as it completes the ocean portion of its migration and braces for the fresh-water passage.
Physiological Changes During Migration During the Fraser sockeye’s journey up-river, however, the attributes of the fish change.
No longer feeding, and battling against the rivers’ flows, sockeye are fuelled by built-up stores of energy (fat, oil, muscle).
Skin thickens, and colour changes from bright blue-silver, to duller shades of red-grey.
Fish lose body weight, and re-productive organs comprise a growing portion of the sockeye’s mass.
Some of the red pigment in the flesh is transferred to the skin and the eggs, making the flesh paler.
As muscle is spent, and energy consumed, flesh becomes softer, and belly-walls thinner.
Sockeye arrive at the spawning grounds substantially spent.
The following table provides a comparison of a
Fraser River Sockeye Salmon Benchmark Study Fraser sockeye’s appearance and market/product attributes as it progresses through its migration3.

Intrinsic fish attributes pose serious constraints on use.
Not suitable for most "conventional" products and markets.
Some specimens may not be marketable.

Reduced market attractiveness implies a lower commercial value.
The following points are excerpted from this illuminating presentation:
If management creates additional political risk, it can make longterm investments impossible to justify."
These observations, drawn from the Alaskan salmon fishery, are highly transferable to the Fraser River sockeye fishery.
About Fraser Sockeye Fishery Management The over-riding objective of Fraser River sockeye fishery management is conservation of the stocks, with the second objective to provide adequate sockeye access to First Nations throughout the watershed for Food, Social, and Ceremonial purposes.
Another top priority is abiding by the terms of the Salmon Treaty with the USA.
Tertiary objectives are provision of recreational and commercial fishing opportunities.
Under the current environment facing fishery managers, the certainty of achieving priority objectives is undermined by mounting commercial fisheries, particularly large-scale ones occurring in the ocean.
Commercial fishery management on the Fraser can be characterized as seeking to find low-risk (or risk-less) windows of opportunity for the commercial fleet to "crop" some quantity of sockeye, at some location.
Fishery managers likely recognize that their management decisions impact industry’s revenues and costs, though they may understate the extent of these impacts.
Rather than being in a position to mitigate these impacts, however, fishery managers are simply unable to address them.
Business considerations are not among the variables receiving weight when decisions regarding commercial fisheries are rendered.
To address revenues, industry must be market-driven - give the customer what he wants.
Customers want quality, consistency, predictability – a sockeye salmon justifying its premium position in the marketplace.
Fraser River catches are highly sporadic and the catch mix is weighted to in-river caught sockeye… fish lacking the attributes the global market demands.
Fishery management has a strong influence on revenues and expenses in fisheries; appropriate fisheries management can go a long way to addressing business issues.
Fraser River commercial fishery management is, in practice, indifferent to business issues, to the obvious detriment of the business.
The forgoing paints a bleak picture of key business conditions facing the Fraser River sockeye salmon industry and indeed the business is in dire straits.
The purpose of the analysis provided thus far in the paper is to lay out in detail the root causes of the malaise in the Fraser River sockeye business.
Evaluation Framework In this section the elements of a financial model are presented.
The model allows varying market, production, and fishery scenarios to be evaluated.
The model is based on a combination of hard numbers and reasoned estimates.
The assumptions and methodology underlying the model have been vetted by industry leaders, and results are deemed to be very reflective of reality.
It is hoped that this analysis can remove some of the "secrecy" surrounding the business side of the Fraser River sockeye salmon fishery.
Seafood Value Chain Roundtable
A reformed, or market driven, fishery is assumed to be non-competitive, and conducted at a slow pace throughout the migration.
The fishery-type impacts the consistency and pattern of landings, and has a strong influence on quality (handling practices) and marketability.
Market price levels for Fraser River sockeye products – markets fluctuate up and down, and wholesale price levels have a major impact on financial performance for participants.
To a large extent, wholesale prices are set by external forces (supply conditions, competitor’s pricing, exchange rates, etc.). By improving quality and consistency of supply, however, Fraser sockeye participants may exert some (upward) influence over market prices.
A range of market prices for each product in the mix (high, medium, low) is provided in this analysis.
Catch level – the total commercial harvest of Fraser sockeye, in pieces and pounds.
Financial Data A host of detailed financial assumptions are utilized in the model, including data on finished product yields (which vary with intrinsic fish quality), unit (per pound) selling prices, and unit production costs (including unloading, trucking, processing, packaging, and warehousing).
In practice, these specific values vary by company – some operations are more efficient, others less.
• The wholesale revenue of the Fraser River sockeye salmon fishery - the size of the revenue pie is a critical determinant of returns to participants.
Addressing the revenue side of the profitability equation is a key theme of this paper.
Fish prices paid to harvesters - harvesters receive the residual value of the fish.
Results are provided for each product line in the Fraser River sockeye product mix, so that differing returns can be readily seen.
Round Pounds vs. Finished Pounds Readers of seafood industry financial reports must be aware of the difference between figures reported in round pounds (whole fish as they come out of the water), and those reported in finished pounds (product in processed form as it is sold to the wholesale market).
As sockeye is processed into its various product forms, removal of head, guts, frames, skin, and any dehydration processes (smoking, drying), result in loss of weight.
Selling prices and processing costs are typically reported in finished pounds.
Harvesters generally think in round pound terms – the basis by which they are most often paid.
Thus, marketers and fishermen may not be speaking the same financial language when they discuss sockeye prices and costs.
For the purposes of this study, a mix of six products is identified, representing the product mix for Fraser River sockeye.
The six products, listed from highest-value/best returns to lowest, are: 1.
Smoked (cold smoked, sliced) 2.
Value add portion (a variety of products) 3.
½ pound canned 6.
Value Spectrum
Canned Salmon – ¼ lb
High end of commodity canned salmon market Commodity item; used for re-processing into a variety of products.
Various sizes and quality grades.
Commodity item; BC producers generally avoid production of ½ lb from Fraser sockeye Low-end commodity item; shrinking market; retailers not keen to carry
½ lb canned salmon; requires reasonable quality salmon ½ lb canned salmon; uses "marginal" quality salmon (terminal)
The intrinsic quality of the fish, together with the way they are handled and the pattern by
A terminal fishery under the current fishery approach yields a product mix heavily weighted to lowvalue, low-return products, and offers un-proven marketability.
The above assumptions simulate reality in that:
About "Terminal" Fraser Sockeye Assessing the marketability and value of terminal-caught Fraser sockeye is a challenging, and highly subjective, exercise.
In this paper, "terminal" is broadly defined as sockeye that have passed through the estuary (Area 29) and are in the freshwater approaches to the spawning grounds.
This interpretation implies:
• A wide range of fish attributes, from somewhat bright/fat/red-fleshed, to red-skinned/oil-depleted/skinny.
Fraser River Sockeye Salmon Benchmark Study The percentage of fish meeting the latter description rises as proximity to the spawning grounds increases.
• A range of marketability – as sexual maturity advances with proximity to spawning grounds, the options for marketability diminish.
Perspectives on terminal sockeye quality and marketability, not surprisingly, vary by stakeholder.
The following table summarizes impressions gained during the assembly of this paper.
Perspectives on Terminal Sockeye Industry Fish quality is poor: diminished oil, fat, flesh colour, general appearance, odour.
A marked reduction in quality is noted in specimens harvested above the Fraser Canyon.
A portion will make ½ lb standard grade.
Fish harvested above the Fraser Canyon are seldom marketable at all.
The market size for standard grade canned sockeye is extremely finite.
Local sales (round, dressed), Traditional Products (eg. dried, hot-smoked) Fish is quite satisfactory for Inland First Nations and their neighbours, confirming it’s potential marketability.
Pilot product & First Nations branding initiatives show promise.
Fish Quality
Product Forms/ Distribution Channels
Growth Potential (marketability under increased harvest levels)
Business development is required to realize full market potential.
Amidst the differing perspectives, there is also common ground:
However, industry is watching with interest First Nations product/market initiatives utilizing terminal sockeye.
•
Weighing the perspectives on terminal sockeye, the following premises underlie the financial analysis presented in this paper:
Seafood Value Chain Roundtable
Fraser River Sockeye Salmon Benchmark Study
• Terminal sockeye fits into the low end of the sockeye value spectrum; with fewer market options and lessened quality attributes, it is intuitive that terminal sockeye is of lower value than ocean or estuary specimens.
Given the current small-scale of terminal sockeye marketing efforts and the challenges presented by the fish, it seems logical that it will take considerable time to develop "industrial-scale" outlets for terminal sockeye.
In this section financial schedules are presented to simulate the financial performance of the Fraser River sockeye fishery.
Following are two schedules:
• Incremental (per pound) Analysis – showing returns by product line, and weighted average returns to processors and harvesters, given the product mix.
Fishery-wide Analysis – showing total dollar revenues, expenses, and returns to processors and harvesters.
Incremental Analysis Fishery Location & Type:
Estuary-caught fish, competitive fishery Mid Smoked Value Add Side Portion 5% 39% $ 13.50 $ 5% 55% 6.50 $ 1/4 lb Canned 25% 70% 5.21 $ Headed & Gutted Frozen 30% 76% 3.30 1/2 lb Canned 35% 71% $ 3.65 1/2 lb Canned Standard 0% 69% $ 2.81 Weighted Average
Fishery-Wide Analysis Harvest Level Fishery Location & Type:
Market Price Level:
Fraser River Sockeye Salmon Benchmark Study This scenario is intended to resemble the financial picture in the Fraser River sockeye fishery for the 2005 season.
It assumes:
• Fish are harvested in the "estuary."
In fact, today’s harvest features a blend of ocean, estuary, and terminal fish.
It is recognized the Area E fisheries in Area 29 have been extremely limited in recent years, but for study purposes, the harvest blend is deemed to "average-out" to that associated with estuary harvest.
A competitive fishery – short openings, few openings, unpredictable openings.
Insights arising out of the financial schedules are as follows:
Incremental Analysis:
The figure shows returns per pound of production allocated to each product line.
For instance, a pound of sockeye allocated to the "smoked side" product form would return $1.62 per finished pound to the processor, and $2.90 per round pound to the harvester.
At the other end of the spectrum, a pound of sockeye allocated to "1/2 lb standard canned" would return $0.34 to the processor and $0.60 to the harvester.
The weighted average returns arising from the product mix shown are $0.38 per round pound to processors (margin) and $1.60 per round pound to harvesters.
From a business perspective, there is ample room for improving the make-up of the product mix to improve per-pound returns to stakeholders.
as this report is finalized in July of 2006, market prices for sockeye have softened appreciably from levels seen in 2005.
The following table summarizes returns to participants under a range of capture locations (ocean, estuary, or terminal) and fishery-types (reformed or competitive), assuming the entire harvest is directed to one fishery-type.
Fishery type:
For the same scale of fishery (875,000 fish caught) and the same market conditions (mid-level), results differ dramatically.
The reason for the variation is the impact that capture location and fishery-type have on the product mix.
A higher valued product mix yields superior returns for participants.
This calculation assumes that, for this catch level, all terminal production would be marketable – an assumption that is untested.
Available for Harvesters (per round lb):
When values per pound of sockeye salmon rise, harvesters benefit the most; when they
This is because production costs in the industry are substantial, and are linked to production levels, not sales values.
Harvesters receive the residual value of the fish – the balance remaining after production costs and processor margins are deducted.
The wide range of values shown in the preceding table disproves the notion held by some harvesters that market conditions and fish attributes are not their concern.
Growing the Harvest Higher catches provide an obvious means of improving revenues in the Fraser River sockeye salmon fishery.
The benefits of increased catches are most pronounced when the product mix is also addressed.
In order to acknowledge the promise of terminal sockeye initiatives, while recognizing their current limitations, it is assumed that, as harvest volumes grow, the marketable percentage of the catch declines.
A schedule of "best-guess" terminal-sockeye marketability assumptions is appended to this report.
Med Sales Revenue (wholesale 51,802,098 value of catch) Production Costs 18,031,024 Processors Margin 6,216,252 Available for Harvesters 27,554,822 Available for Harvesters (per $ 1.60 round lb) *assumes terminal harvest is 40% marketable Catch Level (pieces)
Available for Harvesters 36,739,763 Available for Harvesters (per $ 1.60 round lb) *assumes terminal harvest is 33% marketable
Fraser River Sockeye Salmon Benchmark Study high-value and low-value product mixes grows wider.
By combining an improved product mix with larger harvest volumes, the value of the Fraser River sockeye salmon harvest grows exponentially, as do returns to participants.
The wisdom – and financial appeal – of strategies to maximize the economic benefit of available resources are readily apparent.
"Highest value" returns are not theoretical, but can be achieved through cooperation and sound execution.
Given this, vastly lesser returns should not be tolerated by stakeholders.
Financial Results – Summary This section offers some rather detailed quantitative analysis.
The analysis utilizes reasonable and realistic assumptions to provide calculations of the benefits accruing to participants in the commercial Fraser River sockeye salmon fishery under a range of scenarios.
It is intended that this analysis:
• Provides some financial information (regarding revenues and costs in the industry) that may be new and informative to some participants.
Provokes thought on strategies for improving the business performance of the Fraser River sockeye salmon fishery.
Provides a framework for analyzing various options for rebuilding the Fraser River sockeye business.
The conditions contributing to the strength of the Fraser River sockeye business no longer exist, and will not return:
Fraser River Sockeye Salmon Benchmark Study
• Industrial-scale harvests (average catch 7 million fish for the 1990-1997 period) occurred under a mixed-stock fishery.
With allocation priorities, a precautionary management approach, and Species at Risk Act realities entrenched in policy and legislation, industrial-scale mixed stock fisheries are a thing of the past.
Fraser sockeye marketers have lost their "clout."
Japan is no longer a default high-value outlet for frozen headed and gutted sockeye; both market size and prices have shrunk.
BC producers have been displaced from the ½ pound canned market by low-cost competition from Alaska.
Our expedient, high-value options for selling the pack have largely evaporated. prevailing in the past have
The rules of engagement fundamentally changed.
Don’t Accept the Present… Recent developments in the Fraser sockeye fishery have effectively grounded the business.
An industrial activity is now little more than a cottage one (2005 harvest level 128,000 fish, with a value of 1/100 of that earned in 1994).
Business considerations have been subjugated to higher priority objectives.
Among the strengths to build upon:
• Strong escapements seen in recent years provide the potential for healthy runs in the future.
The Fraser River is still one of the world’s largest sockeye producing systems.
There is no doubt that a system of this size and productivity can support meaningful commercial activity.
Growth in the North American market for fresh/frozen portions, and a diverse Fraser sockeye product mix offer marketing upside.
Industry infrastructure, though depleted, comprises a strong base for re-building.
Renewed investment in the industry will follow improved business prospects.
Given the latent resource and business opportunities facing the Fraser sockeye industry, continued floundering is simply not acceptable.
• Strong harvest volumes are an ingredient, but not a guarantee of, business success.
Shifting markets and growing competition necessitated major business adjustments.
Marketing (branding, quality programs) can be effective in differentiating regional product, gaining price premiums, and influencing consumer perceptions.
However, high-value niches are quickly filled.
Designing a fishery to address business shortcomings (landings pattern, quality, marketability) leads directly to improved revenues and decreased costs.
However, industry restructuring will accompany fishery reform.
Align Interests It has been shown in this study the capture location (ocean, estuary, or terminal) strongly influences marketability.
In reality, determining the location of capture is not a simple business decision, but a complex political issue.
A primary impediment to implementing business reform in the Fraser River sockeye salmon fishery is the division between key interests:
• Industry wishes to restore harvest levels in the ocean where, it argues, the fish are most valuable.
First Nations wish to establish enhanced commercial access to sockeye.
Many First Nations are located in the Fraser watershed, implying a terminal harvest.
These First Nations argue that they have developed lucrative markets for traditional products utilizing terminal fish.
Government is balancing multiple objectives: ensuring that multiple conservation objectives are met, meeting fiduciary responsibilities to First Nations for food, social and ceremonial fish, and providing for economic opportunities for both First Nations and industry.
Government is thus in a difficult position.
Growing the "ocean" fishery could be viewed as compromising conservation and First Nations access to the resource.
Growing the terminal harvest could be viewed as un-compensated re-allocation of the resource away from the commercial sector.
Neither industry nor First Nations are satisfied with the scale or profitability of the business.
To establish a productive working relationship, both parties’ fears must be addressed:
Industry and First Nations share a common desire to grow sustainable businesses.
Industry is interested in working with First Nations to access sockeye and add value to the harvest.
First Nations are interested in utilizing industry’s expertise and infrastructure to expand their product mix and market exposure.
Both industry and First Nations recognize the folly of pursuing separate paths.
There is considerable will to work together.
Developing specific strategies to build bridges between commercial industry and inland First Nations interests is well beyond the scope of this study, but it is important to note that a successful partnership between the parties will pave the way for implementation of required business initiatives.
A Vision of the Fraser Sockeye Business Rather than providing a prescription for re-building the Fraser River sockeye business (stakeholders will determine implementation details), a vision describing the Fraser sockeye business of the future is now provided.
This vision draws upon the substantial input of industry stakeholders gained during the development of this report.
Scope of the Fishery The Fraser sockeye system is a sizeable one that can support substantial harvests.
It is a far larger system than either Copper River or Chignik (annual catches of about 1.5 million sockeye).
Assuming run-sizes similar to those seen in recent cycles, annual Fraser sockeye harvests in the 2-4 million fish range should be achievable.
From current catch levels (averaging less than one million fish), harvests will be grown systematically, as new fishery techniques are tested, and as markets are developed.
The scope of the future fishery will be less than the industrial fishery of the past, but far greater than the cottage-scale fishery of today.
Harvest location – specifically, maximizing the amount of product caught in the ocean – will be an explicit factor in fishery management.
Making the most of fish harvested terminally will be a business key.
Fishery Type The fishery will be market driven, allowing stakeholders to best meet customer requirements.
Elements of a market-driven fishery:
• Improved precision in forecasting runs and harvests to facilitate business planning and instil confidence in customers and stakeholders.
Harvests throughout the migration, allowing for sustained fresh market penetration; small-scale "bites" on the shoulders of the season, larger harvests during the peaks.
A non-competitive fishery focused on quality, value and costefficiency.
Pilot fisheries conducted by the commercial fleet to-date (Barkley Sound, San Juan, Johnstone Strait, Area F troll) provide a sampling of benefits.
The Chignik Cooperative provides a larger-scale illustration.
A selective, sustainable fishery that satisfies the concerns of both conservation-minded fishery managers and conscientious consumers.
Product and Market Development With greater emphasis on harvest location, handling practices, and fishing patterns, industry will be able to allocate more sockeye to higher value products, resulting in a more valuable product mix.
Niche product and market innovations initiated by small-scale entrepreneurs and First Nations will be encouraged and developed over time.
High quality commodity products will continue to comprise the majority of production and value, with USA fresh markets providing attractive growth opportunities.
Fraser River Sockeye Salmon Benchmark Study Fraser sockeye industry will be diversified and competitive in the breadth of its product mix.
Marketing Support A substantial generic marketing program supports Fraser River stakeholders’ product and market development initiatives (just as ASMI supports the Alaskan salmon industry).
The profile of Fraser sockeye amongst wholesalers will be restored, and consumers will become aware of this top-quality sockeye.
Consolidated Commercial Fishery Stakeholders have recognized that mounting a multitude of fisheries for a multitude of users works counter to the objective of growing harvest levels.
With allocation issues settled, and harvesters provided with secure access to a share of the resource, the focus has shifted to maximizing the value of the harvest.
Industry and First Nations businesses are harmonized, with harvest, product, and market decisions made on business, not territorial, grounds.
A Competitive Business The competitive environment facing Fraser River sockeye producers grows ever more challenging.
There are more distractions, added costs, and competition than ever.
Alaskan fisheries, the pace setters in the sockeye business, have continued to refine and improve their business practices.
Closing Observation In a "standard" business case (for example, a struggling corporation), a management team is charged with the task of devising a turnaround strategy.
The contractor does not under-estimate the hurdles to getting Fraser River sockeye salmon fishery stakeholders on the same page and working together.

Market Information Canada THE CANADIAN GINSENG INDUSTRY:
PREPARING FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
Introduction Canada is a natural habitat for North American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) or "xi yang shen"; one of three true ginseng plants from the Araliaceae family.
It is indigenous to the eastern areas of North America proliferating in the Ontario, Quebec, and Wisconsin.
The Native Indians had used wild North American ginseng for its healing properties long before French colonization (Pritts, 1995).
But in 1716, a Jesuit priest, Father Joseph-Francois Lafitau, documented the existence of North American ginseng in Canada.
Exports of wild North American ginseng to China began in 1721 and their export value was second only to fur (Evans, 1994).
After the introduction of North American ginseng to China, Chinese manuscripts and traditional medical writing documented the benefits of North American ginseng consumption.
The Chinese have since prized this herb for its healing and health promoting properties (Duke, 1989).
With time, the wild ginseng population became severely depleted from over-harvesting and commercial cultivation of North American ginseng in Canada began in the late 1890's (Fisher, 1994).
But it was not until the early 1980's that ginseng production witnessed exponential growth due to the lure of lucrative profits.
By 1998, the industry would see production reach more than 1800 metric tonnes (MT) compared to less than 25 MT in 1982.
There are now more than 2000 hectares in production; about one third in British Columbia and about two thirds in Ontario.
Export value has increased from just under $Cdn 3 million in 1982 to more than $Cdn 61 million in 1998 (Statistics Canada, 1999).
Ginseng Usage and Properties Culturally, many Asian people believe the yin and yang theory based on Daoist philosophy.
Yin is the mild, cool force, while yang is the strong, hot force.
The equilibrium of these two forces maintains the peace and health of the universe and the same is thought to apply to the human body.
It is believed that when yin and yang become unbalanced, the body becomes more prone to sickness and disease.
North American ginseng represents yin and is heralded as an elixir for the immune system and general well being (Proctor and Bailey, 1987; Small, 1997).
Each is described as having unique effects.
While Asian ginseng is said to have a heating effect that invigorates, stimulates and heals the body, especially when the body is depleted, North American ginseng is said to have a cooling effect that relieves stress, calms the body, and strengthens the internal organs.
Claims about North American ginseng benefits come not only from a traditional Oriental viewpoint, but also scientific research has documented the active ingredients (Lui, 1980; Duke, 1989; Ma et al., 1996).
A regular dosage of North American ginseng is believed to reduce stress and fatigue, improve short-term memory, reduce blood pressure, regulate cholesterol and blood sugar level, reduce symptoms of menopause, reinforce the immune system and increase longevity (Pritts, 1995; Small, 1997).
Key Players in North American Ginseng Production Canada is the world's largest grower of North American ginseng, accounting for more than 60% of world production (Figure 1).
However, Canada is a minor user of all ginseng species, with imports of about $Cdn 5 million.
Ginseng production in Canada has increased 18 fold in 12 years, from 106 MT in 1987 to 1864 MT in 1998.
In the next few years, production will settle and likely decline, allowing North American ginseng prices to stabilize and reflect the economic cost of production.
Exporting approximately 800 MT in 1998, the US is the world's second largest producer of North American ginseng and fourth in terms of all ginseng produced.
China accounts for less than 7% of total North American ginseng production but is the largest consumer of North American ginseng.
In 1998, industry estimates of Chinese-produced North American ginseng varied from 150 MT to 300 MT, as China continues to strive for self-sufficiency and avoid the use of precious foreign reserves.
China also issued standards on North American ginseng products in December 1998, to further augment the prestige and quality control of domestically grown North American ginseng.
However, the Chinese prefer genuine native North American ginseng and often pay a premium for imported North American ginseng (The Guangzhou Drug Company, a major ginseng importer; The Division of Traditional Medicine in Beijing; personal communication).
In the past few of years, there has been a trend in both Canada and the US to decrease North American ginseng production due to lower ginseng prices.
The average price of cultivated ginseng dropped from $112 Cdn per kg in 1992 to $40 Cdn per kg in 1998, while the average price of wild simulated root dropped from $243 USD per kg to $127 USD per kg during the same period.
Currently, Canadian ginseng companies need higher yields and better quality ginseng roots to minimize costs, to stabilize prices, and to remain competitive.
The total production of Canada and the US may stabilize between 2000 to 2500 MT in the next few years, approaching production levels where prices are economical (Figure 2).
North American ginseng prices and Canadian export volume*, 1991-1998.
Another segment of the North American ginseng industry is the wild simulated North American ginseng or woods-grown ginseng.
This product commands on average 10 times the price of field cultivated root at the retail consumer level.
North American wild simulated ginseng root exports, primarily US production, peaked at 191 MT in 1996, but have since dropped to 108 MT in 1998 (US$13.8 M).
Canada's Key Trading Partners Hong Kong - The Ginseng Gateway Hong Kong continues to be Canada's premier trading partner for exports of North American ginseng.
Exports to Hong Kong represented 84% of all North American ginseng exported from Canada in 1998.
China and USA were a distant second and third at 10% and 2% respectively.
Canadian export volume of North American ginseng to Hong Kong increased by 29% from 919 MT in 1997 to 1299 MT in 1998 (Table 1).
Ginseng export value accounted for 14% of all Canadian agriculture and agri-food products exported to Hong Kong in 1998.
Hong Kong has a long tradition of being a global ginseng trade depot.
China - The Main Consumer Market Although Hong Kong is the first destination market for North American ginseng, more than 80% of the North American roots entering Hong Kong is re-exported to China.
The Chinese consumers are the ultimate end users of North American ginseng, and statistics show China consumes (imports) more than 75% of all North American ginseng production (Statistics Canada, Hong Kong Trade Statistics, US Department of Agriculture).
Canadian Domestic Exports of Ginseng Root*, 1991-1998.
North American ginseng is sold in bulk to major Hong Kong buyers and then shipped to China for further grading and secondary processing.
Authenticity and quality are key concerns among the Chinese North American ginseng consumers (Mr.
Xu Jin Bai - Deputy Chief Pharmacist of the Shanghai Trade Association of Traditional Medicine Drugs, personal communication), and are factors that support continued desire for imported North American ginseng.
Other Markets Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia and other ASEAN countries are all small but growing markets for North American ginseng.
These countries, along with Japan, all recognize the value of ginseng.
But due to traditional practices and/or pharmacopoeia, Asian ginseng has dominated their market share.
As well, Latin American and European markets hold a higher regard for Asian ginseng.
Asian ginseng is almost solely recognized as the ginseng of choice, to the detriment of North American ginseng.
There is a need to educate these markets regarding the complementary nature of North American ginseng and Asian ginseng.
Currently, all of the above countries are small market niches, but they present significant future potential for the North American ginseng industry should industry associations or major companies invest in marketing, supported with sound scientific research.
Collaboration between Industry and Government Ginseng growers in British Columbia and Ontario are members of The Associated Ginseng Growers of British Columbia (TAGG) and/or the Ginseng Growers Association of Canada (GGAC), together representing more than 90% of Canadian ginseng production.
Assisted by the Canadian Government, they have formed the Canadian Ginseng Team whose mandate is to develop and implement national ginseng marketing strategies (Charest, 1998).
The team's mission is to increase the export of Canadian-grown North American ginseng root and value-added products.
The goals include:
• increasing the market share of North American ginseng in traditional markets, while developing new markets;
• developing the value-added sector and its markets worldwide; and
• increasing adaptability to provide industry stability and sustainability.
The team has identified some key elements required to achieve these goals.
The ginseng industry wants a reliable information base to make informed production and marketing decisions, as well as favorable market access conditions worldwide, especially China, for North American ginseng.
The industry is working toward stronger national and even trans-national cooperation and coordination to implement a marketing strategy for North American ginseng.
It wants quality standards, effective communication tools, quality control programs, sound efficacy research, market information, and a way to educate consumers on the value of North American ginseng.
The team must continue to work collectively on planned market development initiatives to address the structural challenges facing the industry.
Canada's department of agriculture, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, has and will continue to support industry led initiatives, supported by both TAGG and GGAC, that will benefit the ginseng industry in Canada.
Conclusions In the past two decades, Canada has grown to be the world's largest producer of North American ginseng and is seeking corresponding levels of market development.
Farming and post-harvest practices of large Canadian producers are efficient and improving.
Canadian companies have reported yield increases from 10-30% over the past four years, while costs per hectare have decreased as much as 50% for some companies.
The producers that are most competitive in yield, quality and price will be the core producers in the future.
However, companies that successfully market North American ginseng will be the ones reaping the most reward in terms of profit.
Marketing in the 21st century will depend on many important factors including quality standards and control, and market and efficacy research.
Since communications, access to information, knowledge bases, and trade will increase at an accelerating pace, consumers in the 21st century will be more value driven, informed, and demanding.
Companies that market successfully to those requirements will be the beneficiaries.
The Canadian ginseng industry has overcome many challenges to become the largest producer of North American Ginseng in the world.

Prospects for Quebec’s Food and Beverage Industry - Dairy Industry
1.0 QUEBEC FOOD AND BEVERAGE INDUSTRY Largest Manufacturing Industry in Quebec Agri-food activities, from harvesting resources to delivering foods and beverages to consumers, constitute one of the cornerstones of the Quebec economy, accounting for close to 12% of all jobs, or over 400,000, and injecting close to $12.4 billion each year into the Quebec economy, or 8% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
Shipments Value of Quebec Manufcaturing Industry , by sector, 1999 Chemicals 7% Others 34% 1
A Booming, Diversified Industry The Quebec food and beverage industry is highly diversified.
The dairy industry is the largest sector, accounting for 28% of all food and beverage manufacturing shipments in Quebec for 1999.
The red meat industry, chiefly pork, ranks second, with 21% of shipments, followed by animal feeds, with 9%.

Food and beverage processing alone generates $5 billion each year in added value and 55,700 direct jobs in the economy.
The Quebec industry accounts for 25% of food and 3 beverage jobs in Canada and 25% of value added.
Between 1998 and 1999, total growth amounted to more than $570 million.
If other receipts such as sales of goods purchased and resold as is are counted, the value of shipments and other food and beverage revenue in Quebec adds up to $15.1 billion.

The food and beverage industry has certainly 5 benefited from the growth in the Canadian market . Overall demand increased by 18% between 1994 and 1999, for a mean annual growth of 3.7%.
Sectors in which growth in demand was particularly strong over the period are wines (11.2%), confectionery and chocolate (6.9%), flour milling (6.6%), vegetable oils (6%) and poultry products (6%).
Between 1994 and 1999, the Canadian beverage market saw higher mean annual growth than the food market (4.9% as opposed to 3.5%).
Change in Canadian Food and Beverage Market ($M) 60 000

DAIRY INDUSTRY MANUFACTURING OUTPUT Thousands of tons 250
Changes in the Canadian Dairy Processing Market 30
Speciality cheese
With $3.2 billion in manufacturing shipments in 1999, 70% consisting of processed products, the dairy product sector is the largest agri-food processing sector in Quebec.
Low-fat milk 150
In this scenario, the price of milk paid by processors should rise less slowly over the period, because animal feed costs will decline and the rise in prices will be below the historical mean.
The Quebec industry has enviable expertise, coupled with modern techniques and processes.
This expertise in product development and innovation is a definite asset for the future development of the industry.
A Stagnating Domestic Market Consumer trends in the industry indicate a mature market in which the growth of demand in certain categories (yogurt, speciality cheeses, low-fat milk) is offset by a drop in other categories (fluid milk, butter, ice cream).
AAFC. Medium Term Policy Baseline, January 2000.
Liberty is even more daring, with its line of Méditerranée yogurt containing 8% fat.
Similarly, Unilever is promoting its Breyers ice creams, which combine ice cream and chocolate bars.
Quite a treat!
The chief exports are cheeses (36%), powdered milk (24%) and evaporated/condensed milk (10%).
The main countries or regions importing them are the U.S., with 41%, by value, followed by the European Union with 14% and Central America and the West Indies with 13%.
Quebec accounts for 60% of Canadian exports.
Changes that must be made to the Canadian system of supplying plants for the export of dairy products affected Canadian exports in 1999 and 2000 (a 28% drop in the first six months of 2000).
Dairy producers and processors had set up the Optional Export Program (OEP) to promote the continuous supply of milk to processors for products intended for export.
In the fall of 1999, in response to a complaint filed by the United States and New Zealand, the appeal body of the World Trade Organization (WTO), ruled that the Canadian dairy industry’s export milk pricing system constitutes an export subsidy and does not comply with Canada’s commitments under the WTO Agreement on Agriculture.
The direct impact of this ruling has been a major reduction in the amount of milk available to processors for export, as the authorized limits negotiated during the Uruguay Round were reached in February 2000 (milk year starting August 1).
The absence of such a growth policy will limit companies to operating in the Canadian market, at a time when they face increased competition at home and abroad.
2.3 STRUCTURE/INVESTMENTS
This shows the major consolidation going on in the fluid milk market in Quebec, as in the rest of Canada.
In the case of processing companies, the new establishments are the result of investments in the manufacturing of fine cheeses.
The industry is dominated by big businesses, whether co-operatives like Agropur and the Lactel Group or private companies like the Saputo Group, Danone and Parmalat.
Intense competition both on the Canadian market and abroad is forcing companies to adopt various approaches to increase their competitiveness.
In 1993, for instance, Agropur entered into a strategic alliance with Dairyworld to create Ultima Foods, which is responsible for all operations related to the production of yogurt and fresh desserts for both co-ops.
Despite the quality of their products and infrastructures, many Quebec companies have poor financial performance that limits their capacity to invest, whether it be to increase market share or to conduct research and development.
Existing companies have the capacity to meet the needs of the Canadian domestic market effectively and so there is little room for new foreign investors.
Co-ops Does not include shipments under OEP Source:
Its preferred targets were firms concentrating on speciality cheeses, mainly mozzarella.
In a mature domestic market, the greatest challenge faced by the Quebec dairy processor is to increase revenue and earn satisfactory profit margins.
Growth through merger and acquisition is one of the best ways to establish big companies that operate internationally and are able to compete successfully on a variety of markets.
In the dairy industry, whether in Quebec or elsewhere in Canada, growth through acquisition has traditionally been the means chosen to increase market share and profit from the associated supplies.
This method of growth is becoming increasingly difficult, given the limited number of companies that can be acquired.
The latest deal (February 2000), the purchase of the Cayer-JCB Group by Saputo Inc., is a good example.
Saputo’s expertise in acquisitions means that new companies are assimilated smoothly.
Nonproductive costs are soon eliminated and efforts are focussed on making the most of productive assets and seeking operational efficiency at low 7
Moreover, continued investment by producers in the purchase of ever more expensive quotas raises questions about the long-term impact of financing and the transferability of the enterprises.
And finally, the industry will have to implement a new formula that is in line with Canada’s commitments and that will enable it to develop a long-term vision and strategy in order to take full advantage of export markets.
A number of other major constraints will help shape the future of the industry.
The maturity of demand on the domestic market will force companies to develop new products more actively.
It is interesting to note Page 6
Stella Foods (U.S.) in 1997, Avonmore Cheese and Waterford Food Products (U.S.), as well as Riverside Cheese and Butter Inc. and Bari Cheese Ltd.
Changes in consumer habits will also give rise to new constraints.
More frequent dining out and changes in the types of products consumed will also require companies to renew the range of products they offer, especially to provide better service to the hotels, restaurants and institutions (HRI) market.
Relentless competition from soft drink, beverage and juice makers will continue to influence the buying habits of younger target groups of consumers to the detriment of dairy products.
New competing products that are attractive to the industry in more than one respect are soy-based products, especially soy beverages.
They have many characteristics in common with dairy products and are often found in refrigerated counters next to milk and other dairy beverages.
Several dairy processors have already incorporated them into their range of products, including Parmalat and Dairyworld in Canada, and the U.S. industry leaders Dean Foods and Suiza Foods.
In the United States, this category had estimated sales of $300 million in 1998, up 50% over 1997.
The main challenge for the industry is to open up to the outside, which assumes that it will have access to Canadian supplies for producing exports or that it will manage to establish a presence outside Canada by entering into strategic alliances, purchasing companies or setting up operations abroad.

We would like to thank the Business Support Directorate of the Quebec Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPAQ) for their contribution to improving this document.
With shipments1 of $13.8 billion in 1999, the food and beverage industry2 was the province’s largest manufacturing sector, representing 12% of all processing in Quebec.
Food and beverage processing alone generates $5 billion each year in added value and 55,700 direct jobs in the economy.
The Quebec industry accounts for 25% of food and beverage jobs in Canada and 25% of value added.
3 Quebec’s geographic location, at the centre of a market of 100 million consumers living within 1,000 km, gives the industry here a tremen­ dous advantage.
MANUFACTURING SHIPMENTS A Booming, Diversified Industry
The Quebec food and beverage industry is highly diversified.
The red meat industry, chiefly pork, ranks second, with 21% of shipments, followed by animal feeds, with 9%.
The food and beverage industry has enjoyed strong growth over the last three years, largely due to the great strides made by the confec­ tionery/chocolate and soft drink sectors.
SUPPLY AND DEMAND 4
Between 1994 and 1999, the Canadian beverage market saw higher mean annual growth than the food market (4.9% as opposed to 3.5%).
The industry benefited most of all from a 86% growth in exports between 1994 and 1999.
Despite the unfavourable economic condi­ tions of 1997 and 1998, Quebec agri-food exports held steady at about $2.5 billion.
The weaker growth in imports (18%) enabled Quebec to improve its agri-food balance of trade appreciably over this period, achieving a slight surplus in 1998 and 1999.
4 Data on agri-food demand and trade exclude fish and seafood.
5 Based on apparent domestic market (ship­ ments + imports exports).
The United States is still the main trading partner of the Quebec food and beverage industry, accounting for 71% of sales, or $1.8 billion.
Quebec purchases are more diversified, however, thus making its supplies less dependent on the value of the U.S. dollar.
This contrasts with Canada as a whole, for which the United States accounts for almost two thirds of all agri-food trade (imports and exports).
Quebec has therefore enjoyed a greater advantage from the weakening of the euro than has the rest of Canada.
Among Quebec’s other trading partners, the European Union ranks second as a destination for our agri-food products, receiving 7.5% of trade, while Japan is the destination of 4.6% of our exports.
It is worth noting that despite the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Quebec exports only $11.5 million worth of agri-food products to Mexico, amounting to a mere 2% of Canadian exports to that country.
2.0 TEA AND COFFEE INDUSTRY The Quebec tea and coffee industry is the eighth largest manufacturing branch of the food and beverage sector, with $378 million worth of manufacturing shipments in 1999, up 31% from 19946.
The size of the industry, which employs 716 people (1997 data), is all the more remarkable given that supplies of raw materials come entirely from abroad.
The $200 million in added value in 1997 illustrates how dynamic the coffee roasting and marketing branch is in Quebec.
The variations in manufacturing shipments in the Quebec tea and coffee industry reflect fluctuations in the prices of the commodities on international markets.
Overall consumption is fairly stable, so annual variations of 5–10% in world production cause sharp price swings.
Frost, which hit the big coffee-producing areas of Brazil in 1994, led to a significant hike in prices, which in turn had an impact on the value of shipments from 1994 to 1997.
The shift in demand to speciality products with greater added value explains the upward trend in shipments.
6 These figures exclude herbal tea manufactur­ ers (standard industrial classification code:
2.1 MARKETS AND SUPPLIES Canadian coffee consumption has remained fairly stable for several years, at about 4.5 kg per capita.
Consumer demand, however, has gradually been shifting toward better-grade roasted coffee, sold as whole beans or freshly ground, and away from packaged preground or instant coffee.
In the U.S., per-capita coffee consumption fell significantly between 1975 and 1995, both of instant (-38%) and regular (-34%)7.
More recently, according to another source, sales of instant coffee declined by an average of 1.8% per year from 1996 to 1998 and should con­ tinue to slide by more than 1.5% per year until 20028.
In contrast, sales of whole coffee beans should continue to grow by 3% per year on average over the same period, given the craze for specialty coffees.
Coffee, which was traditionally drunk at home in the morning, has now become a firmly established part of daily life, work and leisure.
The rapid development of coffee houses, coffee bars and specialty shops has helped cultivate consumers’ taste for gourmet coffee.
Yet total Canadian demand has increased only slightly, as one product has been substituted for another.
In terms of value, however, the Canadian market’s growth still partially depends on fluctuations in the world price of coffee.
But by integrating their operations and adding greater value to products and services, industry players are now better able to manage their profit margins and can avoid having to pass on to consumers too quickly the sudden fluctuations in the costs of their supplies.

Broader Concerns The suspension in 1989 of the international agreement governing the coffee market, which was based on an export quota system, forced the main producing countries to regroup as the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC)9.
Its members had agreed to initiate an export program and implement the Coffee Retention Plan, the main goal of which was to curb the volatility of the price of green coffee on the market, and thus stimulate a price recovery.
Prices had dropped by more than half from their 1997 peak10.
Better quality is also being demanded on the world market.
If producers are to progress in that direction, they must receive the right signals from the market and they must be compensated satisfactorily.
Contractual agreements and producer-processor partnerships are now being developed to try to meet their mutual needs for improved quality, production techniques and profitability.
In many cases, buyers are paying well above world prices.
For the premium coffees most in demand, new sales methods now rely on auctions, either physically in the countries themselves or over the Internet.
In such cases, the effect of limited supply combined with increasing demand is forcing buyers to pay ever-higher prices.
11 Bridge News, November23, 2000.
A Hot Market Tea has been gaining in popularity since 1992, when the continuing downward trend was reversed (low point of 0.54 kg per person).
Tea consumption has been climbing since then, reaching 0.80 kg per person in 1988.
The market for premium teas and herbal teas (or tisanes) has grown remarkably12.
Specialty teas, sold in teabags in fancy packaging, and green teas are behind the growth in tea consumption in this country.
The emergence of new places to drink them, such as tea rooms and coffee houses, has also expanded both the range of products on offer and the customer base.
The industry’s chief characteristic is its high added value, because the raw material actually accounts for only about 10% of production costs.
Overall, sales of hot tea and iced tea are growing, and reached $267.5 M in 1999 in Canada 13.
Sales of teabags grew by 5%, to $152 M. Sales of black tea accounted for 76% of teabag sales and rose only 2%, while sales of fine teas leaped 21%.
Green tea enjoyed quite a fad as sales jumped 54% to reach $4 M. Sales of canned ice tea also rose, to $34 M, up 15% over 1998.
In Quebec, the three segments with the strongest growth in 1999 were black specialty teas (+41%), iced tea (+31%) and green tea (+16%).
Interestingly, the change in consumer habits is partially attributable to the health benefits associated with the drinking of tea and herbal tea.
Scientific research appears to show that green tea and black tea contain antioxidants that may help prevent heart disease and some types of cancer.
TRANSHERB e and Leika Foods are interesting examples of dynamic, successful companies in this field.
Over the years, they have developed lines of teas and herbal teas that have become very popular with con­ sumers both here in Canada and abroad.
However, as they are an integral part of the business of tea-processing compa­ nies, herbal teas have been included for pur­ poses of this analysis.
13 www.tea.ca (data from A.C. Nielsen survey, April 2000).
Expertise and New Products New consumer trends that favour better coffees are forcing producing countries to refocus their output to satisfy world demand for both quantity and quality.
Recent concerns about fair-trade coffee14 are also part of a response to this new reality.
Since the fall of 2000, Van Houtte has been distributing coffee certified fair trade and organic.
Since October 2000, Starbucks, the world leader, has been supplying Fair Trade Certified Coffee to its 2,300 outlets in the U.S., after reaching an agreement with TransFair USA, an accredited independent certifi­ cation organization.
Meeting consumers’ increasing demands today means using leading-edge roasting equipment and developing new blends.
The problem of preserving roasted coffee in sales outlets has been partially solved, thanks to vacuum packaging with a valve that helps keep the product fresh.
For sales to consumers who wish to blend their own, improvements to display cases in supermarkets now prevent beans from leaving oil residue on the glass, enhancing both freshness and consumers’ perception of the coffee.
The response of Kraft Canada (under the brand name General Foods International Coffees) and Nestlé (Nescafé) to shifts in consumer preference to specialty coffees has been to position mainly instantcoffee-based products in this niche.
Hence, French vanilla, Viennese chocolate, hazelnut and similar instant coffees, as well as instant cappuccino, have been taking up more shelf space.
In the ready-to-drink coffee segment, Starbucks has had spectacular success with its Frappuccino brand iced coffee, sold in grocery and convenience stores, which combines the characteristics of refreshing drinks with those of coffee.
In the U.S., growth in this category has slowed recently, however, with sales rising a mere 2% in 199915.
Keep in mind that this segment still represents under 1% of the volume of coffee consumed.

Tea is undoubtedly well suited to the development of new flavoured drinks.
Beyond the traditional lemon flavouring, new drinks may have ginseng, ginkgo, guarana, echinacea, or other ingredients added, another step in the direction of functional foods.
A major share of the recent growth in tea-based drinks in the U.S. is due to their alleged beneficial and functional properties.
Ready-to-drink teabased beverages now account for 20%16 of the U.S. tea market and sales rose 8% in 1999.
Ready-to-drink iced tea is a major component of this dynamic market.
Intensive marketing by Snapple (owned by Cadbury-Schweppes) has certainly helped breathe new life into this segment.
In response to this initiative, the big beverage makers have formed partnerships with the best-known brands in the field, and have thus been able to rapidly develop new products and grab a large share of the market.
These brands include Nestea (Coca-Cola), Lipton (Pepsico) and Tetley (Lassonde Industries).
Nestlé and CocaCola recently announced a realignment of their existing partnership and the creation of an independent unit called Beverage Partners Worldwide (BPW), in the hope of profiting internationally from the projected growth in new ready-to-drink beverages, especially those based on coffee, tea and herbs, and new "health" drinks.
The prime target of their initiative is Pepsico, which is comfortably the leader in the U.S., not only in coffee drinks (distribution of Starbucks Frappuccino) and tea drinks (Lipton and SoBe brands), but also in sports drinks (Gatorade).
The SoBe brand gives it a significant presence in the alternative drinks niche.
All these efforts attest to the fierce competition among soft drink manufacturers to dominate the entire beverage industry.
Aside from the types of beverages already dis­ cussed, the competition extends to soft drinks, fruit juices, bottled water, and soon, milk-based drinks.
Van Houtte remains the biggest seller of premium coffee in Canada and the only one operating nation wide, since its 1998 acquisition of the Gold Cup Coffee Company of British Columbia.
Individually, roasting companies cover some or most of the distribution niches, that is, coffee houses, food wholesalers and retailers, the food services market, office coffee services, and catalogue or Internet sales.
In late 1999, Second Cup was considering putting itself up for sale in an effort to find a partner with the capital required to ensure its growth
throughout North America.
Second Cup anticipates opening 15 to 20 outlets in Canada in the next year.
In Quebec, Van Houtte supplies the largest chain of coffee houses (73 outlets as of August 1, 2000).
Given the competition in terms of location and decor from Second Cup and Starbucks, as well as from several local competitors, including Café Dépôt and Café Suprême, Van Houtte has launched a modernization and rationalization plan for its affiliated coffee houses.
Although they generate only 1% of company revenue, this initiative has become necessary to preserve its market share and brand recognition.
Starbucks Coffee Company, the world’s leading gourmet coffee retailer, with over 3,800 outlets, has scarcely made a dent in the market in Quebec and the rest of Canada.
The company has only five points of sale in Quebec, most of them coffee bars.
But Starbucks recently revealed its medium-term goals, which are to have a chain of 75 coffee houses in Quebec within the next four years17.
To this end, it has found a local partner (Interaction Restaurants, which operates Pizza Hut restaurants) to facilitate its penetration of the Quebec market.
With the arrival of this North American and world leader, the compe­ tition should heat up a notch and operators may feel some downward pressure on their profit margins.
Prospects for Quebec’s Food and Beverage industry Tea and Coffee Industry
Van Houtte:
A Remarkable Success Story!
Thanks to an aggressive acquisition strategy, Van Houtte has become the biggest Canadian premium coffee roaster.
It is also first in Canadian office coffee services, with a dominant market share.
This niche repre­ sents 70% of sales, with the rest coming from roasting, distribution and the sale of equipment.
The company, with revenue of $250 M i n 1999–2000, intends to continue its North American expansion in the office coffee niche, thanks to its leadership in manufacturing single-cup brewing equipment (VKI Technologies) and in office coffee services that use the technology.
In 1999, the company invested $8 M in its roasting facilities and its single-cup brewer manufacturing plant (VKI Technologies) in order to meet the demand from the various marketing channels in which it operates.
In December 2000, Van Houtte announced that it had purchased a gourmet-coffee roasting plant in Kentucky from Proctor & Gamble.
This acquisition, which will boost its for fine coffee production capacity by 50%, is part of its North American expansion plan for its office coffee services and retail distribution busi­ nesses.
The company owes its success to its complementary areas of expertise, combining premium coffee, the manufacturing of high-tech brewing equipment, and its skill in providing office coffee services.
The resulting business strategy gives the company several distinct advantages, and it intends to leverage them to better serve North American consumers through many different distribution channels.
By capitalizing on this trend, com­ panies were able to make their various blends of coffee better known and establish brand-name recognition.
Up until then, the coffee industry had been dominated by the products of multinationals available in grocery stores or sold by food services.
This new trend allowed a company like Van Houtte to develop its coffee-bean distribution sys­ tem and its marketing methods.
Success is not always guaranteed, however.
For instance, Second Cup and Kraft had to give up a largescale project to distribute Second Cup coffee in Canadian supermarkets in the wake of mixed initial results18.
Second, the low cost of brewers such as coffee presses (Bodum), mocha coffee-makers and filter coffee systems (Melitta) has promoted the purchase of whole beans and specialities rather than instant coffee.
This coffee culture is found especially in the 18–50 age group and everything seems to indicate that these new habits are here to stay.
The two main obstacles faced by Quebec companies will be increased competition and more demanding customers with regard to the range and quality of the products on offer.
The industry will also have to show leadership in addressing social and environmental concerns associated with coffee supplies.
To take just one example of this strategy, in 1998, Kraft and Starbucks announced the formation of a long-term partnership to sell Starbucks brand coffee beans and ground coffee in stores throughout the U.S. and possibly internationally.
The challenge for a company like Van Houtte will be to ensure the success of its North American development strategy.
The sale of coffee beans in grocery stores, on the other hand, presents bigger obstacles, given the competition from major-league players like Kraft, Proctor & Gamble (Folgers) and Nestlé.
Van Houtte has focussed on gradual development of its presence in specific target markets.
In the tea segment, leadership will continue to be assumed by the multinationals that dominate the market (Unilever and Nestlé).
Speciality teas will enjoy strong sales growth, even though they account for only a small share of consumer purchases at present.
Yet Quebec processors would be well advised to concentrate their efforts in this direction.
While English specialty teas with such prestigious brand names as Twinings will continue to hold a dominant position, there will always be room for firms that are innovative and creative in selecting and presenting their products.
Think of the undeniable success of Leika Foods in this area.
Another challenge to the tea industry will be to benefit from the increased growth in consumption that coffee has brought about, both in coffee house chains and in food services.
The keys to success will be the quality of products offered and the training of employees responsible for retail service.
Market Information Canada Organic Agriculture Market Access Issues
Foreign markets such as the European Union (EU), the United States (US) and Japan are developing enforceable certification and accreditation systems according to their national standards to increase consumer confidence in organic production.
Imports from foreign countries must also meet these standards.
Canada is focussing on the priority markets and looking at a variety of options to enable the continuation of exports.
One option is the possibility of establishing equivalency agreements which would require the exporting country to have standards and accreditation/certification systems equivalent to those existing in the importing country.
As opposed to the EU, U.S. and Japan which have all developed mandatory organic certification systems, Canada has developed a voluntary system.
Even though the Canadian system is voluntary, it is expected that it will be recognized as equivalent based on compliance with international systems such as ISO-61 (3) for accreditation bodies and ISO-65 for certification bodies and standards.
CSNUMBER=25250&ICS1=3&ICS2=120&ICS3=20 The Canadian government will request equivalency recognition based upon foreign governments' directives.
This approach, which was recommended by industry, will allow negotiation of market access for all duly certified Canadian organic products, under the SCC accreditation system.
Agriculture and Agrifood Canada (AAFC), in collaboration with the SCC, the Canadian General Standards Board (CGSB), the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, will be drafting a submission in the summer of 2003 which will propose an equivalency arrangement with the European Commission.
The submission will be used as a model for future discussions with the U.S. and Japan.
It is important to be aware that access can be maintained in these three markets without negotiation by the government of equivalency agreements.
Foreign applicants will be evaluated based on the same criteria as domestic certifying agents.
There are three methods for imported products to be marketed in the U.S.:
• Certifying agents operating in the foreign country may apply for U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) accreditation.
Foreign applicants will be evaluated based on the same criteria as domestic certifying agents.
• Foreign certifying agents may receive recognition when USDA has determined, upon the request of a foreign government, that the foreign certifying agent's government authority is able to assess and accredit certifying agents as meeting the requirements of the National Organic Program (NOP).
• A foreign certifying agent may receive recognition as meeting requirements equivalent to the requirements of the NOP under an equivalency agreement between the U.S. and the foreign government.
• SCC-U.S.:
The SCC has entered into discussion with the United States (U.S.) for a partnership agreement.
The SCC-U.S. discussion started in March 2002.
The agreement is expected to emerge in 2003.
• COABC/U.S.:
The BC provincial accreditation body (Certified Organic Association of British Columbia - COABC) and the U.S. entered into discussion in early 2002.
The COABC-U.S. agreement is expected to emerge in 2003.
• CAQ/U.S.:
Products imported from a third country may be marketed only where:
• They originate in a third country appearing on the list drawn up by the Commission and were produced in a region or a production unit and under the examination of an inspection body specified, where appropriate, in the decision concerning the third country in question; and
• The competent authority or body in the third country has issued a certificate of inspection stating that the lot designated in the certificate was obtained within a system of production applying rules equivalent and was subject to a system of inspection recognized as equivalent.
• If countries are not on the EU approved list, in accordance with Article 11(6) of 2092/91, they may continue to export to the EU until December 31, 2005 if certain inspection measures can be met, including the requirements of EN45011.
The importer in a Member State shall be authorized by the competent authority of the Member State to market, until December 31, 2005, products imported from a third country not included in the list provided the importer furnishes the competent authority of the importing Member State with sufficient evidence that the imported products were manufactured according to equivalent production rules and were subject to inspection measures of equivalent effectiveness, and that such inspection measures will be permanently and effectively applied.
Japan's regulation allows certifying bodies in foreign countries, which do not have an equivalent system to the Japanese Agricultural Standards (JAS) grading system, to enter into a contract with a Registered Certification Organization to act on their behalf to ensure that imported organic products are in accordance with the specific JAS standards.
One of the requirements that the foreign certifying bodies would need to satisfy is to be accredited by the national government, local government or an international certification organization such as the ISO or the International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements.
There are three methods for appending the JAS symbol to imported products and labelling them "organic".
Two require that foreign countries have a grading system equivalent to the JAS grading system:
• Foreign Manufacturers or Foreign Production Process Managers certified by the Registered Foreign Certification Organization may conduct the grading in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the specific JAS standards and append the JAS symbol to their products for importation by Japanese importers.
This is limited to the countries which have been set forth by Ministry's Ordinance as having a grading system for agricultural and forest products equivalent to the JAS system.
• Importers, certified by a certification organization whose management system and facilities for handling imported products are in conformity with criteria stipulated by the Minister ("Certified Importer"), may append the JAS symbol for organic foods when accompanied by a certificate or duplicate copy issued by governmental organizations in foreign countries or corresponding institutions designated by the Minister.
This is limited to the countries which have been set forth by Ministry's Ordinance as having a grading system for agricultural and forest products equivalent to the JAS system.
One of the requirements that the Foreign Certification Organizations would need to satisfy is to be accredited by the national government, local government or an international certification organization such as the ISO or the International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements.
Provincial authorities will therefore have to be contacted, i.e. the Conseil d'Accréditation du Québec at http://www.caqbio.org/anglais/, in order to determine their special requirements.
In the framework of its Import Control Program, the Québec Accreditation Board (CAQ) has established a methodology for controlling organic agricultural and food products coming from outside of Québec.
The program applies to all agricultural and food products bearing a reserved designation and coming from outside of Québec, whether they are sold to intermediaries or directly to Québec consumers (in the form of fresh or processed products), or used as ingredients by food processors based in Québec.
As of July 1st, 2003, new rules will apply.
Details pertaining to these rules are published in the CAQ's Import Control Program, which can be accessed on the CAQ's web site (www.caqbio.org) Domestic bilateral discussions:
SCC-CAQ partnership agreement:
The SCC has entered into discussion with the Conseil d'accréditation du Québec (CAQ) for partnership agreements.
The discussion started in September 2001.
The partnership agreement is expected to emerge in 2003.
As is the case of all foods sold in Canada, imported organic products are subject to the relevant regulated requirements such as the Food and Drugs Act, the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act and specific regulations described under the Canadian Agricultural Products Act.
These two acts include provisions that prohibit deceptive labelling of foods as regards their method of production, food safety, characteristics, value, etc.
• Canada is in the process of revising its national standard to make it the best in the world (compared to US, European Union standards and Codex guidelines) and to provide equivalent assurances to consumers that the organic products meeting this standard are produced without the use of synthetic pesticides, hormones or genetically produced seed.
• Canada has adopted the guidelines of ISO/IEC Guide 65 for activities relating to the certification of organic products.
So far, the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) has accredited two Canadian certification bodies, i.e. OC/PRO and OPAM..
• Canada's accreditation and certification system is voluntary.
The SCC does not force any Certification body to be accredited by them.
• Under this system, Canada does not make any real distinction between an organic food and a traditional food.
In other words, any exporter, importer or dealer wishing to sell organic products in Canada is not required to comply with the Canadian organic standard.
The only mandatory requirements are those relating to regulations for conventional products (phytosanitary, marking, bilingualism, etc.).
• Attention:
Some Canadian importers may require organic products to be certified before they enter Canada.
These buyers are major food chains for the most part.
Occasionally they may require products to be certified according to certain requirements.
It is important, therefore, that the Certification body being used comply with these requirements before the products enter Canada.
• The foreign Certification body does not have to be accredited by the SCC.
The use of generic brand names specific to organic is not regulated in Canada.
This requirement will depend once again on your buyer.

Foreword The Filière biologique du Québec promotes the development and expansion of Quebec's organic food sector in a spirit of cooperation and joint action.
Part of its mandate is to ensure that the sector has access to strategic planning that reflects its members' needs and aspirations.
The planning process that led to the formulation of the second strategic plan for the sector was a great opportunity for us to pool our knowledge and share our needs.
It resulted in the establishment of priorities for the sector over the next five years, taking account of the international and provincial contexts.
It has also given representatives of each link in the organic food system an opportunity to exchange ideas on development objectives and constraints for each link.
Such exchanges were based on the standards and values that are the foundation of sector development.
A consensus was reached on concrete measures in the five development directions retained (regulatory framework, organization of marketing, professional and technical support, financial support and genetically modified organisms).
The application of regulations requires, more than ever, the greater participation of all the links in the system.
A review of the business links between Quebec stakeholders is needed to ensure that marketing is organized properly.
Professional and technical support is essential to increase market sourcing by Quebec products.
Lastly, in a context in which organic food firms in many countries benefit from significant development subsidies, financial support must be increased to maintain the competitiveness of Quebec organic products on the world stage.
Regarding the threat of genetically modified organisms to the development of Quebec's organic food sector, participants were unanimous in emphasizing the need for realistic short-term solutions.
As chair of the Filière, I am proud to present this second strategic plan, the primary objective of which is to significantly increase the production, processing and marketing of organic products from Quebec.
I believe that the participation of all the partners in the sector is essential to make the plan into an effective collective development tool.
The cooperative efforts that went into producing the plan demonstrate that the sector has acquired the maturity required to implement the plan.
The organic designation is the first reserved designation to be instituted in Quebec.
In many respects, the organic sector is a pioneer in this area.
Quebec society as a whole has a responsibility to support the successful development of the organic sector, so that the experience gained paves the way for other reserved designations.
The support given will also help the organic food sector to fully assume its responsibilities to consumers, who are increasingly open to products with a reserved designation.
I, myself, am convinced that the second strategic planning exercise for the sector will help to mobilize all individuals interested in supporting the development of Quebec organic foods.
By working together, we will be able to successfully implement the strategies mapped out in this new plan.
Introduction Organic foods are a product of organic agriculture.
Organic agriculture is based on agricultural planning and management practices that aim to create healthy ecosystems and ensure sustainable productivity.
Weeds and pests are controlled without using synthetic pesticides and herbicides but by maintaining a diversity of interdependent life forms that ensure a balanced ecosystem.
Insects and diseases can be controlled by promoting balanced host-predator relations, increasing populations of beneficial insects, using biological controls and crop control agents, and carrying out the mechanical elimination of pests and damaged portions of plants.
In organic farming, soil fertility is maintained and improved through a system that maximizes biological activity in the soil, in order to provide plants and animals with essential nutrients as well as to conserve soil resources.
The use of chemical fertilizers is prohibited because it usually disturbs biological soil activity.
Crop selection and rotation, water management and the recycling of crop and livestock residues are basic practices in organic farming.
Owing to a combination of all these elements, organic products are generally recognized as healthy food produced in a healthy environment.
Polls in Quebec and elsewhere show that consumers are more and more aware of food quality and increasingly link their health to the food they eat.
This is why many consumers now chose to buy organic products.
The fact that organic production is associated with environmental sustainability is also increasing consumer interest in organic products.
As a result, in Quebec, the organic food sector is recognized as a well-differentiated and promising market niche that should be developed further.
Worldwide, the current demand for a number of organic products is outstripping supply.
In Quebec, the strong demand is bringing new players into the market, accentuating the need to reconsider support and funding for the sector.
In a business environment favourable to its growth, the organic sector must be ready to overcome the significant challenges posed by greater market sourcing.
Quebec certainly has a number of strengths that it can draw on to face the new market realities.
The sector now has everything it needs to accelerate its development, due to extensive know-how acquired over more than three decades by organic producers and processors, a certification system recognized in a number of markets and the ability of all the major players in the system to work together successfully.
The first strategic plan for Quebec's organic sector dates back to 1994.
The numerous changes that have occurred since then prompted the updating and renewal of the strategic plan.
A strategic plan emphasizing growth 2.1 The strategic planning process To ensure that the 2004-2009 strategic plan accurately reflects the needs of the sector, the Filière biologique du Québec decided to get a number of representatives of the different links in the system involved in the planning process.
The four phases of the process consisted of a context analysis phase, consultation phase (involving roughly 550 people), strategic reflection phase (involving roughly 60 people) and a decision-making phase involving the members of the Table filière biologique.
Participants in the planning process emphasized the importance of never losing sight of the cornerstone of organic farming, which is to produce high-quality food in an environmentally sustainable way.
2.2 Vision The consultations and exchanges that took place during the strategic planning exercise revealed a number of common elements on which the vision of the sector's future would be based.
Process participants clearly expressed their desire to have Quebec's organic food sector recognized for:
• its positive contribution to the environment and health;
• the integrity of the organic designation;
• the wide variety of its products and the accessibility to products in the Quebec market;
• the dynamism of its leaders in the Canadian and export markets.
2.3 Growth objectives In accordance with the sector's vision for its future, five major objectives were set for growth:
• increase to 80%, by 2009, the degree of consumer confidence in the organic designation in Quebec;
Given the growth of the organic sector in recent years, it is realistic to expect the sector as a whole to achieve these objectives.
To be able to measure the progress made in achieving these objectives, indicators must be identified for each growth objective by the beginning of the implementation phase.
2.4 Development directions The Filière biologique du Québec conducted a survey of 550 people representing each of the links in the organic food system to determine their primary concerns and take them into account in strategic planning for 2004-2009.
A total of 495 responses on development issues were received, 44% of which referred to the organization of marketing; 26%, professional and technical support; 14%, financial support and 10%, the regulatory framework.
The five major challenges identified in the consultations were translated into the following development directions:
• improve the implementation of the regulatory framework for the organic designation in Quebec;
• develop local and regional marketing structures and facilitate access to international markets;
• increase professional and technical support to established and transitional organic firms;
• improve financial support to the organic food sector;
• mitigate the potential negative impacts of GMOs on the quality of, and trade in, organic food.
2.5 Implementation of the plan The Filière biologique du Québec is responsible for coordinating the implementation of the 2004-2009 strategic plan for the organic food industry.
The Filière must ensure that the strategies enumerated in the plan are implemented by the partners who are in the best position to carry them out.
Consequently, it will interview representatives of the organic farming community, governments and organizations that could potentially be involved in implementing the plan.
In addition, the new strategic plan should be used to guide financial support provided to the industry.
In addition, the plan must include indicators for monitoring the progress made in achieving growth and strategic objectives.
The results achieved under the plan will be described in an annual report to be submitted to the Filière biologique du Québec.
The report will be disseminated as widely as possible to partners associated with the development of the sector, eventually allowing the strategic plan to be updated if required.
By adopting this method of implementing the plan, partners have chosen to pool their efforts and resources for the greater good of the entire sector.
The plan will be implemented in a spirit of cooperation and joint action.
Regulatory framework for the organic designation 3.1 Context In recent years, the increasing quantity of organic products from around the word and particularly the increased number of points of sale has made consumers much more demanding in terms of the integrity of organic labelling.
This is why the control of the organic designation is so important to ensure the credibility of organic foods.
Internationally, the Codex Alimentarius Commission has adopted a set of guidelines, entitled Guidelines for the Production, Processing, Labelling and Marketing of Organically Produced Foods.
These guidelines outline the minimum standards that must be met for a food product to be considered organic in most countries of the world.
However, the Codex Alimentarius Commission has not yet set standards for organic maple syrup production, which complicates the regulatory framework for this type of production, so important in Quebec.
Between 50 and 60 countries have regulations on certification requirements for organic agricultural and food products or are in the process of adopting such regulations.
In December 2002, the United States adopted its National Organic Program, under which certification is mandatory.
In the European Union, regulations stipulate that minimum standards must be met, and each country has its own standards which must be at least as strict as the general rules and accompanied by provisions for mandatory certification.
In Asia, regulations have traditionally been few and far between, although the situation is changing rapidly.
In Japan, regulations effective April 2001 set strict national standards for the organic food industry, reducing the size of the organic food market from $3 billion US in 2000 to $250 million US in 2001.
The upgrading of Japanese standards to bring them in line with international ones has meant increased differentiation of organic and nonorganic products.
China is in the process of adopting its own regulations for the organic food sector.
The Canadian government has not yet adopted regulations to make certification mandatory.
A voluntary Canadian standard for organic agriculture was established in June 1999, which is administered by the Standards Council of Canada.
In terms of product labelling, there are no Canadian standards that specifically cover organic food.
Organic labelling standards therefore vary depending on the individual certification body but always involve the organic food content.
In addition, all food sold in Canada is subject to the provisions of the Food and Drugs Act, Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act and regulations on specific products under the Canada Agricultural Products Act.
These laws and regulations have provisions forbidding the mislabelling of food.
For organic food, authority over labelling under these laws and regulations is fairly limited in actual fact.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) does very little verification of the labelling of organic foods and the degree of action taken varies depending on the province.
For example, in Quebec, the CFIA does not act to control the labelling of organic foods while, in other provinces, it has initiated proceedings in several cases.
The role of the Canadian government and its agencies with respect to compliance monitoring of organic food is therefore very limited.
This can be explained in part by the regulatory vacuum.
3.2 Situation in Quebec 3.2.1 ACCREDITATION SYSTEM An Act respecting reserved designations creates a framework in Quebec for the recognition and protection of designations given to agricultural and food products, including organic products.
Under the Act, the Quebec Accreditation Board (QAB) has a mission to provide accreditation to certification bodies, make recommendations to the Minister regarding the recognition of designations and monitor how the latter are used.
In December 1999, the QAB was specifically mandated to control the use of the organic designation, which became a reserved designation in February 2000.
Quebec's regulatory framework for organic agriculture is more advanced than those in the other provinces.
The QAB adopted the Quebec Organic Reference Standards, which are equivalent to, if not stricter than, those adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission.
The QAB reviews and updates these standards every year.
It is responsible for accrediting various certification bodies based on these standards and ISO Guide 65 on requirements for product certification.
QAB accreditation gives certification bodies the right to grant in Quebec certificates of organic conformity to firms that produce, process or package agricultural and food products to be sold with the organic designation.
Up to now, the QAB has accredited six certification bodies for Quebec products.
Over 20 other agencies have been recognized by the QAB as being qualified to certify products imported into Quebec.
Certification ensures consumers that the food they buy was produced and certified according to international standards.
The granting of a certificate of conformity to a firm involves five steps.
If a firm wants to obtain organic certification, it must first request from the certification body of its choice the latter's standards concerning production and processing principles and methods.
Applicants must then submit their own production and processing specifications to the certification body.
If the specifications meet the standards, the certification body will conduct an on-site audit to ensure that the firm's production system actually conforms to the approved specifications and whether the organic standards are being met.
The certification body will then render its decision based on the audit results.
When a firm is issued a certificate of conformity, it obtains the right to use the certification body's trademark.
The name of the certification body must appear on the product label, while the certification body's logo is optional.
3.2.2 CONTROLLING THE USE OF THE RESERVED DESIGNATION To perform its mandate of controlling the use of the organic designation in the province of Quebec, the QAB administers a monitoring program which, since 2000, has targeted mainly Quebec products.
Until recently, requirements for products from outside Quebec have been limited to including the certification body's name on the label.
Beginning on July 1, 2003, products from outside Quebec must meet the requirements of the new Quebec product entry acceptance program and therefore be certified by an organization accredited or recognized by the QAB.
Regardless of the origin of the product, the party ultimately responsible for marketing the product in Quebec is required to comply with QAB requirements.
Offenders are identified through a complaint management system.
To follow up on a complaint, QAB representatives must visit the retailer and file a report, identifying the party ultimately responsible for marketing the product targeted by the complaint.
Generally, this party is the one considered to be in violation of the Act.
If the QAB representative deems the complaint to be well founded, he or she will communicate with the offender to require that steps be taken to correct the situation.
If the problem is not corrected, the QAB will transfer the case to the Quebec Attorney-General for legal action.
In the case of legal action, the process may be long as in any other judicial proceedings.
In 2002, over 40 complaints were filed against offenders.
In most cases, offenders corrected the situation after having been notified by the QAB.
Despite these positive results, the complaint- management based control system has a few weak areas.
In three years, the context has evolved to the extent that changes must be made to the current system to increase the rate of compliance among products sold to consumers.
The number of retail outlets has also increased from a few hundred in 2000 to several thousand in 2003, resulting in increased monitoring requirements.
The QAB does not have the resources required to respond to these growing needs.
Furthermore, the Act does not give the QAB the inspection authority it needs to enter infraction sites closed to the public (processors that export products or wholesalers that repackage products).
In these cases, the QAB is forced to transfer the case to the Quebec Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPAQ) for investigation.
If the results of the investigation are conclusive, MAPAQ will transfer the case to the Attorney-General for legal action.
The fact that legal action leading to possible conviction is a fairly long process has led a number of organic sector stakeholders to question the deterrent effect that such a system can have in the short term.
However, despite problems with the monitoring system, almost twice as many Quebecers have confidence in organic labelling (organic designation) (51%) as Canadians in the rest of the country, according to a Leger Marketing survey carried out among 1,500 adult Canadians from June 4 to 9, 2002.
The mandatory enforcement of the Act respecting reserved designations (compared with the voluntary nature of federal standards) could explain in part these results.
Up to now, the willingness of most players in the Quebec organic market to comply with the current regulatory control system has no doubt helped to strengthen the confidence of Quebec consumers.
3.3 Elements of strategic reflection The regulatory framework is essential to the development of organic agriculture since the future of this type of agriculture depends on consumer choices on one hand and, on the other, the ability of the different links in the chain to maintain a system in which consumers have confidence.
The consultation and reflection phases revealed the fact that representatives of the production, processing, distribution and retail sectors all shared the same concern over the degree of control provided by the regulatory framework.
The current regulations are the cornerstone of the sector's development.
In Quebec, MAPAQ has supported the development of the QAB and its programs during the last three years through direct funding arrangements and the organic agricultural support program.
The organic sector now has the structure required to control the use of the organic designation.
However, due to the rapid growth of the sector and the entry of new firms at all links in the system, even greater coordination efforts are required to ensure that those enforcing the regulations are able to perform their roles properly.
Changes are required in the monitoring system, which currently is based on a complaint management system, so that it responds better to the current situation and the needs of industry and the public.
The growing interest of firms and consumers in organic foods, along with the diversity and quantity of these foods on grocery shelves, means that consumers need to know more about their nature and characteristics, and certification and labelling methods.
A number of stakeholders have cited the lack of information available in these areas.
Action must be taken quickly to ensure that the paucity of information does not generate mistrust in the integrity of organic food.
Sector representatives have also highlighted small producers' and processors' needs for financial support to obtain certification.
Currently, firms bear the entire financial burden of certification and it would be beneficial to develop cost-sharing methods to allow these firms to compete with their counterparts in other countries.
Regarding certification bodies, two serious problems have been raised.
The first is the wide range of existing standards, which slows down the annual administrative process of recognizing standards.
Certification bodies believe that they have to invest far too much effort to obtain recognition and would like uniform standards to facilitate their work.
The second problem is the difficulty that certification bodies have in retaining experienced auditors, given the seasonal nature of the work and the poor pay.
Again, solutions will have to be found for this in the near future.
4 To achieve more consistent audit quality, increase auditors' expertise and better retain their know-how by: 1. giving auditors access to affordable training that takes account of the complexity of their task; 2. helping to find and implement ways to improve auditors' working conditions based on the needs they have expressed.
Organization of marketing 4.1 Context A significant increase in the demand for organic food products worldwide coincides in part with concerns raised by the public over the problems linked to mad cow disease in Europe and the increased use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food.
These issues, which have been reported widely in the media, have helped increase consumers' awareness of the links between health, the environment and food quality.
Although the demand for organic food has matured in Europe, it is only at the beginning of its growth cycle in North America.
Although organic food has been available on North American markets for 40 years, it was of limited importance until the late 1990s.
During the past decade, North American consumers' concerns with food safety and security have substantially increased.
As environmental concerns have come to the fore, this has created a situation conducive to strongly stimulating the demand for organic food in North America.
The international context has therefore favoured the sustained growth of markets for the past ten years in the organic food sector (over 20% annually).
Currently, the forecast is for roughly 30% annual growth in North America in the next few years, while the net growth for the food industry should be less than 2%.
Indeed, rapid sustained growth can be expected in a number of organic production sectors.
This situation is of increasing interest to new players, opening the door to new business opportunities and requiring the better organization of marketing.
The cornerstone of international trade in organic products is the recognition of certification programs, which is done on a reciprocal country-to-country or government-to-government basis, based on mandatory standards.
However, in Canada, organic labelling is based on a voluntary standard, which hinders recognition by other countries.
This situation is causing problems for Quebec exporters of organic products, who operate under rigorous mandatory standards.
Nevertheless, Quebec exports are faring relatively well, due to the recognition of Quebec certification programs by importing nations' certification bodies.
Although Quebec organic products technically meet the requirements of importing countries, changes expected in 2005 could have serious repercussions on Quebec exports.
At that time, exporting countries will be required to be on a list of third countries operating under mandatory standards in order to export to Europe or Asia.
4.2 Situation in Quebec Thanks to the pioneering work done by Quebec's organic sector, the province has developed a level of expertise that can sustain significant development in the sector.
These pioneers gradually succeeded in positioning their organic products with retailers specializing in natural products and health foods.
These retailers have expanded over the years and are taking advantage of the growing demand for organic products in Quebec.
In 2002, Quebec's three main retail food chains adopted market development plans for organic food in their supermarkets.
Organic food is no longer considered a fad but rather a legitimate market niche with a promising future.
Loblaws is planning to double, in 2003, the number of organic products offered in its grocery stores, from 150 to 300 products.
Metro is also working to introduce or widen the range of organic products in its stores, while Sobeys has been continually increasing the shelf space devoted to organic products.
Even though these major distribution networks are taking on growing importance in organic markets, some producers still prefer formulas involving shorter distribution networks.
Sales of organic food baskets through the community supported agriculture (CSA) network, the Réseau de l'agriculture soutenue par la communauté, are a good example.
In 2002, this network, which comprises over 40 farms, accounted for 3% of the market for organic products.
According to the organization Équiterre, the CSA system provides farmers with sales revenues that are 25% greater than those from other distribution networks.
For consumers, this system ensures access to healthy, locally produced food at competitive prices.
In recent years, supply management initiatives have also been introduced in Quebec and appear to provide good results.
They are paving the way for an examination of new ways of supplying markets.
It is important to remember that exports account for most organic food sales in Quebec, while domestic demand is met mainly through imports.
4.3 Elements of strategic reflection Until very recently, most organic foods produced in Quebec were exported due to the lack of accessible distribution networks domestically.
Except for direct sales (from producer to consumer), individual organic producers are often unable to meet the requirements of Quebec's domestic market.
When a strong interest arises in developing the Quebec market, it will be imperative to create networks to rapidly disseminate information and to create regional structures to be able to supply greater volumes to Quebec markets.
In addition, many producers would clearly like to sell more of their products for processing, to avoid being overdependent on seasonal markets.
Processors, for their part, would like to have consistent access to Quebec products.
The time seems ripe, therefore, for establishing new commercial links benefiting both parties.
In recent years, Quebec consumers have been warned about the importance of eating high-quality food.
Now they are trying to become better informed about food production.
Similarly, the mass arrival of organic products on grocery store shelves has prompted consumer interest in organic farming.
They want to know more about the difference between organic and other types of food.
Representatives of various links in the organic food system, who have contacts with the public, have confirmed consumers' need for more information and their own inability to respond to this need as individuals.
This is why some stakeholders are lobbying for a logo indicating that organic products come from Quebec.
They believe that the logo must contain a reference to the reserved designation and should not exclude certification marks, which guarantee compliance with standards.
In addition, although the logo could have a local connotation, it should not preclude exports.
Internationally, the recognition of QAB-accredited certification bodies by the U.S. National Organic Program (NOP) is facilitating trade with the United States.
The same flexibility does not exist, however, with European and Aisian countries.
By 2005, a country will have to be on the list of third countries to be able to export to Europe and Japan.
To be included on the list, the competent authority-i.e., the government of the country in question-must request official recognition.
The fact that, up to now, the Canadian approach has been based on voluntary standards and therefore does not meet international criteria has made it difficult to position Canadian organic products in European and Japanese export markets.
This situation could worsen in 2005 if solutions are not found soon.
The Canadian Organic Coalition, formed in 2002, is lobbying for a mandatory certification system for Canadian organic products.
This change in direction in the industry in the rest of Canada could modify the Canadian negotiating position with the European Union.
4 Facilitate access by Quebec organic firms to export markets through Canadian regulations that comply better with international requirements by: 1. intensifying pressure by the Filière biologique du Québec on the Canadian government, to encourage it to develop a regulatory tool that harmonizes with provincial tools; 2. supporting, where appropriate, the work of the Canadian Organic Coalition, which is calling for mandatory Canadian regulations for the organic food sector.
Professional and technical support 5.1 Context During the past decade, organic producers in Europe and the United States have received more technical and professional support than their Canadian (and Quebec) counterparts.
Furthermore, these regions' support structures are better established than they are here, which is a factor that works against Quebec competitiveness.
Despite this, the low level of professional and technical support provided to the organic sector has not prevented Quebec producers and processors who are convinced of the soundness of organic farming methods from pursuing the organic option.
Currently, there are over 700 organic producers and roughly 100 organic processors in Quebec.
Current market signals, which point to a sustained growth in demand for organic products, bear out the perseverance and determination of these entrepreneurs.
Due to the favourable context, organic firms can now hope to obtain better professional and technical support from governments and the rest of the community in coming years.
Therefore, exports offer significant added value.
In addition, due to the vagaries of the weather in 2002 in Europe and the United States, the competition from these two regions will be less intense over the short term.
These factors will increase Quebec farmers' interest in organic agriculture and may also help encourage organic start-ups.
However, three to five years from now, new organic producers will find it harder to get established, as markets expand and downward pressure on prices begins.
In addition, more organic produce will begin arriving from emerging nations.
China, for example, is currently attempting to break into the North American market with low-priced organic products of variable quality.
Other countries, such as Brazil, India and Argentina, are doing the same, putting increased pressure on some Quebec products with a high growth potential such as protein crops.
5.2 Situation in Quebec In Quebec, the need for professional and technical help affects established organic firms, firms that want to convert to organic agriculture and new firms planning to engage in organic production.
5.2.1 SUPPORT TO FARMING ENTERPRISES Established organic firms need support to grow and are also highly sought after by new firms and transitional firms needing help.
The growing needs of new and transitional firms are posing an increasing problem, both for the producers who are constantly asked for assistance and the firms needing help.
In the case of farming enterprises that are in the process of converting or plan to convert to organic farming, access to adequate support during the transition phase is a major challenge for the sector.
Quebec standards universally require a transition period of three years.
These three years are a critical time for firms, which risk having their income decrease without their products necessarily gaining added value.
The ideal process in Quebec to encourage farm producers to convert to organic agriculture consists of a fair amount of outreach, adequate training, customized professional and technical support and a number of trial runs allowing the firm to convert gradually to organic forming.
The Fédération d'agriculture biologique du Québec (FABQ) is the largest organization of organic producers in the province, with close to 200 members.
Established in 1989, the FABQ joined the Union des producteurs agricoles (UPA) in 2001.
Its mission is to represent organic producers and act to promote organic farming in the agricultural community and among governments, consumers and various stakeholders.
The agents' role is to ensure the effective dissemination of information on organic farming and liase with other partners in the sector.
They also promote an awareness of organic agriculture among farm producers and provide technical information.
However, the department's consulting services are still not oriented towards organic agriculture to any degree.
MAPAQ also supports the operations of 23 technical support clubs (clubs d'encadrement technique or CET).
Along with the Conseil de développement de l'agriculture du Québec, it also provides financial support to 80 agri-environmental clubs (clubs agroenvironnementaux or CAE).
Although the mandate of these clubs does not include a specific organic farming component, they have assisted in facilitating the gradual transition of a number of farming enterprises to organic agriculture.
The cultural practices encouraged in these clubs allow producers to gain confidence in certain production methods similar to those advocated in organic farming.
In 2002, the technical support and agri-environmental clubs provided support to roughly 200 of the province's 700 organic farms.
Among the members of the agri-environmental clubs are 50 transitional farms, as well as 20 established organic farms.
There is also an agri-environmental club specializing in maple sugar production, with 35 members who are established organic producers and 15 who are in transition.
These clubs therefore provide very significant technical and professional support to organic producers and transitional firms.
5.2.2 INFORMATION ON ORGANIC SECTOR Quebec's organic farming centre, the Centre d'agriculture biologique du Québec (CABQ), plays a key role in disseminating specialized information through its magazine Bio-bulle and its Web site.
It also produces La Rubrique biologique, a strategic watch bulleting focusing on the organic agriculture industry; the information gathered provides a real benefit to the sector by assisting in strategic planning.
In addition, CABQ produces the RUAAB, a directory of firms and associations in Quebec's organic sector.
In terms of specialized references for the organic sector, the Agri-info bookstore in St. Hubert offers a wide variety of documents and a reference service for producers.
In February 2003, the FABQ produced the first general guide on converting to organic agriculture in Quebec, which was widely disseminated to firms and stakeholders.
The guide meets very important basic needs.
However, in the future, specialized guides targeting specific production sectors will be needed to meet more specific needs.
In terms of technical information, Quebec's reference centre on the agricultural and agri-food industry, the Centre de référence en agriculture et agroalimentaire du Québec (CRAAQ), has developed a Web site on organic farming, which is available through Quebec's agricultural web-ring, Agri-Réseau.
These worthwhile and promising initiatives should be followed closely and merit active participation.
5.2.3 TRAINING The current demand for agricultural training comes mainly from established producers wanting customized training.
The network of agricultural trainers, funded by Emploi Québec and regional institutions, plays an important role in organizing courses to respond to these needs.
Since 1987, the Victoriaville CEGEP has offered a DCS program in the organic cultivation of fruits and vegetables under a program called Managing and Operating Farm Enterprises.
The demand for courses specifically on organic livestock production is still very weak, which often hinders institutions from offering new courses in this area.
In addition, the Collège de Sherbrooke is working to develop a 400-hour Attestation of Collegial Studies program for firms wishing to convert to organic agriculture and for young people working on farms that are interested in the sector.
This training could then be offered throughout Quebec through the Quebec Department of Education.
At the university level, the situation is slowly changing.
No Quebec university currently offers formal courses in organic agriculture as part of its regular curricula.
All too often, the degree to which future farmers become aware of organic methods depends on the professor's interest in organic farming.
In addition, there is an increasing need for training in management, trade, financing and marketing as they apply to the organic sector.
Receiving training in these areas surely provides an excellent basis for firms' success.
In 2002, it received $914,700 in federal funding.
In Quebec, a committee formed recently by the organic agriculture committee of CRAAQ, is currently studying research and development avenues that will help meet the needs of Quebec firms.
For the time being, Quebec firms rely on the results of US and European studies to demonstrate the credibility of organic foods in relation to conventional ones.
In the short term, however, basic research on organic agriculture must be increased.
5.3 Elements of strategic reflection The lack of professional and technical support for the organic farming sector in Quebec has limited access to the sector and has forced producers to integrate the various facets of support directly into their own activities.
This lack of organized support has also forced established producers to shoulder much of the responsibility of responding to the needs of firms starting up or in transition.
The substantial increase in these needs in recent years has resulted in corresponding pressures on experienced producers.
It is imperative, therefore, to develop a formula that recognizes the contributions of these producers in the sector's development so that they are fairly remunerated, to ensure that their expertise can continue to be accessed.
To supplement this expertise, tools must be developed to provide a structure for information needed by firms wishing to convert to organic farming.
The transition period, which usually takes three years, is a critical time for these firms.
To reduce the risks to these firms and maximize their chances of success, all forms of professional and technical support must be increased.
Support in the form of consulting services is also critical to the sector's future.
Producers currently use mostly group consulting services.
Stakeholders would like to see better knowledge networking and to see the services offered and available resources complement each other better.
They would also like to see ways to better disseminate information on the expertise developed up to now by consultants.
Training is also key in the development of organic production.
Changing training needs, which have accompanied the growth of the sector, now require that the training offered be better coordinated and more widely accessible.
In addition, management and marketing parameters that are indispensable to a firm's success must be included in training offerings.
In the area of technology transfer and research, sector representatives have stated clearly that there are weaknesses both in the organization of technology transfer and the development of basic research.
They hope that the means to remedy these shortcomings will be put in place quickly.
Financial support 6.1 Context During the last two decades, a number of European countries and several US states have become aware of the environmental and economic benefits of organic agriculture and have instituted policies to provide financial support for this type of farming.
On December 17, 2002, an action plan was submitted to the European Council of Ministers, consisting of activities to publicize organic products, information campaigns targeting the food service industry, the removal of obstacles to direct distribution, the improvement of the consulting services offered to producers' associations, funding for regional agricultural programs supporting organic agriculture, improvement of the EU's statistical databases on production and the improvement of the control and accreditation of organic certification bodies.
In the United States, the 2002 Farm Bill provides for substantial aid to the organic farming industry.
Included in the Farm Bill are such programs as the National Organic Certification Cost-Share Program and many measures to encourage research, including a provision allowing the organic industry to establish a national voluntary research and promotion program.
This program will allow organic farmers to redirect some of their income to research and promotion activities specifically involving the organic sector.
Canada currently has no policies to support the development of the organic sector.
Stakeholders in the organic community hope that the recent strategic planning for the organic agriculture and food sector will lead to the formulation of policies that include significant finanical measures for the sector.
In the summer of 2001, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada announced $1.4 million in funding to producers of organic products, through the Canadian Adaptation and Rural Development Fund and the Canadian Agriculture and Food International (CAFI) Program.
This should provide Canadian organic firms with better market access and allow them to increase their knowledge of organic agriculture.
The funding was used to produce handbooks on organic agriculture, to organize the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements World Congress and to create the Organic Agriculture Centre of Canada at the Nova Scotia Agricultural College in Truro, Nova Scotia.
In 2001, Quebec's organic sector received $350,000 in funding under federal programs.
6.2 Situation in Quebec In Quebec, as in other places around the world, pressure from citizens to mitigate the negative environmental impacts of traditional agriculture has prompted the government to adopt a sustainable agriculture policy.
However, up to now, the recognition of organic agriculture has not led to a specific policy for the sector or to direct funding measures for organic firms.
Sustained pressure from the Filière biologique du Québec, Union des producteurs agricoles (UPA) and the FABQ has prompted MAPAQ to establish, in cooperation with sector stakeholders, a program to support the development of organic agriculture, the Programme de soutien au développement de l'agriculture biologique.
The program has three components, based on development thrusts defined by a working group established by the department.
They consist of support for the certification system, for monitoring and control of the organic designation, for skills transfers to firms and for marketing adapted to the organic sector.
MAPAQ has several other programs which provide funding to the organic sector without targeting it specifically such as the joint action support program reserved for "Filière" organizations.
MAPAQ also funds access to consulting services through technical support and agri-environmental clubs.
It pays 55% of the annual fees of technical support club members and 33% of the fees of agri-environmental club members; the latter receive matching funding from the Conseil de développement de l'agriculture du Québec.
The Financière agricole du Québec is currently establishing a network of 23 liaison offers who will be better able to deal with requests from the organic sector.
Organic firms have access to funding, income stabilization, and crop insurance programs, as well as a net income stabilization account.
Evaluation criteria used in funding programs still do not accurately reflect the needs of organic firms and insurance programs are not adapted to the organic sector.
In the area of farm insurance programs, the Financière agricole has decided to look at various avenues for dealing with the organic sector, which involve adapting existing insurance programs or creating a new program.
The organic sector now includes a substantial number of firms, enough to envisage a separate program.
Growth of the sector will therefore be a determining factor in the issue of financial support.
To deal with the lack of financial support, some organic producers have developed a system of direct access for consumers, which allows farms to finance part of the year's production costs in advance.
This seemingly contradictory situation suggests that the links between health, the environment and organic agriculture are still not obvious enough to governments to induce them to invest more in the sector's development.
Therefore, it is crucial, in the short term, that the sector clearly demonstrates these links.
This effort should also include demonstrating the benefits of organic production for economic development.
The time is ripe for such a campaign, since market pressure has made the governments and the community more receptive to consideration of the sector's financial needs.
However, one program alone cannot meet the widely divergent needs in the sector.
The current environment, in which the role of organic agriculture is being increasingly recognized, provides a powerful incentive for the sector to get organized and seek the additional funding it needs for its development from other government programs.
On the federal side, financial support is still very limited, if not bordering on inexistent.
Industry representatives hope that significant trade pressures will prompt the government to establish a support structure competitive with that in other countries.
Such support is vital for the sector's positioning on export markets.
Under the new Agricultural Policy Framework, which will govern all future actions of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, no budget has been set aside for organic agriculture.
Genetically modified organisms 7.1 Context Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be defined as plants, animals or microorganisms in which the genetic material has been altered using biotechnology to confer characteristics that do not occur in nature.
The total area of cropland planted with transgenic crops around the world increased from 2.6 million hectares in 1996 to over 50 million in 2001.
No fewer than 13 countries are involved in this type of production, with the largest producers consisting of the United States, Argentina, Canada and China.
The transgenic production of these four countries represents 99% of the world's harvest of transgenic crops.
The United States alone produces 69% of the world total.
Although the tilled area planted with GMO crops increased rapidly from 1996 to 1998, the rate slowed significantly after this.
This is due to various factors, including the reluctance in some markets to buy these products and lower profitability for farmers than was originally predicted.
Despite this slowdown, significant research is being carried out in this sector, which is dominated by a handful of large agri-food firms.
Assessing the environmental risks of GMOs is not easy.
So many variables come into play that effects not seen in the laboratory may be observed in crops in the field and, conversely, problems observed in the lab may turn out to be inconsequential in the field.
Many experts believe that, in all cases, not only must absolute risks be assessed, but a comparison must be made with other cultural methods that could be substituted to achieve the characteristics or improvements that appear to be caused by the use of GMO crops.
In North America, the contamination of nontransgenic organisms with GMOs through naturally occurring wind or insect pollination is threatening both crop and seed production as well as the grain trade, to the point of handicapping our farmers on international markets.
North American products are losing ground abroad, because genetic contamination occurring through natural pollination is impossible to prevent.
North American (US and Canada) exports to Europe and Asia have dropped significantly since consumers in those areas are reluctant to buy products containing GMOs.
In Canada, agencies that assess and license transgenic crops and new foods are under the jurisdiction of the federal government.
Current laws and regulations on genetic engineering in Canada contain no limitations or restrictions to control genetic pollution, which is a growing threat, particularly to organic farming in Canada.
This situation has already made it impossible to produce organic canola in Canada, and soybeans and wheat could soon suffer the same fate if action is not taken soon.
7.2 Situation in Quebec 7.2.1 QUEBEC'S POSITION In general, Quebec consumers are worried about the introduction of GMOs in the environment and the food supply.
The moratorium on GMOs in the European Union and the gradual implementation of European regulations on the labelling and traceability of foods containing GMOs has only increased Quebec consumers' mistrust in this respect.
A number of organizations and experts in Quebec concerned by GMOs are demanding that the government provide reliable information on the impact of these crops on the environment.
There are also demands that genetically modified food be specifically labelled.
In November 2000, Quebec was the first province in Canada to support the adoption of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.
The main objective of the protocol is to ensure that the transboundary movement of living modified organisms (LMOs) does not have an adverse effect on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, given the risks to human health as well.
The protocol aims to protect biodiversity and regulate the international trade in living modified organisms (LMOs).
In Quebec, the Department of the Environment has been given the mandate to propose measures to protect the environment from GMOs.
Scientific issues around GMOs involve the need to develop expertise in Quebec in the scientific fields linked to GMOs and to develop other agricultural technologies that provide the same benefits as those originally targeted when developing GMOs but not the adverse effects.
The environmental impacts of GMOs on Quebec ecosystems and their socio-economic impacts must also be taken into account by the scientific community.
Social issues around GMOs involve the need to provide the general public with basic information on GMOs that is up to date and impartial and to hold structured consultations to allow citizens to express their concerns regarding GMOs.
Economic issues include the importance of evaluating the economic advantages of currently grown GMO crops compared with other types of production.
The Conseil believes it is essential to conduct business intelligence on an international scale to take advantage of potential opportunities to develop specific market channels in certain markets, both GMO and non-GMO.
Political issues involve recognizing the rights of all parties involved.
According to the Conseil, Quebec must receive assurance from the federal government that agencies the are involved in licensing and controlling GMOs are carrying out their respective duties compently, transparently and rigourously.
In addition, Quebec must have access to its own advisors providing guidance in strategic matters, hence the importance of building expertise and intelligence-gathering capability on the GMO issue within the Quebec government.
Lastly, ethical issues involve the legitimacy of human intervention on the foundations and resolution of the controversy, corporate concentration in the seed industry, the patentability of living organisms, the equitable sharing of costs and benefits and reconciling collective and individual interests.
7.3 Elements of strategic reflection It has now become evident that large-scale genetic contamination has already affected non-transgenic production in Quebec.
Transgenic crops have harmed not only trade but, in many cases, the ability of the North American agricultural sector to compete in foreign markets.
Genetic contamination represents a major threat to organic agriculture since the use of genetic engineering is prohibited in organic farming.
Consequently, the Filière biologique du Québec plans to give priority to the GMO issue, to prevent our organic sector from losing its competitiveness.
To do this, the Filière must formulate a clear position on protecting Quebec's organic sector from GMOs.
The Filière also intends to find ways to protect the integrity of organic products and promote these methods to the Quebec and federal governments.
The Filière would like both levels of government to acknowledge that GMOs pose a very serious threat to the development of organic agriculture and to act quickly to deal with the problem.
Lastly, in partnership with other organizations in Quebec and the rest of Canada, the organization plans to support demands to protect non-transgenic crops, particularly organic ones, from the negative impacts of GMOs.
2 Intensify demands to protect organic crops from the threat represented by GMOs by: 1. demanding that the Quebec government declare a moratorium on the use of transgenic crops in Quebec; 2. demanding that the Quebec government carry out an impact study on the effects of transgenic crops on the development of the organic sector in Quebec; 3. joining in Quebec and Canadian efforts to better control the use of GMOs.

According to a new market report, Global Confectionery 2006, by researchers Leatherhead Food International, the driving force and most innovative area within the confectionery industry has been health - as evidenced by Mars' decision to set up a health and well-being unit.
Published this month, the report notes that new product development has centred on creating healthier options to long-established favourite products such as gum and chocolate.
Demand for dark chocolate has increased, following evidence that it is better for heart health than milk or white chocolate due to its high concentration of natural flavanol and antioxidants.
And it's not just chocolate - health concerns have impacted on development across the sector with sugar-free gum and medicated sweets on the increase with Proctor and Gamble launching Red Energy bonbons which contain guarana, caffeine and taurine.
Gum marketed under the claim of having dental health benefits has proved popular as has confectionery fortified with vitamins and minerals.
In 2005, Wrigley launched its new Airwaves gum, fortified with guarana, menthol and green tea onto the French market and extended it to the UK at the start of the year.
Low fat and additive-free products have been prevalent on the market and nutritional ingredients such as green tea, seaweed and natural sugar alternatives have grown in use, especially in Japan, where Nestlé have released a Green Tea Kit Kat bar.
Other dominant trends in the market are the preference for convenience, with more 'eating-on-the-go' products, an emphasis on seasonality as chocolate is increasingly seen as a luxury purchase and greater moves towards targeting an adult audience in the face of falling birth rates in more developed areas of the world.
Packaging developments in 2005 reflected the need for convenience in the sector with handy sharing bags and smaller, more portable containers making an appearance.

FRUITS German blueberry harvest Due to unfavourable weather conditions, the supply of German blueberries will be smaller than expected.
Despite an increase of the cultivation area of 200 hectares to a total of 1,800 hectares, the Bonn-based market experts of ZMP do not anticipate the record amount of 10,000 tons to be realized - only about 8,000 tons, i.e. the same volume as in 2005.

RETAIL MARKET Own label food sector set to rocket Research analyst IGD claims that own label food and grocery products will account for more than a quarter of the market (26.8 per cent) across Europe within four years.
By 2010, Europeans will be spending around €430bn on supermarkets own brands, up 45 per cent from €298bn.
And this own brand revolution is increasingly creeping eastwards.
According to IGD, own label already accounts for £2 of every £5 spent in UK supermarkets, and is set to continue growing across Europe.
"The UK currently leads the way in terms of food and grocery own label," said Jonathan Gunz, senior international business analyst at IGD.
"The future growth in Europe will come from Russia and the rest of Eastern and Central Europe, where penetration levels are currently fairly low despite relatively large grocery market."
As a result, private label popularity is beginning to seriously challenge the reign of famous brands.
Branded products command a premium price for manufacturers compared to the foods they produce for private label retailers, piling the pressure on iconic brands to compete or lose valuable market share.
"Many marketers say that those brands in the middle, not premium or economy, will suffer as they are neither cheap nor groovy.
And for those manufacturers brand erosion is something very real," Datamonitor consumer analyst Matthew Adams recently told FoodandDrinkEurope.com. It may therefore be tempting for European producers to take on more private label orders so they can operate across both sectors and take advantage of the wide appeal of private ranges.
In the meantime the growing private label market share continues to hasten brand erosion.
Indeed, IGD believes that the trend towards own label is inexorable.
"Shoppers in Western Europe have seen for themselves how own label is taking up more and more shelf space," said Gunz.
"Categories like healthy eating, premium, value, organic and lifestyle have helped retailers own brands become much stronger.

Private label market share continues to rise The international trade show "World of Private Label", organised by the Private Label Manufacturers' Association (PLMA) and held in Amsterdam, continues to grow in significance.
This year a record-breaking 3,000 exhibitors from 60 countries took part in the show, which covered 27,000 m2 of net exhibition space.
This development mirrors the increasing private label market share throughout Europe, says PLMA president Brian Sharoff.
The show, now in its 21st year, welcomed 100 first time exhibitors.
All in all there were 30 national and regional stands, with Wales, Egypt and Slovakia represented 2006 for the first time.
According to the organisers 7,000 buyers, category managers and department heads serving Europen retailers and merchandisers had travelled to the Amsterdam show in May in order to find out more about current private label trends and concepts.
This is 1,000 more than the previous year.
Numerous confectionery manufacturers present Not only the "traditional" private label food range has been growing recently; the number of non-food products has also been increasing.
Numerous confectionery manufacturers make use of the show to display their private label competence.
At the PLMA "Idea Supermarket", a special exhibition held during the PLMA show, new private label projects and packaging from all over the world were on display.
Hundreds of items form leading retailers in Europe, the USA and elsewhere were showcased.
New ideas, new retail trends The "Idea Supermarket", which was introduced last year, was considerably expanded this year to include even more food and non-food articles.
In addition, an attractive seminar programme provided the very latest information and data.
Jeff Freeman, PLMA Research Director, previewed the International PLMA Yearbook, compiled by ACNielsen.
Market share data from the three additional countries - Portugal, Switzerland and Austria - has been included for the first time, making the 2006 yearbook the most comprehensive ever.
The data contained in the yearbook - soon to be published - clearly shows that there were considerable private label market share gains across Europe last year, said Freeman.
Pieter Peerlings, a leading analyst at Deloitte, spoke on the topic "Retailing in Europe: opportunities and challenges".
He described changes in the retail business and discussed the significance of private label brands and flexible supply chains in achieving success.
The final talk focused on Russia - a market which may well possess the biggest potential for private label.
Alexey Filatov, MD of BBPG, spoke on the subject "Market profile: retailing and private label in Russia".
He examined the current situation in Russia, a country characterised by rapid change, and described what this meant for private label growth there.
Great demand for private label in Russia forecast Total retail sales in Russia stand at ¤300bn, with ¤130 bn of that sum accounted for by food.
The Russian market was growing at a double digit rate every year, said Filatov.
In urban centres large scale C&C's and hypermarkets were booming; market leaders were now aiming to expand into regional areas.
The private label sector could benefit from this rapid growth, said Filatov.
Private label sales were currently worth ¤2.3 billion according to Filatov.
An actual ACNielsen report that private label accounts for less than 1% of overall sales and 4% of sales at the 28 leading retail chains in Russia.
Alexey Filatov expects private label market share to total between 30% and 40% within three years.
In support of his prognosis Filatov quoted several retailing executives from leading chains that are in favour of private label and have already announced plans for their own projects.
Prices of raw materials soaring Harvest losses and strong demand raise raw material prices The food industry suffers from clear price increases for agricultural raw materials like pork, fruits, vegetables and potatoes.
The reasons are harvest losses after the heat wave and the high demand during the BBQ season and throughout the Soccer World Cup.
Besides, producers are also facing high energy costs.
The seven-week heat wave in Germany and the increased demand due to the Soccer World Cup and the BBQ season have lead to shortages and often significant price increases for agricultural raw materials.
Consequently, the German Food Industry Association (BVE) expects a marked price increase for food products.
However, due to the strong competition, the German Food Retail Association does not see much space to raise prices.
The food industry cannot compensate the cost increases through cuts in other sectors, explains BVE.
Increased energy prices are another burden for the industry which will be forced to raise its sales prices for the food retail trade.
Prices for slaughter pigs have increased by more than 20 percent during the last months, prices for certain fruit varieties rose by up to 90 percent.
A meagre potato harvest with losses of up to 30 percent and low quality will lead to rising potato prices.
In many sectors of the food processing industry, prices for raw materials account for the largest share of the production costs, explains BVE.
Company's yields are thus very sensitive to increasing prices for raw materials.
Clear Increase Prices for agricultural raw materials in Germany (in €, estimated)
The best of the last five years Germany's 100 biggest restaurant chains/companies rang up an additional 4.6% in sales revenues in 2005 (2004: +3.9%; 2003: +0.4%; 2002: -0.9%).
Out of the doldrums at last!
With growth of over 5% in some-store sales, market-leader McDonald's posted above-average results.
Two estimated, triple-digit cases of growth - Resto-Lutz and Do & Co: both come from Austria and both are newcomers to the ranking (52nd and 67th place).
And the outlook for 2006?
Undiluted optimism.
Altogether, the top 100 generated revenues of EUR 8 billion with over 15,500 outlets.
2005 was noticeably better than the year before.
In many cases, companies reported not only having met their revenue targets but also having exceeded them.
Growth really set in during the second half of the year.
It seems we have definitely left the Valley of Tears - 2002 and 2003 were the worst years since the end of the eighties.
The mood in the sector has not been so good for a long time.
This year, 86% of companies polled expect to increase their revenues over the previous twelve months.
A few headlines to start with:
• Hardly any shifts among the top 10 or, come to that, among the top 20.
Ikea has moved up to 9th place (double-digit growth rates 13 times over the last 15 years).
Since 1995, the revenues of the top 10 have risen by a total of 31%.
• 4.6% more revenues for the top 100.
Thus, there were, once again, more structural changes per brand, per system and per size - per multiplied formula for success.
Mark you, Germany still has very many small businesses.
• In terms of revenues, fast food accounts for almost 50% of the apex of the market.
When it comes to growth in the individual segments, leisure leads with 8.9% (2004: +9.5%).
At the other end of the scale comes travel with +2.6% (2004: +2.1%).
For the second time running, not one of the five segments ended the year with a minus.
• 13% of the top 100 companies regard themselves as global players.
And they generate 52% of the to-100 revenues - mainly in the fast food and travel segments (2004: 12%/51%).
At the other extreme, 16% operate solely in a single city.
They account for 3% of the top-100 revenues.
Between the two poles comes a broad spectrum of companies active on a regional to multinational basis.
• The leaders in terms of revenues in 2005 were McDonald's with +EUR 119.3 million, Burger King with +EUR33.8 million and Subway with +EUR 28.0 million.
In relative terms, the rating looks as follows:
Do & Co and RestoLutz each with +100% followed by Subway with +62.2%.
Starbucks (+39.8%), for the first time without ex-joint venture partner Karstadt, now has a special place of its own in this hit list.
• Business in the event catering, 'eatertainment', fresh fast food and takeaway segments were better than average.
And it was business with caffè latte & co. that provided the most insights for dealing with structural change in the sector.
Here, it is lifestyle that sells.
• Anniversaries in 2005: 75th anniversary of Käfer, Munich (delicatessen, party service, restaurants), 50th anniversary of Wienerwald (Germany's oldest restaurant brand/chicken), 40th anniversary of Nordsee Fisch Fast Food (formerly part of the Unilever Group) and the 30th anniversary of Europa-Park Rust (Germany's No. 1 fund park with more than 4 million visitors per year).
• Profitability: up again.
50% describe their profits as being good.
Two years ago, only 28% could say this.
Moreover 12% report very good profits and only 3% a bad profit situation.
For 2006, 85% anticipate improved revenues (50% more guests, 57% higher average bills - 77% bigger profits).
• Same-store sales/like for like: positive in more than half of all top 100 companies.
Outstanding in the case of Ikea with +14.5%, Joey's Pizza with +14.4%, Café Del Sol with +13.4%, Hallo Pizza with +10.8% and Le CroBag with +8.5%.
Big, double-digit declines for all multiplex cinemas (not enough good films).
An analysis of the five market segments:
Fast-food/QSR is the biggest sector: 30 names, 23 of them with increases.
The bulk of the new outlets were opened by Subway (+125), Burger King (+50) and Tchibo Coffeebars (+50).
Market leader McDonald's returned the best figures since 2000.
But with no new openings.
Just 50-plus McCafé installations within the framework of outlet remodelling.
100 McCafés are to be added this year.
Germany is the test market for Europe.
Subway once again took a big step forward and now, after six years in Germany, can boast almost 300 outlets.
Pizza delivery: 3 out of 6 names reported above-average increases.
Travel: 18 names and only 2 of them in the red.
Nevertheless, the overall result was below average.
Railway stations and airports have undergone a rapid decoding process over the last ten years.
No longer are they simply places of arrival or departure.
What counts nowadays is shopping and, of course, eating and drinking.
Important in this connection is the right mix of concepts.
To upgrade a much-used facility at the same time as exploiting it to the full calls for the great expertise and sensitivity.
Fullservice: 21 companies, around half of them based in Munich.
Together, the highest growth rate of the last ten years - despite 2.9% fewer restaurants.
Good business, especially in niche markets.
Retail: 8 companies, mainly flat.
Only Ikea and XXXLutz/RestoLutz (both furniture store empires) with outstanding growth/buying sales.
Leisure: the smallest group with 23 names and a top 100 market share of 7.2% reports the most growth with 8.9% and 3.5% more outlets.
An exciting newcomer: the Arena One catering company in brand new Allianz Arena in Munich, a shrine to football and a tourist magnet.
To summarise: a good start to the second half of the decade.
The most important challenge facing many companies: how to keep older concepts fit.
After all, it is worth taking great care of good brands.
Parallel to this, the emergence of a remarkable number of new and fresh concepts.

World Champion Host Although the Germans missed winning the World Cup, they were virtually unbeatable when it came to the services offered and performed in the host country.
During the four weeks of the Soccer World Cup 2006, some 3 million guests in the public areas of the 12 stadiums, around 350,000 VIPs in the hospitality areas and a total of 2 million foreign football fans gained a great impression of German hospitality.
With a staff of 4,000 in ten stadiums, Aramark, the Master Concessionaire for the public areas, catered for some 2.7 million guests while the 400 employees of Eurest Sports & Food (Compass Group) looked after another 300,000 in Stuttgart and Cologne.
The top products at all matches: grilled sausages and, of course, beer.
30:70, the average bill per stadium visitor came to between €6 and 7, which was significantly more than estimated beforehand.
In comparison, stadium caterers ring up an average bill of €3-4.50 during German first-division matches.
Thanks to the ebullient mood and the super weather, the fans tended to stay for a much longer time in the stadiums: frequently for as long as six hours, which meant lots of time for them to get hungry and thirsty.
There was also a relaxed party atmosphere in the VIP areas and tent villages around the stadiums where caterers Käfer, Haberl, Stockheim, Kofler and Lenôtre pampered a total of 350,000 VIPs.
And, although the standard could not have been higher, it was the simple things that proved the most popular.
Regardless of fan nationality, the curry sausage turned out to be one of the international favourites.
The unexpected winner of the World Cup: the fan festivals with public viewing, which were offered for the first time and attracted thousands and thousands of people in numerous cities.
According to Germany's ZDF television station, up to 16 million people watched the top matches on public screens.
And this had a direct impact on the hospitality sector.
In many cases, both restaurateurs and hoteliers were disappointed with their World Cup results - something that was not unrelated to the exceptionally good weather.
The main factors were leading to additional income in the hospitality field: a city-centre location convenient for the matches or the public-viewing areas, live broadcasts of the matches on the biggest possible screen and lots of outdoor capacity.
The losers: classic restaurants, especially up-market concepts.
Although not everyone in the hospitality business benefited from the World Cup, most people agree that it has given Germany an enormous boost as an international tourist destination - something that will benefit the sector as a whole in the medium term.

The top 45 found new impetus for growth primarily in new markets (up by 38.4%) and in school meals (up by 34.8%).
It is worth noting that the entire business of contract caterers is divided up as follows: 50.2% B&I, 24.5% hospitals, 13.8% old people's homes, 4.4% schools and 7.1% new markets (arena catering etc.). Germany:

Manufacturers are annoyed about politics Food industry against increasing regulations in Berlin and Brussels - World Cup stimulates the business 2006 Germany.
The German food industry complains about a growing number of legal control attempts regarding available foods.
The industry sector is especially hard on the European consumer politics.
"It should not be allowed that the EU commission can interfere massively in the product composition and that they want to regulate the offer," says Jürgen Abraham, chairman of the Bundesvereinigung der Deutschen Ernährungsindustrie (BVE) (Federal Association of the German Food industry) in Berlin.
The industry sector especially registers tendencies in Brussels from just subtle to outright blunt to influence the composition of the foods on offer and the marketing.
This political approach assumes that grave social problems and aberrations can be corrected by law.
As example Abraham names the issue of the increasing obesity of children and teenagers.
The internationally discussed approaches to a solution include changes in the composition of food products as well as an increase in taxes, marketing bans in schools or even a limitation on advertising.
"It is alarming that the EU commission unmistakably asks the European food industry to do something about the "finding new formulas" for their products, meaning that they should use less salt and sugar and offer low fat foods", says the BVE general manager Prof. Dr. Matthias Horst alarmed.
It is naive It is naive to believe that the composition of foods can be ordered independently from the acceptance of the customers regarding the taste of the products.
In the fight against the social problem of obesity all facets have to be included that form the live style of the individual and his socio-economic environment.
"Only this approach promises success," is the conviction of the BVE manager and he refers to the engagement of the industry sector on the platform Food and exercise (peb).
The association sees further troubles ahead in the area of the EU alcohol politics that is currently planned in Brussels.
The proposed measures match the usual pattern.
Advertising bans, prohibitive taxes and especially the increase and standardisation of the age limits for alcoholic beverages.
None of the existing measures have proved their effectiveness, says the BVE.
Against the background of the necessary decrease of red tape that is loudly publicized from Brussels as well as from Berlin, the food industry demands more caution from the legislator as well as an increased sense of proportion.
Abraham is also questioning the necessity of the planned consumer information law.
For the industry sector it is now important - as it is now a politically arranged matter - that the operational concerns meet practical and adequate consideration.
Increase According to the BVE, the World Cup, high summer temperatures and last but not least the increase in business activity stimulate the anticipated sales volumes of the industry sector.
We are moving with the trend, says Abraham in allusion to the current boom.
In the first three months of the year the national sales of the food industry increased by 2.9 per cent.
The total sales volume even increased by 4.2 per cent to 34.7 billion Euros.
With this the positive trend of 2005 continues.
In 2005 the industry was able to increase the sales volume by 2.9 per cent to 133.6 billion Euros.
The export had again a significant influence on the good result.
For 2006 the BVE reckons again with an overall sales increase of maximum three per cent.
Sorrowful, the companies are looking towards the for 2007 planned increase of the value added tax and the consequences for the consumption of the private sector.
"I think that the increase in value added tax will at the same time also be a program to increase illicit employment", says the BVE manager fundamentally doubting the measure.
Even if foods will probably be exempt from that as far as possible, around 25 billion Euro spending capacity will be taken away from the consumers.
Also, the skyrocketing energy costs create problems in the companies given declining margins.
In an EU-comparison, German businesses have to pay the second highest electricity costs, states the BVE.
That means that the industry sector faces severe competitive disadvantages in the global competition.
"We will plead for more competition in the electricity sector," says Abraham commenting on the rising concentration in that sector.
The politics of the big coalition are meanwhile triggering increasing scepticism in the industry sector that is mostly made up of medium-sized companies.
In this context the draft of the equal treatment act is symptomatic as it will again be put on top of the guidelines from Brussels - in spite of different sounding statements by the chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU).

Purchasing Managers are currently most concerned about next year's VAT increase.
These are the results of a study called "Image im Handel 2006" (Trade image 2006) by GfK Panel Services Deutschland (Consumer Research Institute).
Most buyers of the German food retail trade have an optimistic view into the future: 61 percent of the decision makers expect that the industry's economic development will be better than in 2005.
According to GfK, every third interviewee thinks that their business will perform like in 2005.
Only 6 percent anticipate a decline compared to last year.
However, the most important question for Purchasing Managers is the increase of the value-added tax as of January 1st, 2007.
Though the tax rate for food products will remain at 7 percent, 37 percent of them consider this subject to be important for the food retail trade.
Every fifth decision maker is actively involved in the price calculation and marketing process, reveals the study, whereas the question of profit is of importance to every sixth central buyer.
When conducting the study in spring 2006, the only other subject with similar importance was the marketing of the Soccer World Championship.

NEW ENERGIES - BIODIESEL Biodiesel - The fuel of the future Why new energies are so important Some 13 billion litres of crude oil and 14.7 billion kg of hard and brown coal are used worldwide every day, of which the majority is used to produce electricity and heat and to run airplanes, cars and trucks.
About 25 billion tons of carbon dioxide evaporates into the atmosphere when burning fossil fuels - with drastic consequences for the environment and climate.
This alone justifies the use of alternative energy sources.
The most important reason, however, is the limited supply of crude oil and the dependence on producers and possibilities of supply.
The last years have shown that the development of new energy sources have to be pushed vigorously.
Europe is lagging far behind.
In Brazil, drivers have been using ethanol for years.
Biodiesel is environmentally friendly and costs only half of the regular gas.
Besides, almost two thirds of the newly registered cars have a combined engine where you can choose to go on gas or ethanol.
This neither affects the engine power nor the life span, but pollutant emission is far less.
There is no comparable flexibility among German consumers or the industry.
Large gas companies have already discovered the growing market, but they are not (yet) pushing forward.
Above all, the infrastructure (gas stations) is only reluctantly expanding.
So far, biofuels only cover 3.4 percent of the gas demand in Germany.
Meanwhile, prices for raw materials to be used for the production of biodiesel are rising steadily.
Corn prices have increased by 25 percent since the beginning of the year.
The annual consumption is to be doubled by 2012.
This law triggered a flood of money.
Small investors, investment funds and venture capitalists pump billions into logistics and production.
Besides, billions of agricultural subsidies might become superfluous.
Farmers could produce sensibly and would not have any difficulties diversifying.
Fuels can also be produced from grass, hay or corn stalk.
Rheinische Post of August 19, 2006
Südzucker counts on biodiesel Aiming for market leadership in Europe - high investment goals Europe's largest sugar producer, Südzucker, plans to extend the segment of bioethanol for fuels and aims to be market leader in Europe.
Südzucker AG in Mannheim/Ochsenfurt, whose subsidiary "Südzucker Bioethanol GmbH" already runs the largest bioethanol plant in Europe, intends a significant expansion of this segment.
They produce 260,000 cubic metres of bioethanol with 700,000 tons of wheat every year.
An additional 100,000 cubic metres of bioethanol are to be produced in the future.
According to Südzucker, bioethanol will be marketed under the name 'Crop Energies' to be added into petrol.
According to EU regulations, the percentage of bioethanol to be added must increase from currently 2 to 5.75 percent by 2010.
By then, the Crop Energies brand is expected to achieve a market potential of €4 billion annually.
The subsidiaries in Belgium, France, Austria and Hungary will also be enlarged.
In Belgium, Südzucker is constructing a bioethanol production plant on the basis of wheat and sugar beets with an annual capacity of 300,000 cubic metres.
The French Ryssen Group, a subsidiary of Saint Louis Sucre (which also belongs to Südzucker) will extend the annual capacity of its current plant for dehydration and rectification of raw alcohol from currently 30,000 to 100,000 cubic metres.
To be able to further expand the bioethanol business, Dr. Theo Spettmann, Spokesman of the Managing Board of Südzucker, considers going public with the company's bioethanol branch.

ORGANIC MARKET Dynamic growth for organic foods The German organic market will be Europe's largest organic market, reveals the latest study of IRI.
A good 28 percent of all organic products sold in Europe are sold in Germany.
According to the IRI study conducted at the POS in May 2006, main motives for buying organic food were the ongoing food scandals and the overall refusal of genetically modified foods.
ACNielsen calculated a 10-percent increase for the food retail trade in 2005.
Dairy products, juices and vegetable spreads show over-proportional growth rates.
The market share of organic milk expands from 3 percent at the beginning of the year to almost 5 percent towards the end of the year.
For the first quarter 2006, ZMP (Center for Market and Price Reporting) calculated a sales increase of 32 percent for milk.
The reason for this new virtuous circle is the market entry of the discounters.
The forerunner Plus is now followed by Aldi, Lidl & Co.

€ 0.24 billion Producers (farmers incl. weekly markets and producers' delivery services) € 0.54 billion Others (drugstores, gas stations, kiosks, mail order houses) € 0.29 billion Food Retail Trade (incl. specialty shops) € 1.6 billion Source:
German organic industry turns over EUR 3.9 billion in 2005 Increasing competition led to bigger changes in the organic industry is the conclusion drawn by Professor Ulrich Hamm of Kassel University.
Better availability of organic products in organic supermarkets, conventional food retail outlets and discounters is putting pressure on the direct marketing farmers and forcing them out of business, unless they specialize or can offer a broad range of produce, says the ZMP Organic Market Forum reporting on current industry figures.
Whereas the conventional retail food trade increased its market share from 37 % to 41 %, the producers had to give up 2 % and now hold 14 %.
The health stores declined just as much and their share fell to only 6 % due to real turnover drops.
Despite turnover growth in absolute figures, the market share of the organic retail food trade dropped slightly from 26 to 25 %, according to Hamm's surveys.
Organic butchers and bakers also registered 1 % less turnover.
The winners besides the conventional retail food trade were the drugstores, box schemes and processing companies, which grew from 8 to 9 %.
The discounters are not shown separately in this study.
The turnover of all marketing channels together was estimated at 3.9 billion EUR, which is 11 % up on the previous year.

Trade with organic foods in Germany Last year, the German food retail trade realized a 10%-increase in turnover with organic products, reported the market research institute AC Nielsen.
The reason for this development was a growing awareness of health and healthy nutrition among consumers, found the market researchers.
The milk products, fruit juices and vegetable spreads segments recorded over-proportional growth rates.
Many consumers of conventional foods argue that the high price of organic products is the main reason why they prefer conventional articles.
Turnover of the German organic food retail trade rose by 5,5 % in the first half of 2006, according to business and organization consultant Hartmann.

Organic meat - prices on the rise Prices for organic slaughter pigs increased significantly in the first quarter of 2006:
Prices for animals grade E rose by 7 percent on average compared to the fourth quarter in 2005.
This means that organic farmers, who submitted their figures to ZMP (Center for Market and Price Reporting), realized a price of € 2.41 per kg slaughter meat when selling their product to producer cooperatives or processors.
The increase was not entirely surprising, as prices had already been re-negotiated in long-term contracts last year, when the limited supply had pushed customers' payment reserves.
Slight price increases are again expected for the second quarter of 2006.
Organic cattle also registered price increases in the first quarter of this year:
Throughout all quality grades, organic farmers realized 3 Cent more on average when selling growing bulls to producer cooperatives or processors.
Therefore, prices were at € 3.39 per kg slaughter weight, due to a growing demand for organic beef and price increases for conventional beef.
In contrast to pig prices, cattle prices orientate stronger by the official price quotations for conventional animals, since surcharges are more common, and the market more easily adapts to price increases.

"Even if the price is increasing, price is not really preventing the consumer from buying fish," BFF Secretary Matthias Keller told IntraFish.
In value terms, German household seafood consumption rose by 8 percent to €1.185 billion ($1.5 billion) this first half-year.
The figure equates to 188,000 tons, a 2 percent increase over the same period.
The figures do not include seafood sales in the German food service market, which account for at least 40 percent of sales, Keller said.
The decision by hard discount chains such as Lidl to sell fresh fish from October last year, may have contributed to a 9.6 percent increase in sales by value and a 4.3 percent increase in volumes, Keller said.
From January to June, households bought 24,334 tons of fresh fish worth €347 million ($443.1 million), while the average price of fresh fish rose 5.1 percent to €10.18 ($13).
The value of frozen sales also climbed by 10.2 percent in the first half of the year to €347 million ($445.4 million).
Households also increased their volume purchases by 4.9 percent to 64,000 tons, BFF said.

Power outage at fish market in Hamburg - 1,000 lobsters choked A power outage of six hours caused heavy losses for fish dealers at the fish market on 'Grosse Elbstrasse' in Hamburg.
All companies on the fish market in Hamburg-Altona were affected by the outage on July 18th from 11:45 am till 5:44 pm with an outside temperature of more than 30°C, thus being part of the group of 621 households and 422 companies without electricity.
Dealers of fresh fish like 'Hummer Pedersen' suffered the most: approx.
1,000 lobsters choked in his basins, reports owner Joachim Niehusen.
Although the lobster meat could be chilled and parts of the live animals were cooked, he estimates his loss at about EUR 30,000.00, which he is claiming back from Hamburg power supplier 'Vattenfall'.
According to Peter Timmann, employee with fresh fish dealer 'Möller & Reichenbach', the company had to destroy all of their weekly delivery right on that day.
"The water was just too warm".
Alexander Schumann, CEO of 'Frische Paradies', had to close his company temporarily.
Fish in trend - the favourite: salmon The per-capita consumption of fish and fish products in Germany increased from 13.8 kg in 2004 to 14.8 kg last year.
The highest growth was realized in the smoked fish segment, where sales increased by 8.5%.
Salmon still remains very popular among German fish consumers.
In the salmon market, with 31,909 tons the largest fish segment, salmon accounts for the largest share with 41.2% or 13,204 tons.
The trade has adapted accordingly.
In the fine fish segment, full-range food retailers try to extend their offer towards discount by pushing their private labels.
On the other hand, discounters increasingly count on brand names.
According to Gottfried Friedrichs KG, the discount concept of full-range food retailers will fail in the long run.
Consumers associate a certain value and image with brand products.
Both values will gradually fade the more a brand product is sold too cheap.
Though 61.8% of the smoked salmon is currently purchased at discounters, the segment is stagnating there, unlike in other distribution channels.
According to GfK ConsumerScan, self-service department stores registered an increase of 42.5 % with smoked salmon in 2004 in terms of value.
The traditional food retail trade realizes 10%, consumer markets 12.9%, and even specialty fish dealers with an increase of 7.1% were ahead of discounters with a growth of only 6.3 in this segment.
The market leader for smoked salmon did well to concentrate on premium products.
Therefore, the sales of brand products again registered double-digit growth rates in December 2005 (high season:
Christmas), and developed exceptionally well in the first half of 2006, reported Gottfried Friedrichs KG.
However, the company does not take any risks with raw products or processing quality.
As a raw product for their trout filets they only use fresh trout from carefully chosen and regularly controlled fish breeders in Denmark or Poland.
With Alaska Pollack, the MSC certificate guarantees sustainable fishing.
Fish swimming on the wave of success at Intercool, Sept 24-27, 2006 in Düsseldorf Per capita consumption continues to rise - salmon in trend - wellness out of the ocean Compared to last year, the per capita consumption of fish and fish products in Germany increased once more to an average of 14.5 kg (2004: 13.8 kg).
In other words: 'fish is on everyone's lips', be it in the catering industry, in the trade or among consumers.
Therefore, fish will be a very important subject at the trade fair in Düsseldorf.
Almost 70 exhibitors will be showing fish and fish products.
According to the Centre for Fish Information (Fisch-Informationszentrum e.
But more exclusive varieties like pangasius or tilapia have also gained in popularity, just like pollack, which the German fish industry had been declared 'trend fish' (plus 42% in 2005).
On the listing of the most popular fish varieties, saithe moved up from 8th to 6th place.
"By means of various events, we managed to create public interest in pollack, a fish which is very popular but often underestimated", resumes Dr. Matthias Keller, General Manager of FIZ.
Nutritionists recommend eating fish every day, if possible.
Besides the low fat content, fish is a rather light meal with so-called Omega-3 fat acids, which slow down the process of skin aging - a hot topic in the cosmetic industry.
Consumers perceive fish as a high quality product which enhances fitness and health, and is thus consumed more often than in the past, also due to the frequent meat scandals.
Consumer trends in this sector are very interesting:
Frozen food (33 % of the total fish consumption) and fish products such as marinades and canned products are bought more frequently.
Fine food salads with fish, crustaceans or molluscs are a highlight for special occasions, and are thus bought less frequently, but also at slightly higher prices.
Surveys reveal that fish consumers consider the price to be secondary; freshness, quality, hygiene and taste are more important.
Fish is bought at the end of their shopping tour and is processed at home as soon as possible - fish is hardly ever bought ahead.
No wonder that the specialty trade and delicatessen stores are the market leaders in this segment.
They are not simply weighing the salmon or halibut, it's about advice, personal contact and decorative product presentation - following the example of our French neighbours.
Shopping adventure and product placement are key.
This concept can only be successful with the right mix of convenience, including frozen food, and conventional products.
Market researchers have learned that customers appreciate a clear product presentation, variety, even whole fish in the display and communication.
There is no other fresh food counter where customers talk as long and intensively - recipes and tips for preparation are part of the daily sales routine.
Some years ago, the company located in Bremerhaven decided to ban any additives such as taste enhancers, preservatives etc. from their frozen food and fish meal products.
At first, consumers did not appreciate this initiative, which has changed drastically since 2004.
The motto of their fish cuisine: innovative products will make life easier for the HRI industry, e.g. for banquets.
Lebensmittel Zeitung No. 37, September 15, 2006
Fish industry full of confidence Turnover increasing - sales almost unchanged - exports recovering -raw material prices rising strongly Due to rising raw material prices, German fish processors benefit from strong increases in turnover.
However, in the first months of 2006, sales were only slightly above last year's level.
In 2005, volumes had actually been declining.
Exports increased for the first time in the last three years.
Matthias Keller, General Manager of the Federal Association for the German Fish Industry and Fish Wholesale Trade, does not want to overvalue the sometimes double-digit growth rates in turnover realized in the first months of 2006.
He admits that this increase is hardly driven by larger volumes but mostly due to significantly higher raw material prices.
While in the first quarter of 2006, the turnover of fish and fish products realized an increase (in value terms) of 6.6 percent up to EUR 426.3 million, production rose by only 1 percent.
"This is an important sign", observes Keller, which means that consumers are not put off by high prices.
That's why the fish industry and fish wholesalers are optimistic.
In the current discussion about lifestyle and healthy nutrition, fish and seafood products are very important.
One proof is the growing per capita consumption of fish and seafood products, which reached 14.8 kg in 2005 (according to preliminary figures).
The Federal Association calculated a per capita consumption of 14.2 kg for 2004, whereas the Federal Statistics Office counted only 13.8 kg for the same year.
Keller is not concerned about globalization in the fish industry.
He feels that the German fish production is competitive.
The continuous increase in turnover per company only proves this.
While more and more raw material is processed in the country of origin, the know-how cannot so easily be transferred abroad.
Besides, consumers' demand for fresh processed products is increasing which in turn calls for domestic production.
The product ranges are already expanding due to innovative fish and seafood products.
One example is a mixed box with small portions of different smoked fish varieties or new salads with prawns and crayfish.
All in all, the German fish industry (here: companies with more than 10 employees) produced a total of 469,903 tons of fish products, i.e. 0.9 percent less than in 2004.
Like in 2004, the most important product group in terms of value were breaded fish filets and herring products.
Frozen fish filets now rank third; they ousted smoked salmon from third to the fourth place.
Smoked salmon had to take severe losses with a decline in volume of 22 percent and a drop of 19 percent in value terms.
The main reason for this development is the shift of production to Poland, comments Keller.
Highest growth rates in terms of volume and value were realized with seafood products, fresh fish filets, smoked herring and frozen crustaceans.
The total turnover of the 87 companies reporting to the Federal Association increased by 7.8 percent to some EUR 1.86 billion.
The lion's share of EUR 1.5 billion was realized in Germany.
Moreover, exports increased for the first time in three years, accounting for an over proportional growth of 15.7 percent to EUR 338 million.
Consequently, the export ratio rose from 16.9 to 18.1 percent.
The Federal Association observes strong competition both on sales and on buying markets, which leads to higher costs for purchasing, processing and distribution.
Ninety percent of the raw frozen fish filets had to be imported from third countries, as the European fishing industry was unable to supply enough raw materials.
Special fish varieties like Alaska Pollock, hake and hoki fish could not be supplied at all.
Only very small amounts of the raw herring required by the German herring processors are supplied domestically.
All in all, the self sufficiency rate of the German fish industry is at about 25 percent.

Aquaculture grows in importance as demand for fish increases To feed the world's increasing appetite for fish, food processors are going to have to turn to commercial aquaculture farms for their supplies, according to a Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) report.
A levelling off of the amount of fish caught in the wild, coupled with a growing world population and increasing per capita demand for fish, means a shortfall in supply, the FAO stated.
The shortfall will have to be made up by supplies of farmed fish.
However, aquaculture might not be able to deliver the goods.
Nearly half the fish currently consumed as food worldwide are raised on fish farms rather than caught in the wild, the FAO stated in the report.
About 45.5m tonnes of farmed fish, worth $63 billion, is eaten worldwide each year.
Meanwhile levels of captures of fish in the wild have remained roughly stable since the mid-1980s, hovering at around 90 to 93 million tonnes annually.
Of the wild fish caught about 60 million tonnes is destined for human consumption.
Since there is little chance of any significant increases in catches beyond these levels, companies are going to have to use more farmed fish to meet any supply shortfall, the FAO says.
The FAO's report estimates that an additional 40 million tonnes of aquatic food will be required by 2030 -- just to maintain current levels of consumption.
The FAO also found that the wild fish stocks are in poor condition to meet any further increase in demand.
Of the nearly 600 wild fish species the UN organisation monitors, 52 per cent are considered fully exploited while 25 percent are either overexploited, depleted or recovering from depletion.
Twenty per cent of the species are moderately exploited, with just three percent ranked as underexploited.
"Catches in the wild are still high, but they have levelled off, probably for good," stated Rohana Subasinghe of the FAO's fisheries department.
The only option for meeting future demand for fish, Subasinghe argues, is by farming them.
However, she finds that the aquaculture sector might not be able to expand sufficiently to meet that demand.
"Aquaculture could cover the gap between supply and demand, but there are also many forces which could pull production in the opposite direction, making it difficult for the industry to grow substantially enough to meet demand in the decades to come," she stated.
Aquaculture has been experiencing a boom since the mid-1980s, sustaining a growth rate of around eight per year, according to the FAO figures.
Today it continues to expand in almost all world regions, with the exception of sub-Saharan Africa.
The FAO is concerned that momentum could taper off if governments and development agencies don't adjust their policies to respond to emerging challenges that threaten to damper the sector's future growth.
One serious bottleneck, says FAO, is the lack of investment capital for producers in the developing world.
Another is a shortage of land and freshwater for use in aquaculture.
Rising energy costs also pose a problem, and environmental impacts and questions of product safety continue to require attention.
The Agency's report also points to doubts regarding future supplies of fishmeal and oil, used to feed carnivorous cultured species, such as salmon, grouper and sea bream.
Increased demand could also squeeze supplies of fishmeal and fish oil used for livestock feed.
The bulk of fishmeal is used for livestock feed, chiefly by the poultry sector.
Aquaculture now accounts for 35 percent of the world's fishmeal supply.
"So as aquaculture's fishmeal needs grow, competition with terrestrial livestock for a limited resource will intensify, with ramifications for both price and availability," the FAO stated.
"Key to resolving the dilemma will be continued progress in improving the efficiency of feed formulations -- reducing the amount of fishmeal they contain - and coming up with adequate vegetable-based additives."
The report calls for global and national policies to be put in place to cater for the growing appetite for fish.
"Markets, trade and consumption preferences strongly influence the growth of the sector, with clear demands for production of safe and quality products," the report stated.
"As a consequence, increasing emphasis is placed on enhanced enforcement of regulation and better governance of the sector."

MEAT INDUSTRY Food retail trade main distributor of meat products The food retail trade dominates the sales of meat in Germany.
In 2004, a total of some 6 million tons of meat and poultry (by selling weight) were sold on the German market.
Some 4.53 million tons, which corresponds to 75 percent, came from domestic slaughterhouses, the remaining 25 percent were imported.
2.8 tons of all meat was processed, of which 60,000 tons were sold directly by producers, another 1.1 million tons were exported.
The total of 2.1 million tons of unprocessed meat sold on the German market was mainly distributed through the German retail trade, accounting for a share of 64 percent.
One fifth was sold by the hotel and restaurant industry, 12 percent were sold via butchers.

Focus on deer New Zealand plans new promotion campaign for autumn 2006 The New Zealand deer industry plans to further extend its production and supply volumes in 2006.
For Germany alone, its traditionally largest export market, they expect an increase of more than 20%.
According to the industry association "Deer Industry New Zealand", Wellington, a total of 24,846 tons of deer meat worth NZD 198 million (EUR 96 million) was exported in the last business year, i.e. until March 2006.
Compared to 18,876 tons in the previous year, this corresponds to an increase of 33%.
For the current year 2006/07, the industry anticipates an export volume of 27,448 tons, of which 11,351 tons are destined for Germany - 20% more than in 2005/06.
The sales will be supported by a new, consumer oriented promotion campaign, which the Munich-based agency 'Modem Conclusa' (responsible for Germany) will introduce at the upcoming Intermeat fair.
This campaign will mainly use large banners near hyper- and supermarkets, supported by product samplings, recipe books and a redesigned internet presence.
Deer breeding has a long tradition in New Zealand.
With a total of 1.7 million animals spread among 4,000 breeders, New Zealand produces half of the amount farmed worldwide.
Due to controlled breeding methods, the product quality can be carefully determined.
The meat is mostly exported pre-cut and vacuum-packed, either fresh, chilled or frozen, in most cases by ship.
Other export markets are Belgium, Australia, Sweden, France and the US.
Business with bison Two years ago, the Saxon butcher 'Landhan GmbH' created the brand "Bisonders", which stands for high quality bison meat directly from Canadian breeders.
These products serve a growing market niche and correspond to the current trend of health conscious nutrition.
This is why well-informed customers accept the slightly higher product prices.
Specialty stores are currently facing the question of how to boost their product range with innovations when almost every possibility has already been exploited in the pork and beef segment.
On the 4th regional brunch in Großstolpen near Groitszsch, "palatine-ticklers" like bison broth, goulash soup or salad from bison whet the appetite for more.
Therefore, the team from Fleischerei Landhan GmbH prepared Canadian Prairie Meat, sour roasted bison with apple-raisin sauce and bison roulade "à la Saxon" as a main course.
Numerous gourmets within a radius of 50 km confirmed in a questionnaire that they had explicitly come to this culinary event in Western Saxony to taste and buy bison specialties.
In the past, Eckhard Landgraf was engaged in pig feeding with agricultural producer cooperative Landwirtschaftliche Produktionsgenossenschaft (LPG) in Großstolpen.
Together with Chef Dieter Kükelhan, who worked in the kitchen of LPG's cultural centre, he founded Fleischerei Landhan GmbH in 1991.
In very small premises, they started to produce specialties from home slaughtering with six employees.
The product line was completed with sausage products of other producers.
As the young businesses' premises soon got too small, they reconstructed the former dairy cow section of the cooperative and opened new facilities with high-tech equipment on 700 square metres in 1994.
In the summer 2001, daughter Dana Landgraf was appointed General Manager of the company which today counts 65 employees.
Three Master Butchers, twelve assistants and back staff are employed in the production process, and produce 2 to 2.5 tons of fine meat and sausage products every day, sold in 14 subsidiaries in Saxony and East Thuringia.
Fleischerei Landhan GmbH also supplies caterers and nursing homes.
They also run the kitchen in LPG's cultural centre.
The company also supplies three schools with more than 500 lunches during the week and sells 'meals on wheels'.
Imports over the Atlantic Four years ago, Eckhard Landgraf had his first contact with a bison breeder in Canada, who asked Fleischerei Landhan GmbH to process their meat so that they could promote the products themselves.
The product line was expanded due to the positive response at trade fairs and other events.
For two years now, Fleischerei Landhan GmbH has been importing Canadian bison meat for its own product line.
"At the International Green Week I got to know a breeder from Saxony", reports Eckhard Landgraf.
This developed into a firm business relationship and the brand "Bisonders" was created to promote the products in their own subsidiaries.
Canada has only two slaughterhouses which are approved for the export to Europe.
He orders an average of 250 kg of bison meat per week.
Since the Canadian partner has a subsidiary in Europe, the processor has to deal with much less paperwork.
Despite occasional currency fluctuations, prices have so far been stable, says Landgraf.
The prime cuts are sold frozen in the original packaging.
Shoulder, (chomp) and parts of the prime cuts are used for sausages.
The products range from bison salami to bison bockwurst to raw and hot smoked bacon.
Bison meat can also be used for hot dog style sausages (Bruehwurst) and 'Thuringian Rostbratwurst' (rib steak sausage).
Very popular is liver pâté with cream or pieces of bacon.
The latest innovation of the 'Bisonders' line is a cream liver pâté with lingonberries.
Good chances for niche products The average slaughter yield of a grown bison amounts to 50.8 percent.
Compared to meat of domestic cattle, bison parts are smaller and contain less fat.
That needs to be taken into account when processing:
Fleischerei Landhan GmbH adds a maximum of 20 percent of pork fat, following the motto "as little as possible, as much as necessary".
Bison specialties currently account for a share of three to five percent of their total production.
"It's still a niche, but we want to further expand it due to the huge potential", reveals Eckhard Landgraf.
Despite higher prices for bison products, there are already a number of steady customers in the neighbouring area who like to buy "Bisonders" meat and sausage products in one of the subsidiaries.
Caterers mostly buy prime cuts for preparation in their kitchens.
This is why he counts on a future cooperation with distribution partners - such as butchers, delicatessen stores or food retailers who want to keep their clients with culinary highlights and like to attract new customers.
One handicap are the relatively high costs for logistics of fresh products, concedes Landgraf.
That's why he has launched a canned product in a 100 gram glass jar - to be tried out with liver pâté - which can be stored up to one year and which might, when attractively presented in a store, arouse consumers' interest.
BEVERAGES China to start making ice wine China's biggest wine producer Changyu has set up an alliance with Canadian ice wine maker Aolos to build what is expected to be the largest ice wine estate in the world.
Canada is currently the largest producer of ice wine, a sweet dessert wine made from frozen grapes that was originally developed in Germany in the 1700's.
Grapes are left on the vine well into the winter months and then pressed in their cold state.
The water in the juice remains frozen as ice crystals, and only a few drops of sweet, concentrated juice is obtained, making the wine much more expensive than traditional red and white wines.
"Global annual production is only 1,000 tons which is much lower than demand.
It is this imbalance that attracts us to invest in this industry, which is entirely new to China," Changyu manager Zhou Hongjiang told AP-Foodtechnology.com. One of the leading producers, Aolos currently accounts for about 10 per cent of the global supply.
Zhou explained that the factory will be supplied by an ice vineyard, built five years ago, that covers 5000 acres.
It has been on trial for almost three years.
"As a result its production can reach 1000 tons when it comes on-stream.
I believe such a large-scaled output will insert great influence on the global market," he said.
China is one of few wine markets that are still expanding, with double-digit growth each year.
Changyu, based in Yantai, Shandong Province, dominates the country's wine market with a 21 per cent share and annual capacity of 80,000 tons.
Its products are exported to Malaysia, USA, Holland, Belgium, Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and elsewhere.
According to the OIV (Organisation Internationale de la Vigne et du Vin), China's grape planting scale is the eighth largest in the world and its annual wine production ranks eleventh.
Oktoberfest - Munich beer festival started The 173rd Oktoberfest Beer Festival has opened in the southern German city of Munich.
Hundreds of thousands of people turned up on Saturday for an opening ceremony at noon.
To the more than six million people who will visit the German city of Munich over the next month, it makes perfect sense.
Munich mayor, Christian Ude, began the festivities with a twelve-gun salute, a signal to everyone to start the beer flowing.
The world's biggest beer-drinking festival has long been a huge tourist draw, and some six million visitors from around the world are expected to fill the beer tents this year.
People waited for hours to get a seat for a sing-along with polka bands.
The Munich Beer Festival is set to run for 18 days.
Visitors at last year's 172nd Oktoberfest spent € 955 million ($1.2 billion) on accommodation, public transport, shopping and, above all, 6 million litres of beer, 481,000 chickens, 560,000 pork knuckles and 95 oxen, according to the organizers.

PET FOOD INDUSTRY Positive development in the pet food trade Industry records increases in the food retail trade - growth in the cat food segment The pet food trade got new impetus due to a positive development in the dry cat food segment.
Wet dog food, however, is not as successful.
For the first time in years, the food retail trade records positive results for pet food, following a series of increases in the pet food specialty trade.
Just like in 2005, this year's main winners are discounters, whose market shares increased significantly, as show recent figures from industry and market researchers.
Thus, the undisputed market leader in the pet food segment, Masterfoods GmbH of Verden, participated only to a very small extent in the positive development, as the company, unlike its competitors, does not offer any private label products.
In 2005, the industry realized a turnover of EUR 3.08 billion with pet food supplies (plus 2.3%).
Sales of pet food reached EUR 2.3 billion (plus 1.6%), accessories were up by 4.1% to EUR 791 million.
Dog food stagnated at EUR 948 million.
Dry pet food rose by 3.1 percent to EUR 369 million, wet food dipped by 3 percent to EUR 326 million, and snacks for dogs dropped slightly down to EUR 253 million.
Cat food, on the other hand, realized a growth of 3.2 percent to EUR 1.1 billion, which was mainly due to a rise of nearly 9% in the dry food segment, up to EUR 227 million.
Wet cat food, however, was far less successful and recorded a marginal growth of 1.5% up to EUR 765 million.
Snacks and cat milk realized a 5%-increase to EUR 111 million.
The remaining turnover was realized with feed for birds, fish and other pets.
These segments also did over-proportionally well.
AUSTRIA Organic food demand outstrips supply Austria seeks more organic food supply after a surge in demand has caused undersupply.
Even discount supermarkets are offering organic products because of high demand from Austrian consumers.
The largest association of organic farmers in the country, Bio Austria, said that despite more than 20,300 organic businesses in the country, not enough farmers produce 'bio' food.
Bio Austria believes home-grown organic pear production met only 10 per cent of demand.
Apple production satisfied just 40 per cent.
Only organic grains and cereals supply exceeded demand.
Organic producers constitute 11.5 per cent of all Austrian farmers and generate turnover of EUR 500 million a year.
Bio Austria aims to raise the number of organic farmers to 20 per cent by 2013.
Bio Austria chairman, Johannes Tomic, said the 'Green Pact' of the agricultural ministry helps attain this goal.
"The pact gives us planning security and ensures that the development of land for organic farming remains anchored in the country's environmental policies," Mr Tomic said.
He added that people's changing attitudes influenced the development of the domestic market.
"The organic sector has gone from being a niche market to a mainstream one, as more and more discount supermarkets opt for a bio section.
This is a very positive step."

Vienna - stronghold of tradition Simultaneously architectural, cultural and culinary bastion of tradition and modern metropolis, Austria's capital lies at the crossroads between Eastern and Western Europe.
It's hard to think of any other European city where so much of daily life and social interaction is devoted to eating and drinking.
Politics, in particular, has gastronomic ramifications in this regards.
Major elements of Viennese Cuisine originate from Countries, which were either friends or foes of the Danube monarchy.
This, combined with more recent influences, most importantly from Asia and Italy, has given birth to a unique gastronomic culture.
Today, Vienna is home to almost 9,000 restaurants, including any number of gastronomic showpieces.
Spar most popular in Austria 'Hofer' ranks second - one third of the consumers appreciate longer opening hours Spar, Hofer and Billa are the three most popular food retailers in Austria.
The most important criterion for consumers is a good price-performance ratio.
A consumer survey reveals that discounter 'Aldi-Sued' is their biggest competitor.
In the Austrian food retail trade, the two market leaders 'Rewe' Group - with its distribution channels Billa, Merkur and Penny - and 'Spar' Group (Spar, Interspar and Eurospar) are fighting hard for market shares and the favour of their customers.
'Hofer', a subsidiary of 'Aldi', is a major competitor, and leads together with Spar the list of 'favoured companies', ahead of Billa.
This was revealed by a study from 'Marketagent.com'. Customers most frequently go to Spar/Eurospar/Interspar, followed by Billa; Hofer ranks third.
Spar Group and Hofer, which both account for 25 percent, are the undisputed leaders of the list of 'favoured companies'.
The Rewe Group was represented with Billa (17.4%) and Merkur (12.9%), explained Thomas Schwabl, General Manager of Marketagent.com. With 79 percent of the votes, customers consider a favourable price-performance ratio to be 'very important', second to 'good accessibility'.
Only 30 percent of the customers regarded long opening hours, private labels, brand names and specials for regular customers to be important.
Expressed in school grades (1 = very good, 6 = inadequate), the Spar Group was rated 1.8, followed by discounter Hofer (2).
Most of the interviewed customers - almost 70 percent - said they would miss 'Hofer' most, Spar followed with 58 percent.
Food retailers which the customers would miss the least were Magnet, Contra and Norma.
The market research institute 'SMS-Research' conducted a study among 1,000 consumers in Austria which showed that almost 36 percent of them granted the highest growth chances to Hofer, followed by Spar/Interspar with 26.7 and Billa with 10.6 percent.

Every fifth interviewee sees himself as a fan of brand names.
These are the findings of a study conducted by the market research institute 'IHA-GfK'.
Swiss consumers do not let themselves be influenced by the current 'price hysteria'.
Quality as well as product qualities have a much stronger influence on the buying decision than promotion sales or the price of a product.
On a scale from one to ten, 'quality' and 'product qualities' were ranked most important for products out of six different product groups (soft drinks, chocolate, body shampoo, detergent, yogurt and coffee machines).
'Promotion sales' and 'product price' ranked third and fourth, observed IHA-GfK when interviewing 500 consumers in the German speaking- and Western Region.
If they have the choice between brands, promotion items and cheap offers, 30 percent claim to tend to brand products.
Besides product specific criteria such as quality, taste, packaging or price, so-called 'soft' criteria are regarded as brand benefits.
The consumption of brand products is linked to emotional factors such as well-being, trust, protection, safety or exclusivity.
More than two-thirds of the consumers choose their point-of-sale based on its accessibility.
Almost the same number (60 percent) chooses their POS based on the quality of the products sold there.
The latter underlines the high importance of brand names when buying articles of everyday use.
Further decision criteria are the offer of healthy and fresh products (55 percent), the product line (50 percent), the choice (46 percent), opening hours (39 percent) as well as friendly staff (35 percent).
Less than one third of the Swiss consumers considered the price to be important when choosing their point of sale.
Ninety-five percent of the interviewees say to have purchased goods of everyday use at Migros or Coop within the previous three months.
The importance of brands or private label products is different for each product group.
The share of consumers buying a brand-name body shampoo is very high - almost every second consumers says to prefer brand products.
The coffee machine market shows the same trend: some 40 percent of the Swiss consumers claim to buy brand products:
Nespresso is leading ahead of Jura and Saeco.
In the soft drinks and detergent segment, the percentage is at thirty-eight, 29 percent for consumers of chocolate.
Promarca is the Swiss association for brand producers in the consumer goods segment (food/near food).
The Association represents the interests of 83 member companies which generate total turnover of CHF 8.8 billion and employ a staff of 13,000 in Switzerland (www.promarca.ch). Source:
Swiss Exhibition (Messe Schweiz) promoting IGEHO Instead of launching Lefa (Trade fair for the food wholesale and retail trade), Swiss Exhibition will be expanding Igeho (the International Exhibition for Industrial and Institutional Catering, Hotels and Restaurants).
From now on, Igeho will be showcasing all segments of the out-of-home market.
Besides, other new segments of the food retail trade with potential of synergies for Igeho will also be integrated.
Parallel to the fair, the manufacturing industry will be offered a platform to present itself.
In the planning phase, the launch of Lefa as a pan-sectoral trade fair was well-received, but current contracts and projects do not allow a mutual realization of the event.
Therefore, Swiss Exhibition will no longer pursue the project 'Lefa'.
However, some parts of the former Lefa fair bear high potential of synergies for Igeho, the largest trade fair for institutional catering in Switzerland.
As a second step, Igeho wants to meet the needs of visitors of the retail trade (such as independent retailers, the food and drink specialty trade, wholesalers, discounters of specialty food stores).
In light of this expansion, Igeho aims at becoming the most important trade fair for the hotel and catering trade in Switzerland and neighbouring German-speaking countries.
Parallel to Igeho, some branches of the producing industry such as butchers will then find their own presentation platform.
Together with trade fair committees of Igeho and Lefa, Swiss Exhibitions is currently working on a detailed concept for the planned parallel events and the expansion of Igeho 2007.
Information on the event, its contents and themes will be available to exhibitors and interested parties at the end of August 2006. www.messe.ch Source:
A change in Switzerland's organic food market Increased competition has hit organic farmers in the Swiss food sector.
And there were 2.6 % fewer organic farms.
Still, the Swiss are the world's biggest buyers of organic products; each person spends SFR 160 annually.
The Swiss Research Institute of Organic Agriculture found out that farmers face a number of challenges.
The arrival of foreign discount supermarkets like the German Aldi and the French chain Carrefour could be key factors.
Organic farmers will no longer be able to charge higher prices unless it can be proved that organic products taste better and are more nutritional.
Consumers also need to be informed about the reasons for the higher prices.
Bio Suisse, the umbrella organisation for organic farmers, states in its annual report that Coop as the country's second largest supermarket chain is successful in marketing regional delicacies in shops close to where they are produced.
As the organisation believes, growth in the organic market will be fuelled and jobs will be ensured by this.
Coop played an important role bringing organic products to the consumers.
13 years ago, it was the first supermarket chain to stock organic groceries.
This led to a higher acceptance among consumers and these efforts have left Coop with a 50 % market share.
Migros stayed behind with a share of 24.7 %, reports the NZZ.
When starting to stock organic products, Coop's commitment was seen as a marketing strategy, but by now it has proved its seriousness.
1,400 food items bearing the Bio Suisse label are stocked, fresh produce is the most popular among those.
However, Otto Schmid from the Swiss Research Institute of Organic Agriculture warns organic farmers not to be too dependent on the big chains, since there is growing competition from non-organic products in general, including non-organic premium labels.
He refers to a Migros range which gives the false impression to be organic.
For the future, Coop is extending its range and improving its communication, since consumers demand tasty, ecologically produced food.
Mr. Schmid also states that a similar stagnation took place in Austria before the organic market revitalised itself.
The organic market in Switzerland needs changes Markus Arbenz became Director of Bio Suisse, the Swiss organic farmers' organisation, in June this year.
Being an agronomist and former organic farmer, he has recently returned from Swiss development projects in Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan.
As he stated in an interview with Swissinfo, the sector needs to take a new approach in order to reverse a decline in sales.
Last year, the number of organic farmers fell for the first time; turnover in organics was slightly down.
In his opinion, organic producers need to adapt to changed circumstances - quality should be more important than quantity.
Also, marketing should be improved.
Farmers in remote areas are especially worried; in the milk and meat sectors many farmers are unsure about their future.
Since markets are opening through the WTO and because of the relationship with the EU, farmers fear competition due to their high prices.
In order to support their members, Bio Suisse should market their products, explore new markets and new potential, including in the export sector.
Markus Arbenz states that ecology has a high priority in the Swiss Constitution, but at the level of legislation authorities do not implement the terms of the Constitution in an adequate manner.
There is a lot of pressure from lobby groups, saying that it is too expensive to support ecology.
But he also states that it is not the Government's duty to solve all of their problems.
The organisation would like to be able to develop, to export or to bring innovations to the markets without being burdened by bureaucracy or customs.
In comparison with other countries, production costs have fallen very fast due to structural reforms, reduction of costs for input supplies and more efficient marketing.
Bio Suisse should accept the further challenge of communicating the message of a healthier life and an environmentally sustainable approach in such a way that people understand that organic products are part of a healthier lifestyle.
Bio Suisse is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year.
On August 18th, a big party was held in Bern for farmers, producers, consumers and anyone interested.
The history of organic produce in Switzerland is the one of great success, according to Markus Arbenz.
When it comes to the consumption of organic products, Switzerland is still world leader.

Swiss ice cream consumption remains stable In 2005, Swiss consumption of ice cream remained at previous year's level.
Due to the rather cold weather, the results of the record year 2003 could not be reached.
According to the Swiss glace and ice cream manufacturers association, Swiss per capita ice consumption accounted for 7.3 litres, compared to 8.3 litres in 2003.
Of the total of 54.7 million litres in 2005, some 49.8 million litres were industrially produced ice cream and 4.9 million litres were soft ice and ice cream produced by HRI.
Trend towards less fat and sugar At the beginning of the summer season 2006, Swiss ice cream manufacturers launched highly promising innovations.
There is a clear trend towards diversification and varieties with less fat and sugar and therefore with less calories.
However, the taste should not fall by the wayside.
Migros undisputed No. 1 The ranking of Swiss food retailers shows that positions have hardly changed, despite the market entry of Aldi in 2005.
The market research institute IHA/GfK revealed that Migros remains the No. 1 with a turnover of CHF 15.7 billion (-0.6%), followed by Coop with CHF 13 billion (-0.8%) and the department store Manor with CHF 2.8 billion (+0.2%).
Not at last due to the takeover of Pick-Pay, Denner increased its turnover by 16% to reach CHF 2.1 billion.
Turnover of Aldi and Lidl is estimated at CHF 100-150 million.
The two German discounters could well account for CHF 1 billion by 2010.
Migros' subsidiary to stop turkey production Due to a lack of profitability, 'Micarna SA', the subsidiary of the Swiss retailer 'Migros', will cease to produce turkey as of mid 2007, and will concentrate their poultry production on breeding chicken.
This means that 35 jobs in the turkey slaughter and processing facilities are affected.
However, no jobs will be cut, since the employees will move to other departments within the company.
Coop Switzerland Coop Switzerland is the new partner of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).
This is the first partnership of this size in Switzerland, whose aim it is to promote organic products, improve product declaration and reduce environmental pollution.
Coop - a member of the WWF Wood Group and joined WWF Climate Group - has agreed to increase the share of wood and paper products with the FSC label and the share of fish with the MSC label.

Trade Fair News Three 'Inter' shows successful Duesseldorf trade fair organizers have given a positive summary of the trade fair trio "Intermopro", "Intercool" and "Intermeat".
The broad offer of 965 exhibitors, who presented their products from September 24 until 27, 2006, attracted 34,000 international visitors, 2,000 more than last time (2004: 31,900).
The share of foreign visitors increased as well.
All our important clients of the trade and catering industry have come to our stand."
The trade fairs for dairy products, frozen foods and meat and sausage products also benefited from Hogatec, the gastronomy trade fair which was held at the same time.
About 4,000 visitors of the hotel, gastronomy and catering trade took the chance to visit the 'Inter' shows for information on trends and innovations in the food industry. www.intermopro.de; www.intercool.de; www.intermeat.de Source:
Lebensmittelzeitung No. 40, October 6, 2006
From the first day, important decision makers attended the venue.
German visitors expressed a strong interest in all of the three trade fairs, whereas most international visitors were attracted by InterMeat - exhibitors report that many visitors came from Middle and Eastern Europe.
On the other hand, specialists from this area took the chance to present their services in distribution and logistics.
In the packaging sector, the ongoing trend is towards smaller package sizes.
Most of them are divisible and thus easy to split in individual portions.
Meat producers, for example, appreciate the benefits of plastic containers which often replace casings.
The overall trends which can be found in all of the sectors are Wellness, Convenience and - increasingly often - Functional Food.
Imagination knows no bounds, especially in the convenience sector.
Pre-cut cheese and bacon cubes, microwave steaks, and pasta which can be quickly cooked in a frying pan - more and more products meet the demand for quick and convenient cooking.
Light food, especially low-fat products, was present in all exhibition halls.
Most of them target women and children, also in light of the discussion about obesity among young adults.
While many producers from different sectors have added children's products to their ranges, the industry increasingly focuses on 'best agers', i.e. consumers older than 50 years.
They are well funded, pay attention to their nutrition and prefer smaller package sizes.
Products with additional health benefits are leading the list of product innovations, and not only for this target group.
Vion, for example, presented a new line under the motto "minus E".
These products do not contain any additives marked by an "E".
The ice cream manufacturer 'Roncadin' presented products for consumers with lactose intolerance.
In the future, there will likely be more producers who exploit this potential.
Lebensmittelzeitung No. 39, September 29, 2006
All signs look good for 37th ISM There is every indication that the next ISM confectionery fair in Cologne is once again going to be a high calibre event, booked to capacity.
Approximately 1,600 companies from almost 70 countries are expected to gather in Cologne for the 37th edition of the show scheduled to run January 28th - 31st 2007.
Among those present will be major market leaders and numerous small and medium sized enterprises.
Over 80% of the exhibitors will be from abroad, making the ISM the most significant, truly international forum for confectionery and snacks.
And, after the successful première in 2006, ProSweets - the confectionery industry supplier show - will be taking place for the second time, partly parallel to the ISM, from January 29th to February 1st, 2007.
For four days in Cologne the ISM will be showcasing a broad range of confectionery and snacks no other comparable event can match.
The ISM provides an almost exhaustive overview of the product groups chocolate, sugar confectionery, fine pastries, snacks, ice cream and raw pastes.
Articles on show are all retail products for end consumers.
Buyers from 155 countries At the 2006 ISM 35,249 buyers from 155 countries made use of the unique opportunity offered by the show to forge contacts, gather information and to order - just as they did in previous years.
Attendees and exhibitors from abroad accounted for 60% of ISM visitors.
The high calibre of visitors was remarkable - representatives of major retailers and retailing cooperatives or associations attended the Cologne show, making for very lively communication and heightening international flair.
The programme of events accompanying the ISM 2007 will feature a special exhibition on confectionery presentation.
Under the motto "Sweet impulses" 20 students and graduates of the Cologne International School of Design (KISD) will exhibit their ideas and innovative concepts for presenting confectionery.
Key words are impulse sales, point of sale, displays and promotional presentation.
The realisation of these ideas will emphasise the visionary and forward-looking quality of the concepts.
The results of the project, sponsored by Koelnmesse and headed by Professor Jenz Großhans, will be on show in Passage 4/5.
The ISM will occupy 110,000 m2 of floor space in Halls 2, 3, 4, 10 and 11.
In addition to the Entrances East and West, visitors can now also use the new Entrance South.
International confectionery supplier show ProSweets, which premièred successfully last year, will take place for the second time January 29th - February 1st 2007.
The show will present packaging, processing and packaging technology as well as ingredients of special relevance to the confectionery industry.
As in 2006, ProSweets 2007 will be located in Koelnmesse Hall 10.1.
Vegetable Market Potato processors complaining The first official estimate of the Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMVEL), Bonn, forecasts a potato crop of 9.83 million tons, a significantly lower crop which confirms the fears of the potato processing industry.
The crop volume is 17% short of the volume in 2006 and is not enough to meet the domestic demand, reports the Federal Association of the Fruit, Vegetable and Potato Processing Industry.
Moreover, the processing industry is highly worried about the quality of the European potato crop in 2006:
Potato prices soaring Growing concern about the quality of this year's late potato crop is driving the prices on new record highs almost every day.
Last week, prices for potatoes to be delivered in November 2006 increased by 9% to €20.50 per deciton.
Many packers already face about a high number of complaints due to late blight.
It is therefore not unlikely that good quality will be scarce in the second half of the business year.
Prices for potatoes in April 2007 reach already €23 per deciton, which means that storage until spring 2007 is calculated with €2.50.
Whether the crop volumes will be sufficient to meet the domestic demand still needs to be seen over the next weeks.
The Center for Market and Price Reporting forecasts a crop of 9.8 million tons, less than in 2006 (11.6 million tons) and even less than in the dry year of 2003.
This would be the lowest crop since 1994.
The reason is the extremely dry weather in July, and despite the heavy rain in August, the crops could not be saved.
Chilled Food Market Sales increases for chilled food Prepared high-quality food and meals out of the fridge - Chilled Food - is one of the hopeful segments in the food retail trade.
The Central Marketing Association of the German Agriculture (CMA) has been working hard to develop this segment further.
In meetings organized by CMA and BVE (Federation of German Food and Drink Industries), manufacturers and the trade have been working on practical suggestions with which to benefit from the potential in the chilled food segment.
The findings of these consultations have first been presented at the Chilled Food Congress in Cologne on September 11th and 12th, 2006.
All of the four working groups have come to the conclusion that current market conditions are ideal for chilled food.
The trade made it clear that chilled food would be among the strategic segments and would be expanded further.
Now it would be up to primary producers and manufacturers to exploit this potential and create high-quality products.
There has been a marked increase in consumption of convenience products in the first half of 2006.
The household panel of GfK (Consumer Research Institute) revealed that in the first six months of 2006, consumers spent a total of €1.28 billion for ready-to-cook meat dishes, fruit and fine food salads or fresh pasta, i.e. an increase of 8.5% or €100 million compared to the same period last year.
Sales in the chilled food sector have been increasing for years, and GfK anticipates further growth in the future. www.cma.de Source:
Snack Food Market Health and convenience drive snack growth Growth in the snacking industry is being driven by health concerns coupled with the need for convenience, according to new reports of both the fruit and hot snacks sectors.
The research, compiled by market analysts Leatherhead International, shows stagnating growth in the hot snack sector while sales in snacks such as whole dried fruit and fruit bars have increased on the back of a widespread trend towards healthier eating.
Major growth and innovation in the hot snacks industry does not appear to be on the cards with health issues becoming an important factor in sales that amounted to $6.76bn (€5.39bn) last year in Japan, the US, Australia and the five largest European countries of Germany, France, the UK, Spain and Italy.
At present, the relative solidarity of the market can be attributed to consumers prioritising convenience as microwave cooking becomes commonplace at home and in the workplace.
According to the report:
New product development in the sector has included incorporating additional health benefits and the introduction of 'drinkable' fruit products.

However, brands which were listed in the second half of 2005 or which had been listed prior to 2005 were not taken into account.
This way, hard discounters added 15 brand spirits to their product range, which generated a sales volume of 1.3 million bottles.
According to IRI, brand discounters added 10 brands to their product line and sold 1 million bottles in the first half of 2006.
This means that consumers spent more money for spirits.
The main reasons are price increases which most of the leading producers had announced in spring 2006.
The average sales price per bottle thus rose from €6.43 in June 2005 to €6.56 in June 2006, almost the same price as in 2002.
When looking at the importance of individual spirits varieties in the first half of 2006, vodka and rum are the segments with the highest growth rates (compared to the previous year).
Aldi), plus 6.4% to 23.35 million bottles.
When looking at discounters (incl.
Aldi), rum was the most successful segment with an increase of 13.1% to 7.83 million (total: 14.98 million bottles).
In the category of medium bitter liqueurs - dominated by the brands Jägermeister, Ramazzotti and Kuemmerling - market shares have changed in favour of the large brands and at the expense of regional products.
With a marginal growth of 0.1%, sales amounted to 28.47 million bottles.
IRI reports that medium bitter liqueurs represent the largest spirits segment with a total volume of 28.47 million bottles, including an increase of 201,000 bottles realized by the discounters - the food retail trade, however, remained at last year's level.
Whereas the food retail trade lost 2.8% in this segment, discounters realized an increase of 2.8%, but lost in the segments egg liqueur, fruit schnapps, bourbon whisky, cream liqueurs and vodka.
Organic / Health Food Market Organic supermarkets Organic supermarket chains Basic and Alnatura are expanding further.
Last week, Alnatura opened its 27th supermarket with a sales area of 520 sqm and 5,500 products in Göttingen; this was also the first subsidiary to be opened in Lower Saxony.
The Munich based Basic AG plans to open 21 markets by the end of the year.
After only seven new openings in 2006, expansion will be stronger in 2007.
European information system for organic markets recommended The European Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming addresses the need for better market data on organic farming.
Recommendations relating to the collection of such data have now been published by the EU-funded European Information System for Organic Markets (EISfOM) project.
"We found that the level of investment in statistics and market information does not reflect the size of this growing sector", says project coordinator Nicolas Lampkin from the University of Wales.
BioFach Newsletter No. 133, November 3, 2007
Organic in Europe Prof Ulrich Hamm introduces the EU wide organic trend At the second Cologne Organic Trade Forum, Prof Ulrich Hamm looked towards Europe.
With €3.9 billion, Germany is by far the largest national market within the European Union, followed by Great Britain with €2.2 billion and France with €1.7 billion.
In all of the three countries, organic foods realized double-digit growth rates in 2005.
However, the per capita consumption in Switzerland (€102), Denmark (€74) and Austria (€55) is higher than in Germany with only €47.
While the Danish and Austrian markets are currently expanding, the Swiss market is stagnating.
The consumption of organic foods in European countries is growing stronger than the area of cultivation.
The situation in Denmark is especially difficult since the cultivation area has been decreasing over the last five years whereas sales increased by 50% at the same time.
England is facing the same situation:
The cultivation area expanded only marginally by 1% whereas consumption rose by 49%.
In the past, goods were mainly exported to the US due to the favourable US$ exchange rate.
The market is about the same size as in Europe, but with very limited domestic production, i.e. high dependence on imports.
There was no discussion about where the products are currently purchased.
But if you have an importer on the one side, there is always an exporter at the other.
The largest producer of organic foods is Italy despite a rather small domestic market.
Spain, whose domestic market is even less developed, is also a leading producer who supplies the markets in the middle European countries.
The favourite distribution channel for organic foods in Europe is the food retail trade.
Only in Germany and The Netherlands, this share is less than 50%.
In Germany, however, the trend goes towards supermarkets.
The reasons to buy organic foods are food safety and regional origin.
Another important motive is the additional benefit "indulgence without a bad conscience" which researchers define as health, animal protection and environment.
The organic consumer of the future is not a homogeneous target group.
His behaviour is impulsive-driven, this means that he has to be won over at the point of sale.
The trade also benefits from the high safety of organic foods, even though the problem of residues is still evident.
However, organic is also a means to distinguish oneself in the food market.
The products are categorized somewhere between basic and additional health benefit and between low and high prices.
The undefined middle segment will be facing hard times.
It can either justify higher prices if it offers additional health benefits or else it can convince with low prices.
With regard to the purchasing sector, there will be a trend towards internationalism which bears the problem of lack of transparency and quality assurance.
"The product quality will be a dominant topic", says Hamm.
Internationalism is a trend which already lasted for some years, but has hardly been noticed until now.
A large number of organic products from hard wheat to rice to olives and coffee have to be imported, since these plants do not grow in this area.
Hamm's outlook until 2010 forecasts a strong market in all of Europe.
According to him, Eastern and Southern Europe will record high growth rates.
The purchasing industry will likely face problems of quantitative and qualitative nature.
Therefore, Prof Hamm recommended that the trade establishes its own supply chain.

Healthy convenience and consumer attitudes in Europe Pleasure, health and convenience are defined as the three mega-trends in marketing of food today.
Pleasure still comes first for most consumers, which are not ready to sacrifice enjoyment for health and convenience.
Health has become such an important trend that consumers will likely choose health, even where less convenient.
This offers marketing opportunities.
According to a recent report from Reuters there is evidence, that the prevalence of healthy convenience is not accurately captured yet.
Such products still account for a relatively small share of all product launches, with beverages being the category with the highest proportion here.
So there are more opportunities out to enforce healthy convenience, e. g. for:
• Consuming "on-the-go"
• More customized concepts
• Better kids' products Major key trends driving healthy convenience are:
• Personalized nutrition
• Daily dosing
• Physical activity, sports
• Weight management Best prospects are expected for products delivering the healthy benefits consumers want, whilst simplifying their lives.
Attitudes to food fortification Healthiness can be either delivered by addressing the inherent benefits of natural, low-processed foods, or by the addition of nutrients.
But what are the consumer attitudes towards fortification?
For two major groups of nutrients, vitamins and minerals, latest consumer research data are available now.
The HealthFocus© 2006 trend survey is looking into consumer attitudes and actions towards healthy choices.
It helps to understand, what is happening in the market for healthy foods, beverages and supplements.
Trends in consumer awareness, perception and usage of the product categories and ingredients are demonstrated.
Regarding the fortification of foods and beverages with vitamins and/or minerals the acceptance in Europe is very substantial overall.
But fortified products do have their place in the regular consumption patterns indeed.
Some more details for six major European markets, including directional trends covering the situation two years ago are shown here:
• On average, every second Western European (WE) consumer agrees, that it is important to eat foods fortified or enriched with added vitamins/minerals.
Chart 1) Sources of Vitamins and Minerals Strongly agree/agree It is important too eat foods that are fortified or enriched with added vitamins and/or minerals
Chart 2) Food Fortification Attitudes Consumers choose foods/beverages because they are fortified with extra vitamins and/or minerals
• It is most interesting to know whether consumers not only appreciate the addition of vitamins, but see it justified (and are willing) to pay a premium for products that are fortified with extra nutrition.
Indeed 37-49% of the consumers strongly agrees or agrees that such products are worth paying slightly more (chart 3).
Chart 3) Fortification Attitudes and Actions Strongly agree/agree Foods/beverages that are fortified with extra nutrition are worth paying slightly more for.
In conclusion, the European consumer attitudes and actions toward addition of vitamins and minerals are quite favorable.
How is fortification practiced then?
According to data from Mintel (GNPD) on the number of new product launches with added vitamins, the number of launches is still increasing year by year overall in European markets, for almost all food categories.
That does not imply that consumption of products moves in parallel, because also fortified products have got their life cycles, and new launches may show comparable flop rates as ordinary products.
New EU legislation will come into force in the near future by the Fortified Foods Regulation and the Health and Nutrition Claims Regulation.
It will give a harmonized framework for the EU member states and pull down existing trade barriers.
On the other hand many questions will not be answered soon, e. g. on the impact of the coming nutrient profiles.
It is expected fortified foods and beverages will continue to be an important, well accepted and safe option offered in retailers' shelves.

Global organic sales soar but supply is strained Soaring global organic food and drink sales are driving demand, but undersupply of organic ingredients is undermining the long-term stability of the sector, says a new report from Organic Monitor.
A new report of The Global Market for Organic Food & Drink by British consultancy Organic Monitor projects that revenues will approach US$40 bn (€31bn) this year as consumers increasingly seek the healthy and nutritious option.
Countries where consumers have high disposable incomes are said to be driving the demand, with Switzerland, the US and Singapore leading the way.
Over-concentration of demand could put the global organic food industry in a fragile condition, said Amarjit Sahota, director of Organic Monitor.
The shortages are most evident in North America, and, according to Organic Monitor, many US-based companies are currently scouring the globe for organic ingredients.
According to the consultancy, organic ingredients like nuts, beans, and seeds are increasingly being imported from Turkey, China, and Brazil, herbs and spices are coming from Paraguay, India, and Ethiopia, and organic fresh fruit and vegetables are increasingly coming in from African and Asian countries.
Several European countries are also experiencing supply shortages, said Organic Monitor, as consumer demand for organic foods escalates.
Even sectors previously at fault from overproduction are now suffering from undersupply.
The report also points out that divisions and differences amongst the three major trading blocks Europe, North America and Asia are impeding the global organic food and drink industry.
The Organic Monitor report, priced €1,199 (£799, $1,534), also assesses the future outlook, business opportunities and industry trends.

Meat market in Germany and the EU Poultry industry under cost pressure More money for grains and energy - call for higher producer prices The poultry industry expects significantly higher costs due to increasing grain and energy prices.
Thus, calls for higher producer prices get louder.
There is a worldwide shortage of feed grains - according to the Center for Market and Price Reporting (ZMP), consumption will be exceeding the production volume by 45 million tons in 2006.
According to the Central Association of the German poultry industry (ZDG) in Berlin, there will be a marked price increase for poultry meat due to soaring grain prices and energy costs.
"Feedstuff accounts for 60% of the production costs.
The European-wide shortage of grains and increased grain prices also have an effect on German producers", says Gerhard Wagner, President of ZDG.
Both, EU Member States and countries in Eastern Europe suffer from grain shortage; prices have already risen by 50%.
While last year, one ton of feed grain cost €105 (free works), feed manufacturers now have to pay more than €160.
The competition through bio energy production further aggravated the situation in the grain sector.
More and more often, the bio energy industry acts as a buyer on grain markets.
The additional costs would result in higher prices for producers and consumers, explains Wagner.
Otherwise, many companies might not be able to continue their production.
This is especially true for the winter time, when stables have to be heated more than usual.
Lebensmittelzeitung No. 44, November 3, 2006
Geese shortage in Germany Breeding in stables a burden - import prices on the rise The geese production will be even smaller than expected.
In the light of avian influenza and the regulation to breed poultry in stables greatly hampered this year's geese production.
Usually, geese are kept on pastures to run free for several months in Germany.
This was partially impossible or only feasible in some regions as long as strict veterinary regulations were adhered to.
Mainly small companies dreaded the additional effort and discontinued their production.
The smaller supply already reflects in higher prices.
This year's consumer prices in the food retail trade will be between €6.90 and €11.48 per kg, i.e. that the price range has expanded compared to the last year.
With a continuously low domestic production of some 4,000 tons, the self sufficiency rate is only at 14%, therefore most of the domestic demand for geese and geese meat is met by imports (29,000 tons in 2005).
They mainly come from Poland and Hungary in form of frozen whole geese.
The imported products are usually sold at a special price in the food retail trade, whereas German geese are mainly sold fresh, often directly from the producer, on weekly markets and in food specialty shops.
Besides, they can often be found on menu cards of the HRI industry.
The import volume is expected to decline in 2006.
Due to the limited supply, import prices are well above last year's level, and no one knows how this will reflect on consumer prices.
As usual, there will be huge price differences between fresh and frozen products from Germany and abroad.
In 2006, domestic and foreign suppliers are expected to meet the demand for duck and duck meat.
Last year, the German duck production amounted to a record high of 50,500 tons, thus cutting back imports.
The foreign supply, mostly provided by France, accounted for another 38,000 tons, compared to 48,000 tons in 2001.
BSE in the EU Until October 2006, a total of 210 cases of BSE have been registered in the EU, compared to 561 cases in 2005, which corresponds to a reduction of 63%.
Most of the cattle with positive test results came from Great Britain (84), where a total of 226 BSE cases were registered in 2005.
Many EU Member States recorded higher exports; at the same time, deliveries to Russia expanded significantly.
The EU pork production for 2007 is forecast to remain stable or might even expand marginally.
The Committee expects that the profitability will decline due to higher feed grain and energy prices.
Though this could be prevented through a rise of pork prices, this is unlikely to happen in the first half of 2007.
EU in need of beef Gap between consumption and production expanding After five consecutive years, the EU beef market is expected to show another deficit in 2007.
In their latest forecast of international meat markets, the Washington Agricultural Department anticipates the gap between consumption and production to grow even further.
All in all, net imports of some 360,000 tons would be necessary to meet the beef demand of the 25 Member States.
However, due to the high consumer prices, US experts expect only marginal increases in consumption with the production to stagnate at 7.88 million tons.
High prices for grains and feed will likely slow down the beef production, which might cause producers in Eastern European countries to stop their production altogether.
In Western Europe, where large producers like Spain and France already produce without receiving any premiums, the competition between the beef industry and the bio energy market for cultivation areas and feedstuff is growing steadily.
EU beef exports are anticipated to reach only 200,000 tons - also due to the continuously strong EU currency.
Over the last years, Europe has completely separated from the development on the world market, which has been growing steadily.
At the same time, another two large producers, the US and Brazil will be re-entering the international market:
Their exports had been banned after the outbreak of BSE and foot and mouth disease.
China ahead of the EU The beef production in China is forecast to rise by 5.5% to 7.91 million tons in 2007, thus pushing the EU-25 (estimate: 7.88 million tons) back on the fourth place of the world's leading beef producers.
The United States remain the largest producer by far with 12.17 million tons, followed by Brazil with 9.12 million tons.

Fish Market Germans love fish German consumers develop an increasing appetite for fish.
Compared to 2005, the per capita consumption in 2006 is expected to rise by 5% to 15.5 kg, reported the Fish Information Center (FIZ) in Hamburg.
Even marked price increases hardly had a negative impact on the soaring demand.
Lebensmittelzeitung No. 49, December 8, 2006
Fish increasingly popular in the hotel and catering trade Fish and seafood is more frequently served in German restaurants.
In order to identify the most popular fish variety among German chefs and the trend fish of the future, the German wholesaler 'Deutsche See' initiated a survey among more than 1,000 chefs of the German HRI trade.
The result:
More than 80% of the chefs confirmed that their guests have been consuming more fish and seafood in the last five years.
The survey revealed that pike-perch, salmon and plaice are the guests' favourites.
The importance of regional fish varieties is growing.
High prices for Irish salmon after crop failure Due to the unusually hot summer, the Irish salmon industry registers a drastic decline in salmon production and announces price increases.
Extraordinarily high water temperatures at the Irish West Coast made salmon reduce their nutrition intake, which, in turn, lead to slower growth of the fish.
In 2005, Ireland produced 20,000 tons of salmon, of which 1,000 tons were delivered to Germany.
Main clients of Irish fish producers are Great Britain, France and Belgium.
USA overtakes Switzerland as leading market The greatest choice of MSC-labelled products is now available in America following a rapid increase in use of the MSC eco-label by seafood brands and retailers.
For five years Switzerland has offered consumers the largest number of sustainable MSC-labelled seafood products, but in October America overtook Switzerland's 75 products and is currently leading the world with a choice of 93 lines.
The products include halibut fillets on the wet fish counter at Whole Foods Market, pre-packed surimi in Wal-Mart, and Trident's premium wild Alaska salmon burgers.
"For the first time American consumers can choose from a wide range of MSC-labelled products, meaning that anyone can be part of the drive for ocean-friendly seafood.
That's a great achievement for all the companies that have worked to move the American market forward," said Jim Humphreys, Director of the MSC's Americas regional office.
Meanwhile, Europe is fighting back.
In October, German processor Deutsche See launched 19 MSC-labelled products, including several foodservice options, and the Lidl retail chain also began offering MSC-labelled products in its German stores.
Newsletter MSC Fish4Thought November 2006
Discounter Lidl lists MSC products For the first time, hard discounter Lidl lists 8 frozen fish products which bear the MSC logo (Marine Stewardship Councils).
Since the end of August, Lidl subsidiaries have gradually been supplied with ocean-friendly seafood, reports the Norwegian magazine 'IntraFish'.
Besides, Lidl also sells Iglo's MSC-labelled brand name products and will continue to offer the classical fish fingers made of Russian Alaska Pollack.
The MSC-labelled articles are produced by Frosta and Greenland.
So far, Lidl has not communicated the introduction of MSC-labelled products to its customers.
Concept-wise, the fish products from sustainable fishing are close to the products offered under the brand name 'fair globe', whose production and trade is characterized by sustainable and environmentally friendly fabrication.
Germany's leading discounter 'Aldi' does not yet offer any MSC-labelled products.
FischMagazin 11/2006
Deutsche See launches wide range of MSC certified products The leading (fish and seafood) supplier on the German market Deutsche See has long been committed to sustainable fisheries as reflected in several initiatives as well as a steadily increasing series of organic products.
In September the company went a step further by launching a range of products certified by the Marine Stewardship Council.
All in all nineteen items were added to the company's assortment based on hoki, wild salmon, Alaska saithe, and matjes herring.
The company also plans to expand the MSC-certified range later this year to include saithe and zander.
By adding these MSC certified products to our assortment we are making an unequivocal statement of our commitment to the principles of sustainable fishing and the protection of the environment.
We are convinced that taking this step will assist in promoting the conservation of stocks, said Peter Dill, the managing director.
For the MSC, too, the addition of its label to so many products at one time will create a greater awareness of the organization on the important German market.
Beverages Energy drinks market continues to sparkle West Europe's energy drink sales accelerated by 15 percent to a volume of 383 million litres and a value of over €3 billion in 2005, according to drinks consultancy Zenith International.
Albeit from a much smaller base, France was the fastest growing market, followed by Norway, Finland and Ireland all registering growth in excess of 20 percent.
"Although Red Bulls supremacy remains, it has witnessed some erosion of market share.
Various other brands and supermarket own labels have now been available long enough to have carved out their own niche and secure their presence."
The only brands to claim the distinction of outselling Red Bull head to head are Hartwall's ED and Carlsberg's Battery in Finland.
This sector is especially lucrative as consumers appear to be prepared to pay a relatively high price per litre for single-serve units of convenience and energy boosting drinks.
Consumption of sports drinks is also rising fast in many Asian markets.

Bag-in-Box packaging to replace steel kegs The brewing industry could change to Bag-in-Box packaging to replace stainless steel kegs, as a result of recent development by a German consortium of Rapak, Ankerbrau Brewery and SPN, according to Today's News on December 4th.
Intended to reduce the high weight and cost of conventional kegs, the new product uses a polyethylene bag housed in a card container made from recycled paper.
The brewery industry makes large annual losses due to the theft and/or non-return of large numbers of the expensive metal kegs and their heavy weight adds considerably to transport costs.
As well as overcoming these obstacles, the Bag-in-Box system requires no pressurisation during transportation and takes up less space because of its cubic shape.
Estimates suggest that savings of up to €20 (US$ 27) per hectolitre will be made with the introduction of this system.
Following this development, Ankerbrau is currently switching to Bag-in-Box kegs for its export beers.

"Karla" listed in many pharmacies The world's first wellness drink on beer basis, which is exclusively distributed through pharmacies, turns into a hit, reports 'Karlsberg' brewery.
They announce that "Karla" has been successfully launched in Rhineland Palatine, which is a first step towards a national marketing of the product.
The distribution will be handled by Amapharm, a distributor of pharmaceutical products.
More than 800 pharmacies have shown interest in "Karla balance" and "Karla wellness".
"One hundred pharmacies are already selling 'Karla'", explains Andreas Kaufmann, Strategic Project Manager of Amapharm.
The German wine market In 2005, Germans consumed some 16.6 million hectolitres of wine and 2.9 million hectolitres of sparkling wine.
This makes Germany the world's fourth largest consumer market for wine.
The lion's share comes from abroad:
According to figures from the Federal Office for Statistics, wine imports amounted to 13.2 million hectolitres in 2005.
Following fourth to seventh are Chile, Australia, the US and South Africa.
Chile, being the largest supplier from overseas, delivers larger volumes to Germany than Austria and Portugal together.
Fruit mulled wine established It seems that fruit mulled wine has established itself as seasonal product for the winter time.
The Association of the German Fruit Wine and Fruit Champagne Industry is expecting sales increases in the following months.
Last year, fruit mulled wine also registered huge growth in terms of value, thus being one of the few segments with potential to add value in a beverage market which is characterized by price decline.
The fruity alternative to traditional mulled wine is an addition to the range of hot beverages for cold winter days, at the same time it meets consumers' demand for change and variety of flavours.
The trade offers traditional varieties made of local fruits as well as hot met or new aromatic recipes of fruit mulled wine with typical Christmas flavours.
Besides, apple wine producers also carry special winter products or add recipes for apple mulled wine to their original product.
Miscellaneous News Imports scrutinized by German authorities There is no other European member state which tests food products for residues of pesticides as often as Germany.
According to a report of the European Commission for 2004, every fourth of the total of 55,000 fruit, vegetable and grain controls in the EU was carried out by German authorities.
The industry association 'Agrar e.V.' commented that even these levels are 'far' from being hazardous to human health.
AUSTRIA Austrian exports on the rise The latest analysis of Bank Austria Creditanstalt shows that the Austrian food industry has well managed its accession to the European Union.
The necessary restructuring measures were realized successfully.
The largest individual sectors are slaughterhouses and meat processors who together realized a turnover of €2.5 billion.
Accumulated turnover figures for the dairy and beverage industry added up to €2 billion; fruit and vegetable processors realized €1.2 billion.
The Austrian export trade is still dominated by raw materials.
However, experts anticipate that exports of higher-priced value-added food products will be increasing.
Lebensmittelzeitung No. 48, December 1, 2006
Investments on record high In 2005, Austria was a favourite destination for German direct investments.
This was revealed by Austrian Business Agency (ABA), an organisation affiliated with the Austrian Ministry of Economics.
The balance of payments statistics of Deutsche Bank which were published in May 2006 designated Austria as a top destination for German investments.
German direct investments in Austria amounted to €4,591 million in 2005, the highest number in the last three years.
Therefore, Austria is Germany's third important investment destination within the EU, following The Netherlands (€8,881 million) and UK (€6,226 million).
Worldwide, only the Netherlands, the UK and Switzerland (€4,774 million) rank ahead of Austria.
"What is impressive is that German companies invested more money in Austria in 2005 than in future markets like China and India or German CEE partners like Poland and Slovakia", comments Rene Siegl, General Manager of ABA.
Sweet Première in Vienna For the first time, the Austrian capital will be hosting an international chocolate event.
From Oct 6 - 8, 2006, the "Wiener Künstlerhaus" (Vienna House of Artists) will hold this event under the motto "Choco Vienna".
International exhibitors will be presenting first class chocolate products and luxury creations made of cocoa beans.
Through many events such as product tasting and live productions, the fair organisers create an ideal atmosphere for talks between producers and end users - from chocoholics to trade visitors.
The event is an attractive platform for the new lifestyle subject "Chocolate".
There will be a poster exhibition at the Künstlerhaus, and a Choco Film Matinée at the cinema where three chocolate movies will be shown every day.
The festival dates have been chosen carefully to match the traditional 'long night of museums' on Oct 7, 2006.

Less wine in Austria Far below average - white wine production decreasing In Austria, the below-average wine harvest in 2005 also reflects in the development of the white and red wine supply.
The Austrian statistics also show that by the end of July, almost two thirds of the total wine volume (some 1.77 million hl) was stocked in Lower Austria.
The volumes in stock in Burgenland amount to 605,800 hl, besides 163,200 hl in Styria and 104,300 hl in Vienna.
Meanwhile, beer consumption is reported at only 20% of the levels attended in the '90.
Per capita beer consumption has been reported to have increased by 0.9 litres thus reaching 56.4 l.
Even if the national beer output progressed hardly, imports gained by 9.9% and totalled 774,331 hl.
Profit margins and growing expenses put a heavy pressure on local brewers.
According to the local brewers association, the entire brewing sector's turnover stands at CHF1 billion.
The Switzerland Brewers Association groups 19 companies with 21 brewing sites which cover over 98% of the domestic beer production.

A crisis for organic supermarkets in Switzerland?
The Swiss organic supermarkets Yardo in St. Gallen and Rägeboge in Winterthur have had to release some employees.
The idea of supermarkets for organic products in the country has been regarded critically from the very beginning.
As if to prove the concept is not working, two stores are fighting for their survival after only a short time.
Yardo opened in February 2006 with the aim of having thirteen branches all over Switzerland, but two employees had to be laid off in September.
The manager said that he had misjudged the situation - he originally thought customers would need more service.
The larger store is Rägeboge, which developed by merging two subsidiaries that had existed for 20 years.
A coffee shop and a drug store were added a year ago, but costs were too high, turnover too low and investments too expensive.
The store has suffered major problems over the past three months, including laying off some employees.
The situation seems stable now - but the company will need another 3 or 4 years and one million Swiss francs to break even. www.woz.ch Source:
Last week, Doris Leuthard, Minister for Economic Affairs, announced to renew the Federal Law on Technical Trade Barriers (Bundesgesetz über die technischen Handelshemmnisse THG).
This would mean that Swiss distributors and European importers could more easily trade food products, household appliances, textiles and cosmetics in Switzerland.
Until now, special regulations have been preventing or hampering import and trade activities.
They required that many products had to be re-labelled, re-tagged or re-licensed to be distributed in Switzerland.
Apart from high agricultural subsidies, Swiss regulations were the main reason why many products are much more expensive in Switzerland than in the EU.
In order to fight this 'high-price island', the Federal Council wants to introduce the 'Cassis-de-Dijon' principle.
This principle - developed by the European Court of Justice in 1979 -aligns most Swiss product regulations with those of the European Union.
Thus, Minister Leuthard intends to reduce the current number of exemptions in Switzerland (120) to only 40.
Meanwhile, an official hearing has been opened, which means that interest groups, political parties and administration groups can comment and make a demand on this proposal.
Besides, the Minister for Economic Affairs wants to fight discrimination of Swiss producers.
The draft law of the Federal Council demands that Swiss producers will be able to produce their goods according to EU regulations and distribute them in Switzerland.
But it could take some time until the drafts turn into concrete laws.
What is most important is that the new Federal Law on Technical Trade Barriers needs to be resistant to any referendum, says a Swiss trade specialist [who wants to remain anonymous].
Swiss farmers will fight any liberalisation of the market.
"If farmers threaten with a referendum, the procedure can drag on for several years", explains the specialist.
It would be 'sensational' if the new law came into force on 1st January 2008; 2009 would be more likely.
However, the Interest Group of Swiss Distributors (IG DHS), which counts Coop, Denner or Migros among their members, is convinced that this development cannot be held back.
The direct import allows Denner to sell the tooth paste for CHF 1.00 less than their competitors, says Eva-Maria Bauder, Press Spokeswoman of Denner and IG DHS.
According to estimates of Rudolf Strahm (who monitors product prices), foreign producers realize CHF 25 to 30 billion through their high price policy.
Trade experts anticipate that foreign distributors like Aldi Suisse will profit the most.
The new regulations will make it easier for the German discounter to position long-standing suppliers in Switzerland.
The Spokesman with Aldi Suisse, however, did not want to comment on this.

November HIE - Health Ingredients Europe International trade fair for food ingredients, Frankfurt, Germany Nov 14 - 16, 2006, www.hi-events.com
For the first time, ProWein claims the role as the world's leading fair - ahead of the other international trade fairs in Bordeaux, Verona and London.
The closing report counts "considerably more than 30,000 trade visitors from 40 nations" (compared to 28,000 in 2005).
The number of foreign wine experts increased by 26 %, those coming from overseas even doubled.
Moreover, the show welcomed 750 journalists from 33 countries.
With 2,900 exhibitors from 46 nations, decision-makers found a truly global market overview at this year's event.
"ProWein is a major fixture for the European wine and spirits trade and has continued to develop its role as the leading fair for the global wine and spirits business," was also the verdict from Wilhelm Niedergöker, Managing Director of Messe Düsseldorf.
The European dimension is further proof of growing interest from buyers from the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Austria, Sweden, Switzerland, Great Britain and Eastern Europe.
The fact that the German food retail trade accepted this event is of particular importance to trade fair exhibitors.
There is no other place where so much wine is imported, and buyers of the retail trade made good use of this opportunity.
On the evening of the second trade fair date, most buyers had already been in every hall.
The sparkling wine industry was almost completely represented.
Henkell and Rotkäppchen with appropriately large stands, and after a break Schloss Wachenheim was again represented this year.
Campari was the only leading manufacturer among 313 exhibitors of spirits; large distributors like Maxxium or Diageo did not exhibit at the show.
Those who were there could count on the attendance of high-profile buyers.
One of the most important topics was the price.
Confectionery BDSI:
Production and market volume above 2004 levels Right in time for the AGM of the BDSI the Federal Statistical Office published their (preliminary) full year confectionery production figures for 2005.
According to the findings, production in 2005 rose by 55,000 tons, or 1.6% up to 3,407 tons.
Just before the ISM the BDSI had forecast an increase of 0.3% up to 3.374 m tons.
The Federal Statistical Office reported production value of EUR 11.443 billion, an increase of EUR 187 million or 1.7%.
BDSI estimates in January anticipated a dip of 0.5% in production value down to EUR 11,222 billion.
According to the preliminary results, the production volume of the chocolate confectionery rose by 0.5% up to 859,666 tons worth EUR 4.409 billion, an increase in value of 2.3%.
Sugar confectionery production volume increased by 1.4% up to 545,549 tons worth EUR 1.769 billion.
Fine pastries production volume was up by 2.8% to 713,131 tons worth EUR 2.179 billion (+1.0%).
Snacks production grew 0.8% and totalled 284,084 tons worth EUR 717 million (+3.2%).
The highest increases in production volume and value in terms of percentages were reported for ice cream, which grew 5.8% to reach 367,210 tons worth EUR 956 million (+5.4%).
According to the BDSI domestic confectionery market volume in 2005 rose by 1.2% or 32,000 tons to total 2.621 million tons worth EUR 9.399 billion (+0.6%).
With the population of Germany currently 82.5 million, this translates into a per capita consumption of 31.76 kg (+1.2%), with spending on confectionery amounting to EUR 113.93 per head in 2005 (+0.6%).
Confectionery imports declined Confectionery imports (including semi-finished articles) declined both in volume (-11.6%, 846,184 tons) and in value (-9.3%, EUR 2.325 bn).
Imports accounted for 24.8% of domestic market volume, down from 28.6% the year before, and slid from 22.8% to 20.3% in terms of market value.
There was a double digit decrease in shipments from EU states while imports from third countries increased.
In 2005 there were 267 companies employing over 20 people in the German confectionery industry sector.
The number of employees in the confectionery industry dropped from 56,115 in 2004 to 54,608 in 2005 (-2.7%).
Sales totalled EUR 13.586 bn.

Nine new markets were opened in 2005 alone.
Apart from a few independent retailers, it is mostly the chains like Bio Company, eo AG, LPG, Viv BioFrischemarkt and the organic discounter Mc Bio that have developed the market in the German capital until now.
Erdkorn Bio-Discount was the first chain from outside Berlin when it opened a store there last year.
Alnatura and Basic are also planning to open new stores and have already found sites.
The number of organic supermarkets in Berlin should top 40 this year.

Organic supermarkets account for the highest growth rates.
"Bio is booming" is the overall opinion among market researchers.
Other distributors are also heavily expanding.
"All signs indicate growth", says Dr. Felix Prinz von Löwenstein, CEO of the Association of the Ecological Food Industry (BÖWL).
Some EUR 1.6 billion is sold via health food stores and organic supermarkets.
The largest organic supermarket chains are 'Alnatura' with 22 subsidiaries and the Munich 'Basic AG' with 15 subsidiaries.
Besides, there are a number of other players: smaller organic chains (Erdkorn, Denns, and SuperBioMarkt) and independent retailers, who run one or two supermarkets.
The top 10 chains only hold about one third of all organic supermarkets.
"Concentration will rise markedly", forecasts Christoph Spahn, CEO of Biovista.
He estimates that in 2007, 50% of the organic markets will be organized in retail chains.
Retailers with limited sales area are increasingly under pressure.
Despite the current organic boom, conventional retailers show only little interest to become active in the organic market.
With 'Vierlinden', Rewe is the only one to run his own concept.
"The defensive expansion strategy does not look like a recipe for success", comments Spahn.
"Unfortunately, the big players cannot profit from their efficient logistics.
On an average sales area of 400 sqm, sales margins reach up to 30 % and the return on sales up to 5 %.
Stores with 80-150 m² even had to come to terms with a decline in turnover of nearly 2 %.
This information has been produced by the specialist wholefood trade barometer operated by the business and organisation consultants wob-Hartmann in Solingen.
Of the people interviewed, 47 % said that their specialist shop had increased its shopping area over five years; in the case of 41 % the floor space had remained the same.
7 % were expecting to join a chain system, 1 % thought they would get smaller and 4% were anticipating closure.

Discounters boosting organic products *without direct marketing  Source:
ZMP on the basis of the GfK consumer panel Demand still on record high - product shortages on some supply markets - price increases not to last The growing demand for organic food products leads to supply problems for certain items.
Though prices are rising on the producer level, experts anticipate a dampening effect through the price calculation of the discounters.
The experts of the Center for Market and Price Reporting (ZMP) forecast a double-digit growth in the organic market in 2006.
Due to the high demand, organic raw materials are running low which leads to an increase in producer prices.
However, this effect will not last long.
Most participants of the ZMP Eco-Workshop in Berlin expect that the low-price strategy of the discounters, which are increasingly entering the market, will put producer prices under pressure.
The situation is especially unstable in the organic dairy segment.
The increase in turnover with milk, yogurt and curd cheese reached more than 20 % in 2004 and 2005.
Due to the strong demand, the surplus on the German organic dairy market could be reduced.
Arla even supplies organic butter from Denmark.
Towards the end of 2005, organic milk was running low.
New organic producers are needed; some dairies even increased their organic output.
But in this relatively small organic dairy market, even small increases can turn a shortage into a surplus.
Despite the high growth rates, organic products still account for modest market shares in the food retail trade, with fresh milk being the most important item.
The share of turnover of organic milk is at 7.4 %, compared to 6 % in 2004 and 8.6 % in December 2005.
In terms of volume, the share was at 5.4 % in 2005, compared to 4.3 % in 2004.
There are shortages in the supply of organic meat, but experts anticipate the production of organic pigs to be increased in the current year.
Not every company that wants to add organic meat and sausages to their product line will receive the requested volumes.
According to ZMP, this explains the rather small share of organic meat as part of the total meat consumption: not even 1 % (without direct distribution).
Since the second half of 2005, the conventional food industry has demonstrated huge engagement in organic products.
Though the food retail trade mainly focuses on carrots, onions, tomatoes and cucumbers in their organic segment, many supermarkets already change their organic vegetable range each week.
The growing offer of discounters is further driving the demand.
Compared to 2004, consumers spent 21 % more on organic vegetables (the largest organic product group in terms of value), however, the share of organic vegetables as part of the total vegetable range accounts for only 4 %.
The share of organic potatoes is slightly higher, at 4.4 %.
After the high demand during the last winter, when discounters increased their offer of organic potatoes, German farmers plan to expand their production.
According to the first estimates, the cultivation area will increase by 5 to 10 % compared to last years' results.

First IFOAM International Conference on organic wild production From May 3rd to 4th 2006 in Teslic, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the first IFOAM International Conference on Organic Wild Production addressed the burgeoning sector for diverse wild harvested products.
The conference has been organized together by the Agricultural Institute of the Republic of Srpska in Banja Luka, consultants Grolink AB and IFOAM.
In preparation for the conference, the International Trade Center, one of the conference partners, commissioned a study titled "Overview of Production and Marketing of Organic Wild Products".
The study documents current global production, and identifies an impressive 376 different organic wild products currently being produced for the global organic market, ranging from medicinal and aromatic plants, nuts, fruits, edible mushrooms and other products.
Covering 64 countries and representing 60-80 % of the global total for organic wild production, the survey finds that at least 60 million hectares worldwide are certified for organic wild production, producing over 200,000 tons. www.ifoam.org Source:
High demand for organic milk The demand for organic milk and milk products increased during the last two years.
Sales of organic milk beverages, yogurt and curd cheese rose by more than 20 % both in 2004 and 2005, analyzed the Center for Market and Price Reporting (ZMP).
The former excess supply has thus been reduced; some regions are even short of organic milk, which results in rising producer prices.

News Ticker The German government currently plans to continue the Federal Organic Agriculture Programme at a cost of EUR 20 million per year.
Fruit Juices Growing pressure for manufacturers of fruit juices Ranking of 2005 almost unchanged - overall cost increases - discounters dominating Compared to the previous year, there has hardly been any change in Germany's ranking of the top fruit juice manufacturers in 2005.
With almost identical sales figures, the top 6 were able to maintain their position, some of the following companies moved one position up or down.
On the one hand, prices for fruit concentrates (duty paid) have risen steeply.
Whereas prices for fruit concentrates increased from some US$ 900 to US$ 1,600 until fall 2005, prices were up to US$ 1,900 at the end of January 2006.
On the other hand gas prices continue to rise which leads to high costs for logistics.
The situation gets even more serious through the decline of industrial production in the previous year, down by 9.7 % to 3.41 billion litres.
According to the German Fruit Industry Association (VdF), sales in 2005 were 2.6 % below previous year's level.
Besides, production of fruit-based soft drinks also declined, down by 2.9 % to 3.56 billion litres.
The fact that the production volume of the 23 companies increased slightly to 5.08 billion litres is due to a strong export ratio of 23.5 %.
According to preliminary figures from VdF, the per-capita consumption in Germany dropped from 40.3 to 39.5 litres, or even less.
One effect of the growing presence of discounters is that 66 % of the fruit juice is sold through this distribution channel.
Together with low-price products in the traditional food retail trade, the total volume of low-price juices and nectars is about 80 %.
The air is getting increasingly thin for brand producers.
It is well possible that the pressure from many sides might force some producers to give up business.
Moreover, private label manufacturers are also complaining about shrinking margins.
But these are still not all of the problems the industry is facing.
Though there is no deposit on fruit juices, a change in the packaging industry is under way.
The industry has a growing preference for PET bottles to point out the high value of their product line.

The household panel of consumption researchers GfK showed that edible fats recorded a decrease in 2005, down from 1.18 million in 2003 to 1.11 million tons two years later.
Sales of edible oils dropped from 174.7 million litres in 2003 to 172.6 million litres last year.
In the two previous years, their share accounted for only 4.8 % (2003) and 7.3 % (2004).
According to GfK, canola oil is the only edible oil which registered a sales increase of 17 % between 2004 and 2005 (in volume terms).
No other oil recorded comparable increases in the last year.
Sunflower oil and plant oil have been losing market shares for years.
Olive oil, which had been growing in the past, also lost in 2005.
Positive sales of deli food Although the cost of raw materials did have a negative impact on deli food producers last year, they were still able to achieve a respectable growth.
According to the market research institute GfK, the market grew by 5 percent last year, with deli salads contributing most of the growth in terms of volume.
At the annual meeting of the German deli food producers "Bundesverband der deutschen Feinkostindustrie e.V." in Wiesbaden, its chairman Michael Hamker said that the whole sector is under enormous pressure already and that this will continue in 2006 and 2007.
One reason given is that agricultural raw materials such as vegetable oils and agricultural alcohol are being promoted for their use as a source of energy for technical purposes.
This had pushed the price of the raw materials up to an entirely new level, and producers have already said that prices would continue to rise.
These basic materials are the basis for things like mayonnaise and salad dressings.
The price of vegetable oil has increased by 30 per cent over the past few months, while the price of spirits vinegar has increased by 18 per cent.

German egg consumption The egg consumption in Germany decreased slightly in 2005.
The per capita consumption dipped from 210 in 2004 to 206 in 2005.
All in all, a total of 16.97 billion eggs were consumed.
The self-sufficiency rate sank by 0.5 % to 70.2 %.
The industry turnover (in terms of retail prices) rose by 3 % to EUR 1.91 billion, reported the industry organisation 'Eis Info Service'.
The per capita consumption of ice cream reached an average of 8.1 litres in Germany, i.e. 0.3 litres more than in 2004.
This way, the industry slightly recovered from the rainy summer 2004.
Baby Food New impetus for baby food In light of decreasing birth rates, the German clientèle for baby food is shrinking.
They focus increasingly on food for toddlers from 1 to 3 years and point out the convenience aspect of their products.
Discounters' growing engagement, manufacturers' ever broader range of private labels and comprehensive relaunches in the brand products industry are all signs that the German baby food industry is far from standing still.
But what is true for activities in the trade and industry does not apply to turnover figures.
The market stagnated in 2005.
According to market researchers ACNielsen, total turnover amounted to about €583 million.
Market leader Hipp accounts for a market share of 44.8 % with its products Hipp and Bebivita.
Following second is the Swiss 'Nestlé' Group (26.8 %) with its products Alete and Beba.
Private labels account for another 6 %.
They are also very optimistic for the development of milk puddings (wet and instant).
Turnover figures for this category are forecast to rise by 1 %, driven, among others, by the launch of Milupa's new drinkable meals.
This would mean a reverse development compared to recent years.
In 2005, the segment of baby nutrition, comprising fresh milk pudding, instant milk pudding etc., also suffered from a decrease in turnover, down by 3.2 percent to about €52.3 million compared to 2004.
However, manufacturers still see huge potential in this segment, for example when broadening the range of products for more toddlers of one year and older.
Just like Humana with its Junior Drink, Milupa also wants to profit from this trend:
"The time young mothers feed baby food is extending", says Stefan Stohl of Milupa.
Larger target group Consequently, a broader target group (babies up to one year and older) and convenience products bear huge opportunities for manufacturers.
"We have the knowledge to offer healthy and balanced products for one to three-year-olds", claims Stohl.
"The example of the brand 'Milupino', which clearly contributed to the added value, shows that this could be the right way", says Stohl.
Here, the turnover rose from €12.5 million in 2004 to €13.7 million last year.
One example is Hipp's recent launch of breakfast mueslis for babies.
"We introduced 68 new articles in 2005 alone", says Reiner Tafferner, Marketing Director with Hipp.
Consumers only accept manufacturers which show competency throughout a broad product line.
This also applies to the different distribution channels.
"The discussion about discounters is overrated", he explains.
The sale of baby food through this distribution channel will not be successful; it would lack competence and service.
However, researching new products is very expensive.
"It is normal that the price pressure increases in a market which is stagnating or partly decreasing", is how Inga Schaumann, Spokeswoman of Humana GmbH, explains the strong competition.
Consumers are also increasingly sensitive to prices.
More than 60 % of all pre-packed meat is sold by discounters.
The turnover of meat and charcuterie rose by 1 % in 2005 according to the meat processor Stockmeyer, due to prices rising by 2 %.
Sales fell slightly, by 1 %.
Stockmeyer's market research team has evaluated the data from GfK household panels and come to the conclusion that this growth has been based on the decline of meat sold over the counter which lost by 7 %.
Turnover here fell by 5 % whilst sales of pre-packed meat rose by 2 % and turnover increased by 6 %.
The remaining 4 % are for canned meat and charcuterie products, which are also declining.
62 % of all pre-packed meat sold in 2005 was sold by discounters, compared to 61.7 % the previous year.
They are followed by superstores with 25.7 % (27 %) and supermarkets with 6.8 % (6.7 %).

Consumers buy as much meat as last year.
In the first quarter of 2006, private households purchased as much frozen and fresh beef and pork as in the same year-earlier period, sausages and other meat products registered an increase of 1.5 %.
In the last three months of 2005, the 'rotten meat scandal' lead to a drop in meat purchases of 5 %, sausages were down by 3 %, revealed the figures of ZMP/CMA market researchers on the basis of the household panel of GfK (...).
"However, consumers seem to be more critical when buying meat", comments ZMP.
They visited more frequently specialty shops with service counters or butchers, whereas purchases of pre-packed fresh meat were declining.
On the other hand, the meat sales of self-service markets dropped by 7.3 %, discounters also sold less fresh meat than expected.
Contrary to the red meat, the sausages and meat products registered an unbroken trend towards self-service products: a rise of 3.4 %, compared to a drop of 1.4 % for unpacked products.

Poultry production on the rise In 2005, German poultry production increased by 3.5 % to some 1.2 million tons, revealed the preliminary report of the Federal Ministry of Economics and ZMP.
At the same time, poultry consumption was stagnating at about 1.46 million tons.
This corresponds to a per-capita consumption of 17.7 kg, the same amount as in 2004.
Imports of poultry rose to 772,000 tons in 2005, after a decline of 12 % in the previous year.
Since the production exceeded the import volume in 2005, the self sufficiency rate was up by 2.8 percentage points, reaching 82 %.
Poultry exports amounted to 378,000 tons, i.e. 6 % more than in 2004.
Consequently, the import surplus shrank to 262,000 tons.
With a production volume of 782,000 tons, chicken accounted for the lion's share of the poultry production.
Of the total poultry consumption, the share of turkey increased from 28 % in 1994 to 36 % in 2004.
However, the growth slowed down over the last years.
For the first time, the per-capita consumption of turkey slightly decreased by 100 grams to 6.4 kg.
The net production of turkey, based on the number of registered slaughters, amounted to 391,000 tons, a drop of 1.5 % compared to the record year 2004.
The gross production of 359,000 tons remained almost stagnant, which means that less live turkey was imported.
In terms of slaughter weight, imports of live turkey declined by 16.6 % to 321,000 tons.
With a volume of 700 tons, exports of live turkey only played a minor role.
In 2005, imports as well as exports of turkey rose by 5,000 tons each, amounting to 245,000 and 108,000 tons respectively. www.zmp.de Source:

Avian influenza in turkey stocks For the first time, the avian influenza virus type H5N1 has been detected in commercial poultry in Germany.
The Social Ministry in Saxony confirmed on April 5 that a feeding farm in Wermsdorf, Saxony, was affected.
The samples were examined in the reference laboratory of Friedrich-Loeffler-Insitut on the island Riems.
About 16,000 animals were culled, thereof 8,000 turkeys, 5,000 geese and 3,000 chickens.
Until the time of going to press it was still unclear how the virus had infected the farm.
Frozen fish increased by 9.1% in 2004 According to the German Institute for Frozen Food in Cologne, the total consumption of frozen fish increased by 9.1 % in 2004, up to 262,000 tons.
The demand for natural fish filets was especially high - sales amounted to 60,300 tons, an increase of 11.8 % compared to the previous year.
Fish meals like gourmet filets realized an increase in turnover of 10.8%.
Fish steaks in batter recorded a growth of 9.5 % (in terms of volume).
Almost 65 % of the frozen fish were consumed by private households, i.e. some 170,000 tons, with fish fingers being the No. 1 product with a volume of 43,700 tons.
Natural frozen fish filets followed second place (39,200 tons), fish meals ranked third.
Guests in canteens, hotels and the restaurant industry most frequently ordered fish steaks in batter, of which a volume of 44,200 tons was consumed.

Test of German Consumer organisation:
The good news:
None of the raw or cooked prawns contained any harmful residues.
But there were huge differences in taste and texture - the comments reached from 'fresh and juicy' to 'medicinal aftertaste' and 'gum-like meat'.
Besides 'good' product marks for Costa, Deutsche See, Paulus and Ristic (with an organic product), it was well received that all of them show high environmental awareness and social responsibility towards their employees.
Raw king prawns from Norma, Tip, Wal-Mart, Aldi North and Aldi South were also tested 'good'.
Two products - 'La Caldera King Prawns' from Lidl and large king prawn tails sold under Edeka's private label 'Gut & Guenstig' - were ranked 'inadequate', in part due to sensory defects.
Frozen cod prices forecast to remain stable Frozen cod fillet prices will remain largely stable in European markets in the second half of this year, perhaps even decline, after an upward trend over the past year, according to a Food and Agriculture Organisation fisheries analyst.
Part of the downward pressure on prices is due to the increasing supplies from low cost China and the weak US dollar.
The forecast will come as some relief for processors.
In Germany, they have paid an average of three per cent more for cod fillet blocks over the past year to May.
Processors in Germany were paying a delivered price of € 5.35/kg in May 2006, according to the European Price Report (EPR) for the month.
Based on EPR indications, frozen cod prices have not increased as strongly in European markets as other frozen fillet prices, such as Alaska pollock, saithe and hake, over the period, stated Gerry O'Sullivan in a report for Globefish, a unit of the Food and Agriculture Organisation.
"With the current weakness in the US dollar likely to persist, the recent upward trend in frozen groundfish fillet prices in European markets appears unlikely to continue into the second half of 2006," wrote O'Sullivan.
"In this context, frozen cod fillet prices may be expected to remain stable, or come under downward pressure, in the months ahead."
The current stability in frozen cod prices is also reflected in average unit values for Norwegian fillet exports which have been stable during the March to April period at just over NOK44/kg (€ 5.60) and up two per cent on April 2005, he notes.
Export volumes from Norway this year are also stable at about 7,000 tonnes, a level in line with exports during the first quarter of last year.
In France, the decline in volume imports during 2005 has continued into 2006.
French imports fell two per cent last year to 15,700 tonnes, compared to 2004.
For the first two months of this year, imports are down four per cent compared to the same period last year.
The decline in France's imports this year was mostly due to a fall in volumes from Iceland and Norway.
Imports from Iceland fell by 37 per cent, and from Norway by 14 per cent compared to the January to February 2005 period.
The country's imports from China are down slightly this year following a 23 per cent increase during 2005.
China's share of French imports is up to just over 22 per cent of the total.
For the early months of 2006, China was the leading supplier of frozen cod fillets to the French market.
Norway, the top supplier in recent years, has dropped to second position in volume terms although it remains the leading supplier in value terms.
China is also forging ahead in the UK market, the largest European importer of cod fillets.
The UK imported 79,080 tonnes last year, a slight drop from 2004.
China overtook Iceland to become the second volume supplier just behind Denmark, which remains the number one exporter to the UK despite an 11 per cent fall in supplies during 2005.
Meanwhile China increased its supplies to the UK market by 10 per cent to 16,470 tonnes.
China's increasing penetration of the UK market is based on its low cost production advantage over traditional European suppliers, stated O'Sullivan.
UK import unit values confirm China as the lowest cost supplier among leading exporters, he said.
An average unit value for frozen cod fillets from China was £2.48, compared to £3.80 from Iceland, £3.35 from Norway, and £3.11 from Denmark.
China is getting competition from the Russian Federation, registered the biggest %age increase last year.
Supplies of fillets to the UK from this source jumped 35 per cent on 2004 to 9,000 tonnes last year.
The UK's frozen cod imports have been stable in recent years at around 79,000 tonnes, Globefish reported.

Beverage Market Deposit scheme all set for start Everything seems to be under control - Technical collection solution still limited to the discounters.
The drinks industry will look back on twelve months of extremely hard work at today's press conference when the company responsible for and coordinating the new deposit system announces the official start.
More than 210 companies are already taking part in the new system led by Deutsche Pfandsystem GmbH (DPG), which is expected to cover close on 90 per cent of all drinks packaging that can be recycled (in contrast to bottles that can be refilled), and "more are joining every day," says Bernd-Ulrich Sieberger, managing director at Deutsche Pfandsystem.
A database that allows retailers to see if their drinks suppliers are members of the DPG system became available in early April and is proving to be more than popular.
This is the only place that provides the guarantee that the retailers will get their deposits from the manufacturers.
Small importers, for instance, will have to pay EUR 1,000 plus another one-off fee for each new EAN barcode, while major bottlers will be paying EUR 14,000.
These also take act as deposit account managers.
Retailers will also act in this capacity for their own labels.
Further financing will come from the retailers and the packaging and reverse vending machine manufacturers.
The collection of packaging for which a deposit has to be paid will not be fully automated at the start.
The manual collection of the cartons and PET bottles has been tested extensively and works well.
The so-called "sack-reverse logistics" introduced by the convenience retailer Lekkerland where the contents of the sacks are counted by automatic machines installed at the recycling companies have been optimised at the lowest possible cost.
The reverse vending machines which the Aldi stores are introducing need at least 600 bottles or cartons a day to make them viable.
A Lebensmittel Zeitung survey showed that taking the packaging back this way will initially remain a solution limited to the discounters.
Rewe's spokesman Wolfram Schmuck has said that it is investing EUR 80 million in its Penny discounters for such machines.
The Tengelmann group declined to comment on the subject.
Observers have noticed that its discounter channel Plus has been minimising what's on its drinks shelves recently and taking anything that can be refilled off the menu.
It is now concentrating on the manual collection of the lightweight PET bottles.
The independent discounter Norma is sticking to manual collection for the present.
Managing director Armin Rehberg told Lebensmittel Zeitung that "the machines available today are not yet really suitable for the job and too expensive", although a few machines are being tested.
Wincor-Nixdorf machines will be in operation in stores belonging to Aldi Nord, Netto, Kaufland and many Edeka E-Centersas well as in Citti Märkte belonging to the BBB+R group as of Tuesday, 2nd May.
Jubilant Germans and beer-guzzling fans from around the globe have helped brewers like Krombacher, Holsten and Radeberger to shift huge volumes of beer in June after the biggest recorded increase in sales nationally in a year in May.
Joerg Schillinger, a spokesman for InBev, the parent company of Bremen-based Beck's, said the excitement surrounding Germany's unexpected success in the World Cup and relentless heat had stretched production capacity to the limit.
"We're laughing in one eye and crying out of the other at the moment", he said.
"It's very difficult.
We're getting trucks ready for dispatch like never before and doing everything in our power to deliver what people want - but it takes time to brew and deliver beer!" he said, adding that fresh beer can only be stockpiled for limited periods.
Moved to caution because of an uncommonly long winter that dented demand at the start of 2006, the German Beer Brewers' association has said it hopes the World Cup, which ends on Sunday, will provide enough momentum to lift sales this year.
"Just like the industry as a whole, we hope we'll finish the year with sales slightly in the black!" said Schillinger from InBev, which has a market share of some 11 % in Germany.
Birte Kleppien from the German Beer Brewers' association said while the industry had expected to do well from the World Cup, the wave of national euphoria that accompanied Germany's progress to the semi-finals had provided an unexpected boost.
And then there have been other things, too she said.
"For example we never expected the English to descend en masse on the breweries in Cologne and show a real liking for the local beer - even though it's served in small glasses."
Kleppien said she was hopeful the industry, which has an annual turnover of around 8.4 billion euros in Germany and has been estimated to directly or indirectly employ 250,000, would benefit from the beer revival for some time yet.
"If the weather's good, I think there's a good chance the mood will last a bit longer than the World Cup," she said.
Nonetheless, with beer sales having dipped by over 3 % to 106 million hectolitres in 2004 from 115.3 million in 1995, InBev's Schillinger said the industry still had much work to do.
"The brewing industry didn't do anything for its image for years," he said.
"A lot of young people see beer as a drink for old guys with beer bellies.

After a not so positive year 2005, the association is optimistic that the consumption will rise again despite price increases.
Already the first months give reason for optimism; the industry registered slight growth.
In the long run, the demographic development is expected to boost the spirits industry, since an increasingly older population would lead to higher spirits consumption.
Besides, growing markets like Asia and the US also offer chances to maximize spirits exports.
In 2005, exports climbed from 145 million bottles to 158 million, whereas imports declined from 355 to 344 million units, due to the drop in RTDs (Ready-to-Drinks).
Imports (mainly of international brands) accounted for 40 %, i.e. a considerable share of the total spirits market.
The Federal Association of the German Spirits Industry and Importers (BSI) calculated a per capita consumption of 5.7 litres, which is the lowest consumption ever.
Despite the recent price increases, the industry hopes to reach a level of 5.8 litres per head in 2006, the same level as in 2004.
Wilfried Mocken, President of BSI, did not make a secret of the fact that even after the first price increases during the last months, the industry had to react upon rising costs like the higher VAT rate.
Just like the per capita consumption, the total offer of spirits decreased as well.
The total amount of produced spirits and imports (exports already deducted) dropped by 36 million bottles (à 0.7 litres) down to 765 million units (excl. spirits mixed drinks).
Just about one quarter of the total volume of spirits is distributed outside the food retail trade - but sometimes at clearly higher prices, for example in the restaurant trade.
With 421 million bottles, the food retail trade realized a marginal sales increase of 0.3 % or 1.4 million bottles.
Taking RTD drinks into account, which registered severe losses, overall sales dropped by 2.6 %.
Beverages with high alcohol content represent almost half of the turnover with alcoholic beverages.
Mocken's conclusion:
Retail Market German business climate The business climate of the German food retail trade once again improved in March 2006, reported the Munich-based Ifo-Institut.
Moreover, the industry even realized an increase of the retail prices, claimed Ifo-Institut.
German shopping habits In the last year, the expenses for food and other non-durable consumer goods decreased by 2.7%.
An average German household spends EUR 3,204.00 per year for these goods.
This is the result of a study carried out by market research agency AC Nielsen, which analyzed the shopping habits of 8,400 Germans.
Once again, the importance of the large discounters Lidl, Aldi, Penny and Plus increased slightly over the last year.
This is particularly hard for smaller supermarkets which have about the same size as Aldi or Lidl, but cannot offer the same prices.
On the other hand, specialty shops and delicatessen dealers were able to maintain their position.
According to AC Nielsen, families with young children are Germany's main bargain hunters.
For young singles, it is most important to be able to easily run a household, thus they often choose convenience products like frozen food or ready-to-eat meals and frequently eat at snack bars.
Seniors are the most particular about choosing food products.
Singles in paradise Faster, easier, healthier and always delicious - this is the motto for success for convenience products.
In the race against the highest possible benefit, there don't seem to be any limits to the imagination of product developers.
The industry always has an eye on singles as a lucrative target group.
To the contrary:
Variety is the word of the day.
The industry offers a broad product range from classic lentil stew to Mediterranean creations to soups with Asian touch, and consumers gladly welcome them.
Market researchers have been reporting substantial growth for this wet food segment for years.
And the signs are also positive for the first quarter of 2006.
According to ACNielsen, the German food retail trade realized a turnover of EUR 64 million with stews, i.e. an increase of almost 5 % to the same year-earlier period.
Stews for calorie conscientious Weight Watchers Deutschland GmbH would like to have a slice of this cake.
Singles in paradise The company reports that their brand already accounts for a market share of almost 18 % in the segment of fresh meal solutions.
Campbell Germany is also on a steady growth track.
The No. 1 in the soup and stew segment reports that their 'Erasco' brand accounts for a market share of 51 %.
'One-serving-products' are currently very successful.
Not at last through several product launches in their 'Erasco 1 serving' range, they were able to expand their market share.
"With help of the new varieties, we extended our market share in the segment of 1-serving-products by 10.7 % (in terms of value) to 38.9 % in March 2006", says peter Schrage, Marketing Manager Eating with Campbells.
With focus on the steadily growing target group of singles, the Lübeck company plans to further enlarge their range of 400 g ring-pull-cans.
Besides, they also intend to distinguish themselves in the highly competitive market of instant soups - here, with focus on healthy nutrition.
The sub brand 'Erasco Heiße Tasse 85 % Gemüse' (Erasco Hot Cup 85 % vegetables), which was launched last fall, is to set new standards for balanced nutrition.
"With a vegetable content of 85 %, the product does not only reach the highest level of healthy ingredients in the instant soup segment, it also offers additional vitamins and is free of any taste enhancing substances", explains Jens Mielke, Marketing Manager Snacking.
Campbells is satisfied with their first results.
Six months after the introduction, distribution was at 52 %.
The market share reached nearly 7 % in March 2006.
Nestlé and Unilever are also tapping into the 'Wellness' trend.
Unilever offers a soup ("Knorr Gemüse satt" - "Knorr vegetables galore") with a vegetable content of 80%.
Being free of cholesterol, rich in vitamins and fibres are other benefits of the Knorr active range which include ready-to-eat meals and soups in a pouch.
These products contain one to two servings and aim at the target group of so-called 'situational single consumers'.
Maggi with healthy arguments Maggi (Nestlé) is well positioned with their 'feel-good' range, which offers the nutritional benefits of a high vitamin and a low fat content (0.9 %).
The company reports that the dry ready-to-eat meals (for two servings) launched in February 2005 as well as the soups launched a few months later were very successful.
After all, Nestlé is very satisfied with their figures for 'Maggi'.
"We realized an increase in turnover of 4.1 % in the dry food segment in 2005 (food retail trade without Aldi)", states Andreas Peters, CEO Marketing with Maggi.
With their 1-2 portion pouches, the company registered a marked growth of 17% in the dry food category.
Besides, the Asian segment is also doing very well:
With their noodle snacks 'Magic Asia', they realized an increase in turnover of 14 %.
Thus, fried noodles were the most popular prepared food in two-servings-pouches in 2005", said Peters.
Enough reasons to continue promoting this segment.
The launch of 'fried noodles chicken' is planned for June 2006.
Additional benefits The segment of convenience vegetables is also undergoing some changes and is on the move.
Bonduelle reports that their vegetable products in Tetra Pak realized an increase in turnover of more than 30 %.
They hope to repeat this growth with their recently launched 'tender vegetable range', which currently comprises four vegetable preparations with sauce in a 400 ml package including varieties like chilli-vegetable stew and puszta-vegetable stew.
Competitor Campbells, however, will soon follow.
The company plans to close a market gap through introduction of a line of canned products called 'Erasco vegetable & sauce' in July 2006.
The range will comprise four vegetable varieties in 400 or 800 gram packages.
"Some studies have shown that consumers of canned vegetables do not only eat vegetables, they often prepare a sauce to go with it", explains Martina Meyer, Product Manager Innovations with Campbells.
"The new range is to meet this need."
No matter if in a pouch, in a can or fresh - convenience needs to be easy to prepare and should guarantee a healthy nutrition.
Decision-makers of 'Steinhaus' realized this long ago.
The Remscheid company is offering a range called 'MyStyle', which mainly addresses female singles.
"According to our experience, wellness products are mainly bought in single portions by female consumers." explained Oliver Frielingsdorf, Marketing Manager with Steinhaus.
The filled pasta products benefit from a low fat content of less than 3 % and are enriched with vitamins and minerals.
But there is more to follow, since combinations of wellness and organic trends will continue to develop, expects Marketing Manager Frielingsdorf.
"I can very well imagine a classic beef roll with a low fat content out of organic production."
Product developers at Hilcona always bear the 'situational single consumer' in mind.
The company, whose fresh chilled pasta products account for a market share of 33 % in the traditional food retail trade (according to their own figures) currently distinguishes itself through quick and easy-to-prepare meals.
Marketing Manager Dirk Knollmann is full of confidence when looking at the sales figures of the first two months of their recently launched express pasta range - pre-cooked pasta specialties which can be prepared in a pan, microwave or water bath in only a few minutes.
Quick taste is also the idea behind 'Frische Pause' (fresh break), a pasta snack in a 250 g package which is ready to eat after two minutes in the microwave - an interesting alternative to the convenient curry sausage.
Quickness is also key in the rice segment.
The time factor is most important for the new products from Euryza, Müllers Mühle and Uncle Bens.
In March 2006, Euryza launched a rice product called 'reis-fit natural rice, eight minutes', the rice is cleaned but unhulled and special steam processing reduced the cooking time to eight minutes.
The 1-2-rice range is even faster.
The prepared products in a serving cup are ready after one minute in the microwave.
A concept which is well accepted by consumers, reveals Barbara Andrae, Group Product Manager with Euryza.
"In the promising prepared rice segment, we were able to expand our market share (in terms of value) to 15 %."
Competitor Masterfoods taps into the trend of quick cooking with its "Uncle Ben's Express Rice".
This line comprises nine varieties in 250 g pouches which can be consumed after cooking two minutes in the microwave.
The innovation from Müllers Mühle takes a bit longer: the parboiled quick rice needs 8 minutes.
"This is the shortest cooking time for a parboiled product on the German market", says a company spokesman.
Since the beginning of 2006, the Gelsenkirchen company increasingly focuses on balanced nutrition.
Product range and packaging have been improved accordingly, and marketing activities now follow the motto "Conscious eating with pleasure".
In line with this slogan, the packages now show all relevant nutritional information for raw and cooked rice.
This will simplify the dosage and preparation when on a rice diet.
Development of turnover in EUR 1,000

Inconvenience for the retail trade Fresh and ready-to-eat food products are the trend - but the retail trade is coping with difficulties, as these products are only convenient for the consumer.
Distributors find it inconvenient to maintain their product range, but a half-hearted attempt to offer convenience products has its consequences.
There once was a dream - clear and widely spread - of an excellent broad range of fresh and savoury convenience products which sell well and offer a high added value.
But the reality is different in the German food retail trade.
"The trade still has its difficulties with convenience", concludes Friedhelm Dornseifer, retailer and producer of fresh convenience products, at his own event "Cooked for you" in May 2006, which was organized in co-operation with the specialist of fresh pasta 'Hilcona'.
However, convenience is still growing, 2005 saw a 10% increase and a total turnover of EUR 800 million in Germany.
We urgently have to invest in new cooling equipment to be able to distinguish ourselves with fresh convenience products."
Moreover, it would be necessary to sensitize, inform and motivate their employees, and to draw customers' attention to the convenience segment.
This means that 'Preuss' supermarkets will increasingly introduce convenience products in their weekly handouts.
Despite all difficulties, Fred Otto, market researcher with ACNielsen, foresees best chances for the development of convenience products, as they still count among today's most important trends.
The quick and easy handling of convenience products does not only accommodate the needs of the working population, it also meets the requirements of the older population which often lives in single households and does not want to cook for itself.
In Austria, for example, the market is much more developed than here, but it was mainly driven by private label products.
Already in the nineties, Rewe Austria developed their own brand 'Chef Menue', which now holds a market share of 30 % and is supported by TV ads.
With their 350 convenience products, Rewe realizes a turnover of EUR 45 million.
After some years of growth, the fresh food segment is almost as large as the frozen food range, reports Thomas Steiner, responsible for "Chef Menue".
In one of his presentations, he talks about one decisive success factor - the correct term:
However, the term 'Frischkühlkost' is no solution for the German market:
Rewe Austria has registered the term as a trademark in all German-speaking countries.
In an interview with the "Welt am Sonntag" newspaper over the weekend David Wild, president of Wal-Mart Germany, said the firm is currently "examining unprofitable locations" and will close them if they are not deemed commercially viable in the long term.
He said some stores are "losing a lot of money" while others are performing excellently - facilitating the need for a specific area review.
This comes as the firm sold three underperforming supermarkets last week, in Dusseldorf-Reisholz, Sigmaringen and Muehldorf, leaving 85 hypermarkets open across the country.
Earlier this year Wal-Mart said it would plough € 30m into upgrading the remaining stores, but with the review underway this may now be postponed.
The US retailer's presence in Germany is now at an all-time low since entering the market in 1997.
For Wal-Mart International, higher than expected year-end German operating losses came as a disappointment to the company that has seen a shift in its European fortunes.
The weakening of the pound and euro added to the negative impact on sales, management said.
However, overall the international section saw a 22.9 per cent rise in 2006's first-quarter net sales to $17.3bn (€ 13.7bn), bolstered by three major acquisitions during the period, in Japan and Latin America.
Globally Wal-Mart is the leading food retailer with net sales of $312bn, employing 1.5m workers in 15 countries.

Due to be presented at a workshop in Brussels tomorrow, the report to the European Commission's Directorate-General for Research examines the patterns and trends of consumer response to biotechnology in Europe.
The Eurobarometer report, which is the sixth in a series of surveys conducted since 1991, reveals that although Europeans generally support the use of medical and industrial biotechnology, their overall feeling on genetically modified (GM) food is that it should not be encouraged.
"GM food is widely seen as not being useful, as morally unacceptable and as a risk for society," said the report.
Countries with the highest level of acceptance for GM foods include Malta, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Spain, Belgium and Portugal.
According to the survey, there are mixed opinions on the acceptability of buying GM food, with the most persuasive reasons relating to health, the reduction of pesticide residues and environmental impacts.
Whether GM food is approved by the relevant authorities or is cheaper remain unconvincing, said the report.
The controversial debate surrounding the use of genetically modified organisms in food took a step forward in February when a landmark WTO decision ruled that the EU and six member states broke trade rules by barring entry to GM crops and foods.
By agreeing with the United States, Argentina and Canada that an effective moratorium on GM imports between June 1999 and August 2003 had been put in place, the ruling effectively opened up the European market to GM food.
Consumer choice has now become the ideal that both the supporting and the opposing camps claim to hold.
Anti-GM campaigners argue that GM crops will cause widespread contamination, leaving consumers with no GM-free choice at all.
Pro-GM forces on the other hand argue that consumers must be given the choice, and that the WTO ruling backs this up.
According to the new report, "the introduction of the new regulations on the commercialisation of GM crops and the labelling of GM food appear to have done little to allay the European public's anxieties about agri-food biotechnology.

EU meat production In 2005, the 25 EU member states produced a total of 44.9 million tons of meat or 0.3 % less than in 2004.
The EU meat consumption amounted to 42.7 million tons, i.e. 100,000 tons more than in 2004, analyzed the Center for Market and Price Reporting (ZMP).
The self supply rate remained unchanged at 103 % in 2005.
EU cheese market The EU cheese market continues to grow.
In 2005, both production and consumption increased significantly; the Center for Market and Price Reporting (ZMP) expects further growth for 2006.
The 25 EU member states produced an estimated amount of 8.8 million tons of cheese, 115,000 tons more than in 2004.
They set a new standard for genuine wine in contrast to the constantly widespread "artificial wine".
Grapes were cultivated organically and biodynamically in a long-term trial by the Washington State University.
The trial showed that the biodynamic wine had an ideal balance of extract, fruit, acid, alcohol and tannin.
Six winegrowers in Austria are currently certified to Demeter guidelines.

We feed the World On 27 April, the documentary film "We Feed the World" was shown in cinemas all over Germany.
The Austrian producer Erwin Wagenhofer went in search of our food and the people who produce it in their places of work: in the greenhouse landscape of Andalusia, on the fishing boats of Bretagne and in the office of the Chief Executive of Nestlé.
The central theme is an interview with Jean Ziegler, the UN official with special responsibility for reporting on the human right to food.
The film - in Austria it is already the most successful documentary for decades - poses key questions on consumer behaviour and the responsibility of the individual.
The book accompanying the film (We Feed the World.
What Food Really Costs Us) will be published shortly by Orange press. www.we-feed-the-world.at Source:
These changes were brought about by the agreement between the European Union and Switzerland concerning the trade with agricultural products, the so-called agricultural agreement of June 21, 1999 which finally came into force on June 1, 2002.
The aim was to facilitate the market entry on both sides through abolition and reduction of customs duties on selected products.
After a transition period of five years, the agreement foresees a complete liberalisation of the cheese trade.
"The agreement facilitates the agricultural trade through reduction or abolition of non-tariff trade barriers, i.e. certain technical regulations concerning veterinary medicine, plant protection, organic agriculture and quality norms for fruits and vegetables etc. will be mutually accepted.
The indications of origin for wines and spirits are equally protected; other sectors, especially the cheese sector, can be included later on", summarizes the official notification of the Swiss government.
Now another proposal has been brought forward: free trade with the EU, which was presented in the Federal Council in mid February.
All political parties were surprised and their reactions were strong.
Whereas some spoke of a 'death blow against Swiss agriculture', others saw this as 'the only possibility to survive'.
It is beyond any doubt that the agricultural sector, which realizes an annual income of CHF 3 million, will face drastic cuts.
Taking the EU free trade zone as an example, the agricultural information agency talks about a 50%-reduction of the income.
Under the motto 'Agricultural Policy 2011" other models are discussed to increase the competitiveness of the Swiss agriculture through reduction of market support, abolition of export subsidies and increase of direct payments.
These models also talk about severe losses for the farmers: their turnover is to decline by CHF 500 million.
Another item on the agenda is negotiations with the WTO which plans a worldwide liberalisation of the agricultural trade.
No matter what the results of the negotiations might be - a thorough structural change of the agricultural sector is merely a matter of time.
The processing industry has long been waiting for this.
High prices for raw materials and tariff barriers on top of high incidental costs did nothing to improve Swiss competition.
On the other hand, Swiss products are already well represented on the international market.
"Switzerland still stands for high prices", says Lorence Weiss of baking material manufacturer 'Jowa', "but if we specialise consequently and in a professional way, we can well be competitive on a European level".
Export figures show how well Swiss companies are represented abroad; exports increased overall in the last year and account for more than 50 % of the turnover.
This is true for brand producers of cheese and confectionery as well as for private labels, which are typical of processed foods.
It is time to orientate towards a larger internationalism.
The Swiss price system finally started to sway due to the market entry of large foreign retailers who offered their products at lower prices and purchased more goods from abroad than Migros or Coop.
But it seems that "Swiss companies are still at the beginning of a large fight for quality and price-conscientious customers", says Prof Dr Thomas Bogner from Lörrach, who studied the Swiss trade environment intensively.
However, the first effects on prices are already visible.
No. 3 in Europe Switzerland remains one of the ten most competitive countries of the world.
On the list of the Lausanne Institute for Management Development (IMD), Switzerland maintained last year's position, ranking 8, reported Swissinfo.
The United States stayed on the top of the list.
At the same time, Switzerland is among the top three European countries, following Island (ranking 4th on the global list) and Denmark (ranking 5th).
The study, which has been conducted since 1989, examines 61 countries and regions and their position in the international market based on a catalogue of 312 criteria.
One of them is the "work environment" of companies in each country.
The most important factors are hard facts like economic situation, economic and political efficiency and infrastructure, but manager surveys are also taken into account.
With their finance system and their excellent credit rating, Switzerland ranked first in two different categories.
The strength of the Swiss economy is also reflected in Swiss investments abroad: here, Switzerland ranks 4th.
Switzerland to open up to the EU market At last week's annual press conference of Weko, the Swiss Commission of Competition, Weko President Prof Walter Stoffel called for an uncompromising market opening towards the European Union.
Prof Stoffel proposed to apply the Cassis-de-Dijon principle in the trade with EU member states.
This means that all products which can freely circulate throughout the European market could also be freely traded in Switzerland.
The Swiss government is preparing a market opening to improve the competitiveness of the Swiss market.
However, some press releases report that a number of Federal Offices applied for more than 100 exceptions to a general free circulation of goods in order to hold on to divergent national regulations which control, among others, the access to dangerous chemicals or the labelling of GMOs.
Slight drop of organic consumption in Switzerland The number of organic farms declined slightly in 2005 for the first time in the 25-year history of Bio Suisse.
The structural change in agriculture does not even stop for organic.
The overall organic market did hold its ground at a high level, however - despite the raw headwind from the cut-price shelves.
Turnover steadied at 1.183 billion CHF (752 million EUR), slightly less than 0.5 % below the previous year, but the dynamic differed in the individual submarkets.
Sales of organic fruit, organic vegetables and organic eggs grew strongly, but organic meat and organic milk slowed.
The Swiss remain world champions with per head spending of 160 CHF (101 EUR) on organic products.
6,114 farms in Switzerland - some 11 % of all farms - currently work according to the Bio Suisse guidelines. www.biosuisse.ch Source:
Switzerland Swiss companies:
MIGROS Migros is a "state within a state".
The orange-coloured trade giant is located in Zuerich and has 10 affiliated cooperatives.
The Swiss market leader is highly diversified.
Migros' empire realizes a total turnover of CHF 20.3 billion; supermarkets, consumer markets as well as department stores, specialty shops, golf courts, travel agents, a bank and various industrial companies also belong to this group.
Migros reinforced its position in the last year with a slight increase in turnover of 0.4 %.
Price decreases and a reorganisation of the Globus Group contribute to this result.
Migros was founded in the mid-twenties by Gottlieb Duttweiler who started to supply food products with five Ford vans.
He, who committed himself to ethic principles, greatly characterized the company.

Between 1992 and 2002, the share of consumers who regularly ate meat and meat products declined from 43 to 36 %.
On the other hand, the share of consumers eating fish at least once a week increased in every age group - from 60 % to 66 % for the 45 to 54 year-olds.
Whereas the older Swiss generation eats healthier than in 1992, the younger generation lives a less healthy life.
About one third is not at all health conscious when it comes to nutrition - the share has been stable since 1992.
The main reason to renounce on healthy eating is the high cost of healthy foods (18% of all answers).
Further reasons for unhealthy eating were eating habits and constraints of everyday-life (17%), preference for good hearty food (16%) and the high amount of time required for shopping and preparing meals (12%).
Especially young people eat in snack bars and on the street: 54 % of the 15 to 24 year-olds eats at a fast food restaurant at least once a week.
The study of Swiss eating habits was carried out in 1992, 1997 and 2002.
For the most recent study, 19,700 persons were selected by random sample and asked for their health and life situation.

ISM - Visitor numbers up with a strong turnout from abroad The 37th International Sweets and Biscuits Fair (ISM) was a great success.
In view of the large number of high-ranking visitors, the exhibiting companies are very optimistic and expecting good post-fair business.
At 6o%, the share of visitors from outside Germany increased once again.
The percentage of trade visitors from Germany remained stable, with the same high level of decision-making authority in evidence as in previous years.
With a focus on themes including "premium"," wellness and fitness" and "organic products" many of the suppliers presented product ideas and concepts in line with the latest trends.
A visit to the fair by Horst Seehofer, Germany's Federal Minister of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture, on the first day of the fair also underlined the importance of the German and international confectionery industry.
According to Wolfgang Kranz, Executive Vice President of Koelnmesse, the 37th ISM was another key event for the worldwide trade in confectionery products and snack items.
"Together with our partners in the sector, we precisely tailored the fair's concept to meet the needs of the suppliers and buyers," he stated.
"That's paid off for everyone involved.
The suppliers gained direct access to all of their relevant customers in the global confectionery trade."
Increasing number of visitors from Eastern Europe This year, the buyers in attendance once again came from around 150 countries.
As in past years, EU countries were particularly well represented.
For the 1,609 suppliers from 71 countries, ISM was a very promising start to 2007.
Representatives of these companies praised the decision-making power of the contacts they made at the fair.
"Every discussion pays off at ISM, and every contact is important," said one exhibitor.
A number of suppliers closed major deals during the event.
This year, for the first time, ISM benefited from the completed modernisation of the Cologne exhibition centre.
The new Entrance South, the linking function of the centrally located open-air Piazza, and the Entrances East and West ensured an even flow of visitors in all the halls.
Exhibitors and visitors alike once again had high praise for the organisation of ISM.
"Wellness and fitness" theme evident in every product segment Many concepts for confectionery and snack items focus on the relationship between natural raw ingredients, a great taste and a sense of well-being.
With an emphasis on cutting sugar and fat, a greater use of natural aromas and ingredients, and authentic ingredients, the "wellness and fitness" theme was evident in every product segment, especially chocolate products.
ISM - Visitor numbers up with a strong turnout from abroad The sector is thus responding to the current discussions regarding fundamental nutritional questions that are being initiated by politicians and consumer protection agencies.
With new recipes and innovative products, the producers are satisfying demands regarding a balanced diet and the guilt-free enjoyment of treats.
Overall, there is a clear trend towards high quality, and this is being addressed by suppliers of premium products in particular.
These companies are offering sophisticated confectionery concepts that are a delight for the taste buds and setting new standards with selected ingredients and exotic, original creations.
Organic products in the confectionery and snack sector are also in strong demand, and growing numbers of brand-name suppliers are responding to the consumers' wishes.
The spectrum of products ranges from chocolates to sugar confectionery and biscuits to snack items made with certified organic ingredients.
Trends:
At SM it was clear to see that the suppliers in every segment, from chocolate and sugar confectionery to sweet baked goods and savoury snacks, have drawn a lesson from the ongoing public discussion about nutritional habits and are now pro-actively marketing their products accordingly.
Trends such as wellness and fitness, premium products and organic foods being not only adapted, but also celebrated with specific advantages drawn from the enormous range of sweet indulgences.
The major highlights consumers can look forward to this summer include pure fruit, more original chocolate products with a high cocoa content, and functional sweets, lollipops and chewing gum in new guises.
Rooibos, Pu-erh tea, green tea, ginger, lemon grass, sea buckthorn and Asia spice have become commonplace in "active" chocolates and marzipan creations.
Now that chilli, red and green pepper, sea salt and Himalayan salt have be come more "mainstream" chocolate additives, the top chocolatiers like German company Coppeneur are experimenting with ylang-ylang, noni, lassi, wasabi and algae, as well as with incense and, of course, rose essences.
Many suppliers are offering chocolate bars with 100% cocoa content, and the connoisseurs now talk of cocoa and cultivation regions (such as Esmeraldas, Los Rios and Manabi in Ecuador, Santander in Colombia, and areas of Java, Madagascar and Ghana) just as knowledgeably and enthusiastically as wine lovers do about types of grapes, chateaux and vineyards.
More and more sugar-free or "light" variants on the market The companies are now mentioning numerous scientific studies and health-promoting elements in their marketing activities, according to which cocoa, for example, can increase longevity.
Products include "IQ" chocolate which demonstrably increases powers of concentration, and chocolate that strengthens the immune system.
ISM - Visitor numbers up with a strong turnout from abroad At ISM 2007 in Cologne, it was evident that the confectionery industry is taking wellness and well-being seriously.
It is offering a wealth of concepts for a whole variety of situations, such as ribbed mints for tongue care, IQ mints for enhancing mental performance, and a lollipop with the calming herbs lemon balm and lime blossom, which is recommended to smokers in particular, in a form resembling a pack of cigarettes.
When it comes to sweets, chews, fruit gums and similar products, more and more manufacturers are putting sugar-free variants on the market.
What is common in the case of bonbons could soon define the market for other products, too.
"Light" variants of chocolate bars are becoming increasingly popular in Spain, although this tendency is not yet visible in Germany.
Initial projects with reduced-sugar bars have been well received, however.
One development stands out across all the segments: an increased use of fruit.
It is also impossible to overlook the abundance of summer chocolates with mango, passion fruit, peach, green apple, figs, various berries, and many other types of fruit.
The big stars of this year, however, are cherries.
From cherry stracciatella in fine marzipan, to an added ingredient in marshmallow confection (a technological masterpiece) or in combination with light yoghurt biscuits, cherries are making a major comeback.
In addition, many retro items are rapidly becoming big hits with consumers.
These include "cat's tongue" chocolates and, for children, the rectangular lolly chews with a raspberry and milk flavour.
Children's items with new license themes The manufacturers of children's items are continuing to expand their set of licenses.
The classics from Disney, as well as Barbie, Pokémon and also Sponge-Bob SquarePants, are being joined this year especially by Hello Kitty.
One exhibitor at ISM generated a real swell of interest by making dinosaur figures hatch out of an egg and grow.
In the coming months, a sense of fun will be provided by turtle and wrestling themes with matching accessories, like tattoos, stickers and surprise eggs.
Purism and a commitment to raw ingredients are major factors in the segment for sweet baked goods, with peanuts set to play a leading role this year.
Many organic items were on display in this section of ISM, in several cases as organic variants of standard baked goods.
"Organic foods are basics, not luxuries" According to one supplier of salty snacks, "organic foods are basics, not luxuries."
The snack segment is offering a wide variety of light versions and new items, such as potato-like fruits from Asia, prawns and above all rice crackers in all shapes and colours.
Whereas a trend towards downsizing has been apparent in recent years (still noticeable in Cologne in the form of 40g and 50g mini-bars, sticks, etc.), large multi-packs and extra-large bars are once again gaining in popularity.
In the case of biscuits, there are wonderful cookies from Australia, packaged in designer boxes and ideal for sharing with friends.
ISM - Visitor numbers up with a strong turnout from abroad And with the fantastic 2006 World Cup still a recent memory, sport remains an important theme for the confectionery sector.
Top athletes like Anni Friesinger, the World Cup-winning German women's team, and football stars Lukas Podolski and Torsten Frings will give testimonials that promote the enjoyment of sport for people of all ages, and family-friendly dental care.
There will be no lack of variety in this confectionery year - and that's certainly something to look forward to.
The 38th ISM will take place from 27th to 30th January 2008.
ProSweets Cologne established in the trade fair market The exhibitors and visitors at ProSweets Cologne agreed that in its second year the trade fair has become firmly established as an important platform for suppliers to the confectionery industry.
From 29th January to 1st February 2007, around 10,700 trade visitors from 132 countries viewed the products exhibited by 289 suppliers from 26 countries.
ProSweets Cologne focused on ingredients, confectionery packaging and packaging technology, machinery and systems for the confectionery industry, food safety and quality management.
Within one year, the ProSweets Cologne fair has developed extremely well," states Wolf gang Kranz, Executive Vice President of Koelnmesse GmbH.
"We're right on course with the trade fair."
In combination, ProSweets Cologne and the International Sweets and Biscuits Fair (ISM) present the entire value chain for the confectionery industry, from single ingredients and technology to the product ready for sale.
The number of exhibitors at ProSweets Cologne totalled 289 from 26 countries, an increase of more than 20% compared to 2006 (229 suppliers from 27 countries).
In all, 150 of the suppliers came from outside Germany, accounting for 52% of the exhibitors (2006: 48%).
Around 10,700 visitors (2006: 7,862) from 132 countries (2006: 52) registered for ProSweets Cologne, with 61% (2006: 59%) or approximately 6,500 visitors (2006: 4,607) coming from abroad.
The trade visitors from Germany and the EU were joined by a large number from Eastern Europe and the Middle East.
Positive statements of exhibitors and visitors The positive development of ProSweets Cologne was reflected in exhibitors' statements regarding the number and decision-making authority of the visitors.
In almost every segment, the exhibitors reported that they were highly satisfied and that they would be interested in returning for the next Pro-Sweets Cologne in 2009.
"Our participation paid off right from the first day of the fair," said one manufacturer of confectionery machinery.
ProSweets Cologne established in the trade fair market "The visitor quality was excellent," reported the spokesperson of an ingredients supplier company.
The high decision-making authority of the visitors is confirmed by the initial results of the representative trade visitor survey, according to which almost 70% had sole or shared responsibility in making purchasing and procurement decisions.
Around 74% of the visitors said they were satisfied or very satisfied with the products on display, and approximately 77% were satisfied or very satisfied with the degree to which they achieved their trade fair goals.
Almost 70% of the survey respondents stated that they would definitely or very probably return for the next ProSweets Cologne in 2009.
ProSweets Cologne covered a wide range of product groups.
This year's fair attracted not only major manufacturers of systems for producing chocolate and biscuits, but also a large number of companies that manufacture machines for sugar confectionery and snack items.
Growth was highest in the segment of packaging machinery and packaging materials.
A clear product trend in this field was evident at ProSweets Cologne.
High-quality matte surfaces are increasingly being used for foil packaging and tins, while glossy packaging is becoming less popular.
At ProSweets Cologne, the suppliers of machines and systems concentrated on presenting enhanced products.
In terms of ingredients, there was an amazing spectrum of many new flavours and colours.
The sector is intensively engaged in implementing the planned new EU regulations.
Many producers, particularly of hard caramels, are moving quickly to adapt to the changing legal requirements by increasingly using pure natural products.
They are developing new natural colours and aromas.
At the same time, the wellness trend continues unabated, so there is high demand for raw ingredients and additives that provide added health benefits.
The supporting programme of Pro-Sweets Cologne offered a range of fresh features that were of great interest to visitors.
One of these was the "Nut Special" show, a widely renowned international special show dedicated to the use of nuts in the confectionery supplier industry.
Here, a number of international associations and group organisations from Bolivia, California and Turkey provided an overview of the nuts from their countries and their particular characteristics.
The theme of the German Agricultural Society (DLG) presentation was ingredients, particularly nuts, almonds and pistachios.
The four conceptual sponsors also contributed high-profile presentations to the fair's presentation programme.
In addition, the packaging agency Berndt & Partner Packaging Creality offered a presentation entitled "Multi-sensory Packaging-Trends & Visions".
ProSweets Cologne is organised by Koelnmesse, and its conceptual sponsors are the Association of the German Confectionery Industry (BDSI), Sweets Global Network (SG), the German Agricultural Society (DLG) and the Central College of the German Confectionery Industry (ZDS).
The next ProSweets Cologne will again be held in close connection with the International Sweets and Biscuits Fair (ISM) in Cologne in February 2009.
Prior to this event, the international confectionery sector will be gathering at International Sweet & SnackTec China in Shanghai, which will be making its debut from 5th to 7th September 2007, in parallel to the 4th Sweets China.
Sweets and Confectionery Market
Clear upswing in imports and exports During the first nine months of 2006 there was a clear upswing in German confectionery imports and exports.
According to the BDSI, imports rose 10.8% in volume up to 654,175 tonnes worth €1.734 billion (bn), an increase of 6.6%.
Confectionery exports were up 7.2% on the previous year in volume, to total 896,759 tons worth €2.439 bn, up by 6.9%.
Exports of chocolate confectionery- the most important segment-grew at above market average rates of 15.3% in volume (229,840 tons) and of 15.2% in value (€881.2 m).
The German exporters of snacks benefited most from the boom generated by the fascinating 2006 World Cup, hosted by Germany.
Exports of sugar confectionery increased between January and September by 4.0% in volume (120,531 tons) and by 5.3% in value (€311 m).
Exports of fine pastries, in contrast, dipped by 6.5% down to 177,477 tonnes, which are worth €488.7 m (-5.8%).
Double digit growth in imports of snacks The increase in demand for snacks also impacted on imports, which rose by 15.9% in volume to 59,826 tonnes worth €149.8 m - a rise of only 2.9%.
In terms of percentages, growth in imports of chocolate confectionery (128,958 tons, €474.1 m), fine pastries (130,784 tons, €316.3 m) and sugar confectionery (88,635 tons, €255.7 m) was all single digit.
Imports of cocoa and chocolate semi-finished articles rose by 30.4% in volume up to 181,746 tons worth €390.6 m (+14.0%).
The Netherlands strengthens leading position 574,420 tons of confectionery from the EU (+8.4%) worth €1.496 bn (+5.4%) was imported by Germany.
Imports from the Netherlands-the biggest exporter to Germany- rose 11.2% in value up to €487.9 m.
Belgian imports were up by 1.5% to €301.6 m.
Rapid growth was also confirmed for imports from Ireland (+160.0%), Slovenia (+72.7%), Poland (+35.8%) and Portugal (+34.2%).
Switzerland is the biggest supplier by far among the third countries and dispatched confectionery worth €102.2 m (+9.7%) to Germany.
Imports from Turkey amounted to €27.9 m (+11.4%), while imports from the US slid by 18.1% to €19.2 m.
Chocolate and sugar confectionery revenues were down 6.1% on the previous year to €5.736 bn.
Fine pastries sales (including salty and savoury varieties) increased slightly by 1.1%, up to €2.598 bn.
According to the BDSI these figures also take the trading data of manufacturing companies into account.
Sweets Global Network 2/2007
Sugar-frees to take the offensive Less fat and sugar - the sweets and confectionery industry is facing the obesity discussion and the looming advertising ban.
With new initiatives and innovations, the industry tries to take the wind out of critics' sails.
The International Trade Fair for Sweets and Confectionery (ISM) in Cologne made it clear that the health and wellness wave has caught the sweets and confectionery industry.
The focus was on sugar-free and fat reduced products, which meet customers' demand for balanced nutrition and indulgence without bad conscience.
This does not come as a surprise, since sweets have never been so harshly criticized than today.
Growing problem of obesity It is a fact that more than 200 million adults and 14 million kids in Europe are overweight or obese.
Hence, it is understandable that in light of these figures, EU politicians want to send a message.
Whether a ban on advertising for confectionery will cause children to eat less chocolate and sweets is, however, highly debatable.
"A ban on advertising will not solve the problem", says Philippe Metzger, CEO of Masterfoods.
However, the share of obese children is as high as in any other Canadian province, where there is no such ban.
This indicates that there is no connection between confectionery advertising and obesity.
The best example is the country with the highest per-capita consumption of chocolate in Europe:
Switzerland. Every Swiss consumes an average of 11 kg of chocolate per year.
However, the share of obese people in relation to the total Swiss population is lower than in any other country in Europe.
The Greeks eat an average of only 3 kg of chocolate per year, but there is no other country in Europe with a higher percentage of obese people.
Steps towards a better image Despite the all-clear, the industry is actively promoting healthy nutrition.
Already three years ago, leading manufacturers (e.g. Masterfoods, Nestlé, Ferrero, Kraft Foods, Intersnack and Katjes) have joined the platform 'Peb' (Initiative Platform Nutrition and Exercise).
The first result of this platform is 'Peb & Pebber', an animated puppet cartoon to motivate kids to exercise more and eat healthier.
Some manufacturers even have gone a step further.
Masterfoods, for example, no longer offers snack bars with more than 300 cal.
They also changed the product recipes and reduced the content of trans fatty acids by 90% to less than 0.5 grams per serving.
Moreover, product developers are fiercely working on a way to improve the share of health-beneficent flavonoids in Masterfoods' products.
Their commitment to indicate not only the calorie content but also its percentage share of the recommended daily intake is groundbreaking.
Besides, Masterfoods does not show advertisements addressed to under twelve-year-olds in Germany.
Other sweets manufacturers are working on similar measures.
Rundschau für den Lebensmittelhandel 03/07
Decline in confectionery sales The BDSI confirmed a decline in confectionery sales during the first three quarters of 2006 down to €8.334 bn.
The Association of the German Confectionery Industry (BDSI) predicts a rise in snack food prices this year as costly raw materials in short supply left manufacturers struggling and resulted in minimal market growth of 1.3%.
Last year, a very hot July followed by a wet August contributed to a disappointing potato yield, only a small percentage of which were suitable for crisp production.
The BDSI said:
"With the prices of potatoes, wheat and corn having increased by about a third, the sector expects prices of snack items to rise significantly this year."
The price of wheat rose by around a third last year - upping the cost of flour - while glucose also climbed by more than 30%.
The sector also felt the effects of rising prices of oils, fats and packaging materials.
In conjunction with the climbing costs involved in biscuit production, demand diminished due to a number of factors.
Snack sales did not benefit from the expected World Cup surge as the hot weather drove football fans outdoors where they consumed less than they normally would watching matches at home.
The unseasonably warm weather turned consumers off bakery items and consequently no growth occurred in the biscuit sector in 2006.
Around 100 German biscuit makers noted a lack of growth in production or exports.
Estimates from the BDSI suggest there was no change from 2005's 711,000 tonnes biscuit production volume and no growth in production value from around €2.18 billion.

Chilled Food Market
Chilled food sector shows strong growth potential Major opportunities exist for the European chilled prepared foods market to build on strong value-added sales, according to a new report.
Leatherhead Food International's new analysis of the sector suggests that chilled prepared foods are ideally situated to take advantage of trends such as healthy eating.
Products such as prepared salads and fresh pasta are frequently marketed on a health platform, whilst healthy varieties are a mainstay within sectors such as ready meals, prepared sandwiches and chilled soups.
"Consumer dietary concerns have also led to the emergence of more products made with fewer artificial additives, as well as reduced levels of fat, salt or calories," said the report.
"The main driver of the market remains convenience, coupled with the perception that chilled foods are often of a higher quality than their frozen equivalents."
The Leatherhead report attempts to identify the market size for chilled foods by sub-sector and country, and compares and contrasts the market for chilled foods with the equivalent markets for frozen and/or ambient foods.
The report highlights high household penetration of both microwave ovens and refrigerators, along with the trend towards convenience foods and the decline of formal mealtimes, as major factors for this.
Indeed, the majority of chilled prepared foods sold in the UK are own-label.
France represents Western Europe's other major market for chilled prepared foods, with value sales worth around €2.7bn in 2005.
Leatherhead claims that many French consumers prefer to buy main foodstuffs fresh, from more traditional outlets as well as supermarkets, which is a main factor behind the sizeable market value.
In contrast, chilled prepared foods trail their frozen equivalents in many sectors of the German market.
As a result, sales of chilled pizza, ready meals, soups and bakery items are very small in Germany, a situation due in part to the strong position enjoyed by discount retailers such as Aldi.
Italy's relatively high market value of more than €1.29bn can be attributed to the popularity of chilled pasta products, a sector that accounts for over 40% of sales.
In Mediterranean countries such as Italy and Spain, sales of chilled prepared foods have traditionally been hampered by the low penetration of convenience foods and the consumer perception that freshly prepared alternatives are both healthier and of a higher quality.
Another point to note is that the total European market for chilled prepared foods is very fragmented, encompassing both a wide variety of products and a large number of suppliers.
"Value growth has also been boosted by the fact that many chilled prepared foods command high prices, especially in comparison with frozen or ambient alternatives.
The fact that some chilled foods can be eaten immediately has also taken the category into the snacking arena, especially within sectors such as coated foods and savoury bakery items."
Coupled with the continued trend towards healthier food, the short-term future of the sector therefore looks positive.
This is the third edition of Leatherhead's European chilled prepared foods report.
The previous edition was published in July 2003.

Beef Market
However, a shortage is very unlikely.
The leading meat importers in Germany, most of them located in Hamburg, have already adapted to the changing market and have expanded their traditionally close relationships to South American suppliers.
Following are some examples of the import market to illustrate this:
With the takeover of the Paulsen Group 'Peter Paulsen Import-Export GmbH & Co.
KG' in January 2005, Heristo AG has become one of the leading importers of beef from overseas.
Although Paulsen Group also trades in other meat varieties and agricultural products, beef from Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay still amounts for the lion's share of the group turnover with € 290 million.
The trade with poultry and poultry products from Asian, South American and Eastern European countries is mainly realized with the subsidiary 'Franke & Paulsen GmbH'.
Wolfgang Kant estimates the annual volume to reach some 76,500 tons.
In 2005, 'Heristo AG' reached a turnover of €1.2 billion (incl. the turnover of 'Paulsen GmbH').
While 'Peter Paulsen' mainly trades in fresh and frozen meat parts, Heristo can now offer value-added products for the catering and food industry through 'Steakmaster GmbH', a company which was taken over at the beginning of 2006 (turnover: €40 million).
The growing diversification of the product range as a reaction to customers' demand is also visible with 'Rari GmbH', Hamburg.
The company, which has been part of the British 'Angliss Group' since 2002, has its roots in the slaughter and processing business, but has also been importing mostly frozen prime cuts since 1983.
Since then, the company has seen an enormous development:
General Manager Hans-Ullrich Goebel explains that last year, Rari GmbH and its 80 employees realized a turnover of €110 million, compared to only €30 million in 1995.
Taking the two subsidiaries into account, they realized a volume of €130 million; the total turnover of the Angliss Group with its 30 companies reached about US$ 1 billion in 2006.
Of the total of 18,000 tons which are sold by Rari every year, 900 tons are fresh beef, mainly from Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.
Some €35 million is realized with fish and seafood from Asian and South American countries: 100 tons of trout are purchased from Chile every year, game and poultry account for €20 million.
The majority of Rari's customers are wholesalers in German-speaking countries.
Goebel's aim is a stronger focus on organized retail trade and the processing industry, including the development of convenience products and finished goods.
Therefore, Rari's major advantage over its competitors is the broad product variety, explains General Manager Goebel.
One of the first to start importing meat from South America was 'Peter Mattfeld & Sohn GmbH'.
The company was founded in 1950 and has been importing goods from Argentina since 1970 and from New Zealand since the 1980.
Additionally, they purchase poultry from Brazil and Thailand.
According to Kay Becker of 'Mattfeld & Sohn', the company realizes an annual turnover of 3,000 and 3,500 tons, of which 60% are destined for the catering industry and its wholesalers, while 40% are sold to the food retail trade and C&C markets.
In the medium term, the company expects an increase in turnover of currently €70 to €100 million, partly due to their broad product range which will soon be enlarged even further by convenience products.
Becker forecasts that their beef imports alone will grow by 50%.
A comparably young company is 'Global Meat Suppliers GmbH & Co.
KG' (GMS) in Hamburg.
After their registration in November 2006 they expect to import fresh beef worth €12 million in the current year.
The company has subsidiaries in Buenos Aires, Saint Petersburg as well as an office in Brazil, through which they already import (products for transit and) frozen meat worth €70 million.
The majority of the shares are owned by co-partner and CEO Jan M. Schnoor and financial investors from Uruguay.
"Our aim is to create a number of unique beef brands for the EU with a strong emphasis on premium quality", explains Schnoor.
In the medium term, GMS plans to offer pre-packed portions.
To Schnoor, the transparency of the supply chain is their competitive advantage.
Customers will be able to trace and monitor the product at any time, from the selection of the animal via shipping to transportation.
Their main customers for certified Angus meat from Argentina are wholesalers, and the hotel, restaurant and catering trade, who have promised to offer quality meat to their guests.
There are good reasons why Argentina, Brazil and - to a certain degree - also Uruguay qualify as suppliers of high quality beef:
The Hilton Quota was allocated accordingly: 28,000 tons to Argentina, 6,300 tons to Uruguay and 5,000 tons to Brazil.
The demand for beef exported under the Hilton Quota, which is reserved for prime cuts of fresh beef, is immense:
Of the total volume of 69,000 tons which can be imported into the EU under the Hilton Quota (which has not been raised with the enlargement of the EU), some two thirds are destined for the German market (Note:
About 10,000 tons are allocated to the US and Canada - which was never used up).

US and Argentinean beef coop US Meat company 'Tyson Food' is cooperating with Argentina's leading agricultural company 'Cresud' to establish an integrated beef production in South America.
The joint venture is expected to generate US$ 30 to 35 million in 2007.
For Tyson, the project is an opportunity to gain a foothold on the European market for high quality beef.

Fish and Seafood Market
Fish a clients' magnet German consumers are buying more fish and of increasingly higher quality.
In 2006, the sales volume (in terms of value) increased by 8%, accounting for € 1.2 billion in the first half of 2006.
Preliminary figures of the Fish Information Centre (FIZ) show that per-capita-consumption rose from 14.7 kg (caught weight) in 2005 to 15.8 kg in 2006.
"Fish has become a magnet for customers", resumes Dr Michael Keller, General Manager of FIZ.
First estimates of FIZ confirm that consumers spend more money for fish.
While half of the increase in turnover is due to higher costs for raw materials and logistics, the other half is due to an increase in consumption of higher-priced fresh fish varieties, comments Keller.
Besides, he is sceptical of current warnings that herring and tuna were overfished.
To him, there would be enough young herring, and the yellow fin tuna (which is consumed in Germany) to be fished sustainably.
However, international agreements would be appropriate for such tuna varieties which are mainly used for sushi in Asia.

Fish consumption reached a record high in 2006.
The fastest growing sector in the food production is aquaculture.
For three consecutive years, German per-capita consumption of fish and seafood increased by another kilogram to 15.7 kg in 2006.
Fish is already as popular as poultry.
Though the figures of the Hamburg association are still preliminary, the trend is also confirmed by other sources.
The market research institute GfK has calculated that German households bought more fish between January and November 2006 than in the same period last year - despite significant price increases.
According to the GfK household panel, sales rose by only 0.5%, whereas the turnover of fish in the food retail trade was up by almost 6%.
There is a simple reason for the discrepancy between figures provided by the wholesale trade and the food retail trade: the latter accounts only for one part of the fish sales.
Households continue to buy about half of the fresh fish in specialty stores or on weekly markets.
Already in 2005, GfK calculated an increase in volume of 1.4%, compared to an increase in turnover of 3.5%.
Consumers are well-prepared to pay more for this trend product.
Although prices for fresh fish rose by almost 5% to an average of €10.00 per kg, this did not slow down the turnover: +1.5%.
The winners of the growing popularity of fish are, among others, supermarkets' fresh food counters.
They account for 11% of the overall fish sales.
The development of frozen fish and fish marinades is very similar, reports GfK:
Frozen fish has become the most important fish product with a market share of 32%.
Part of the success is due to the market entry of the discounters.
Supermarket customers are more price-sensitive when it comes to smoked or canned fish.
A rather high-priced distributor like 'Erftland-Forelle' recorded double-digit growth rates for Irish salmon - both in terms of volume and value - despite supply shortages.
The canned food segment, with products like herring in tomato sauce, still recorded a minor growth in turnover, although sales declined by 3%.
Only so-called 'other fishery products' like matjes herring, fish pâtés etc. recorded marginal decreases both in terms of value and volume.
This was the motto of 'Real's' latest fish weeks (Real is a subsidiary of Metro Group).
Fish from all over the world is no longer shipped by boat but by air freight/plane.
Thus, Frankfurt airport is now ranking first on the list of the most important ports of entry, followed by fishing harbours like Bremerhaven and Cuxhaven.
In 2005, the Center for fish information (FIZ) determined the importance of fish on the food market.
The study revealed that new species like the Asian catfish, New Zealand hike 'hoki', Victoria Perch and pike perch each account for 1 to 2%.
Their market shares in terms of value, however, are much higher due to the over-proportional prices.
Their annual growth rates are between 30 and 75%.
Fish retailers react with flexibility to the increasing shortage of traditional fish species.
Herring, cod and plaice are rare; classic species like sole and turbot are sold at delicatessen prices.
The gap between supply and demand is already growing, although fishing regulations imposed by the European Union are less stringent than required by scientists.
Aquaculture fish is gaining in importance.
Although frequently proclaimed, there are hardly any differences in quality between farmed fish and wild fish.
The gourmet magazine "Der Feinschmecker" took the chance of inviting fish retailers and chefs de cuisine to test five fish species, ranging from organically farmed to wild caught.
On a seminar in Hamburg, sector specialist Dr. Manfred Klinkhardt explained that the term 'aquaculture' comprises a broad range of methods and techniques:
But also in Germany, best-sellers like trout and carp are farmed in ponds.
Floating net cages on seashores mainly produce migrating fish like salmon and salt water species.
While yields in the fishing industry fluctuate by 90 million tons per year, the worldwide aquaculture production increased from 20 million tons in 1990 to more than 60 million tons.
Aquaculture is most common in Asia.
More than 54 million tons or 90% of the worldwide production comes from Asia, thereof 41 million tons from China.
However, the most important product is not fish or prawns but kelp, a water plant of which Japan alone produces 4.5 million tons per year.
The second most important product is Pacific rock oyster, whose production quadrupled over the last ten years, now accounting for 4.4 million tons.
The aquaculture production separates into 28 million tons of fish, 13 million tons of molluscs like mussels and snails and 3.7 million tons of crustaceans.
Shrimp farming in the North Sea The by far largest part of this production only has an indirect impact on the German or European market - despite the worldwide competition for raw materials.
The Asian carp production is twenty times larger than the European, but hardly anything of it reaches the European market.
When thinking of farmed fish, we mostly refer to carp, salmon and trout.
The worldwide annual production of these migrating fish amounts to 3 million tons, thereof 1.2 million tons Atlantic salmon.
Farming of saltwater fish species like bass, seabream, tuna and turbot accounts for only 1.4 million tons - not enough to relieve the world's overfished oceans.
But this sector is growing rapidly, and smaller amounts can have a huge effect on turnover.
Shrimp, for example, represents only 6% of the aquaculture production, but secures one fifth of its turnover.
The Dutch Fish Bureau recently announced that farming of tropical prawns and Australian lungfish (barramundi) has been resumed on the Dutch coast.
Water warmed by energy plants enables farming of these species even in our regions.
However, an annual production of 30 tons will go unnoticed by our Southeast Asian competitors.
Major German retailer Lidl supports sustainable fishing by offering MSC-labelled products Lidl, one of the largest German retailers, has introduced a range of one smoked and seven frozen fish products carrying the Marine Stewardship Council's (MSC) eco-label.
The company has initially introduced the products to its 3,000 stores in Germany and Austria and intends to grow this range and extend its use of the eco-label into other European countries.
Lidl is also committed to encouraging its supply fisheries to seek certification to the MSC's environmental standard for well-managed and sustainable fisheries.
While over 450 products in retail chains in 25 countries carry the MSC mark, Lidl is the first discounter to do so.
The new MSC line has been produced under the company's private labels "Ocean Trader" and "Ocean Sea".
The range consists of seven products made of Alaska pollock and one made of Alaska salmon.
Fisheries targeting both species have been identified by independent experts as meeting the MSC's environmental standard for well-managed and sustainable fisheries.
To date, 22 fisheries are certified to the MSC standard and a total of over 50 fisheries are engaged in the MSC programme.
Together, they record annual catches of more than 3.5 million tonnes of seafood.
They represent 42% of the world's wild salmon catch, 32% of the prime whitefish catch, and 18% of the lobster catches for human consumption.

Organic Market
Organic is gaining momentum Biofach presents trends - premiere for Vivaness The business of organic products is flourishing all over the world.
Experts forecast a turnover of clearly more than US$ 30 billion.
Biofach, held from Feb 15-18, 2007 in Nuremberg, underlines this trend with rising exhibitor and visitor numbers.
Organics, the market of the future, is growing.
But the boom does not only affect organic foods, but also natural cosmetics.
This is one of the reasons why the world's leading trade fair has allocated a separate hall to these products and celebrates the premiere of 'Vivaness'.
A total of 2,100 exhibitors will be presenting a comprehensive product range to some 37,000 visitors.
Organic is moving on, also in Germany.
The German Farmers Association (Deutscher Bauernverband DBV) forecasts an amount of €5 billion for 2007.
However, the German food retail trade sources an increasing number of products abroad, as Germany is running short of raw materials.
The huge demand is facing declining numbers of farmers willing to change to organic cultivation, now that Federal Länder and the EU have cut subsidies.
On the trade side, organics have developed into a trend product with which each distribution channel tries to distinguish itself.
Discounters have also entered the market - the latest to launch its own organic brand was soft discounter 'Penny'.
The current consumer panel for organic products, conducted by Lebensmittel Zeitung through interviews with readers of the online paper 'LZ-Net', reveals that 500 of the distributors interviewed expect an average price increase of 20%.
Two thirds of the interviewees are open to foreign products, but 47% of the industry and 40% of the trade are convinced that the product quality is below that of German products.
A niche product is dressing up Those who think much of themselves are buying organic.
Those who still think of organics as a niche product for eco freaks have definitely missed a trend.
A broad line of organically produced products has long found its way into the food retail trade.
The turnover with organic products has been rising steadily since 2000, as statistics of the Center for Market and Price Reporting have shown.
In 2005, this turnover amounted to almost €4 billion, which means that each household spent almost €45 for organic food.
But there are many different reasons for buying organic products.
A recent study of market researcher AC Nielsen revealed that the classic reasons which prevailed at the beginning of the organic movement like animal welfare (29%) and environmental protection (12%) have faded into the background.
Nowadays, 37% of consumers like to do something good for themselves and choose organic products because of their higher value of health.
Thus, consumers do not mind that organically produced products are still more expensive than conventional goods.
When renouncing chemical-synthetic treatment or fertilizers, the crop is about one third below that of conventional farmers.
The risk of crop shortfall is also higher.
It can be expected that the price margin of organic products will increase further.
"Customers can soon choose from a broad variety of organically produced products, reaching from low-priced to premium products", says Christoph Soika of Organic Consulting CSB/CSC.
The product variety will also be growing.
The share of organic products within a product group still varies significantly according to the figures of the Federal Agency for Agriculture and Food (BLE).
Bread and bakery products rank second with 12%, followed by meat and sausage products (10.5%) and herbs and spices (10.4%).
Frozen food is among the last of the ranking - only 1.7% of this product group is marked with the organic seal.
However, we cannot leave the growing market to foreign suppliers", says Harald Gabriel, CEO of Bioland.
In order to solve the problem in the long run, more German farmers would have to change to organic farming.
Until then there might be the danger that imported organic products would lead to strong competition among suppliers, fears Christoph Soika.
The pressure to deliver could provoke manipulations and might dilute the quality of organic products.
What can the trade do to offer organic products and - in the long run - ensure quality for their clients?
Loyal, reliable suppliers can ensure a steady supply."
Rundschau für den Lebensmittelhandel, February 2007
The premium segment 'organic' has obviously expanded worldwide and reached every product group.
Only the availability of raw materials seems to put limits to the growth of organics.
Aldi Süd, for example, plans to expand its product range and offer organic sausage.
However, manufacturers are lacking sufficient supply to be able to offer the product on a national level.
Due to the high demand, the market is running short of organic meat, which is already twice as expensive as the conventional product.
Dairies are also willing to pay 10 Cents more per litre for organic milk.
Organic pioneers do not have any sales difficulties, they are now being rewarded with additional supplies from their manufacturers.
Edeka Südwest signed a contract with Demeter which means that the whole Edeka Group can double their sales of organic fruit and vegetables.
Lebensmittelzeitung No. 8, February 23, 2007
Germany faces organic food shortages No other European nation has taken to organic food like the Germans, so much so that wholesale suppliers say the country could be just weeks away from a shortage of additive-free pork and potatoes.
"We are out of oats ... there are no more organic eggs to be had in Germany and France and when it comes to potatoes, nobody knows how we are going to keep the customer satisfied past mid-January," said Ulrich Hamm, the head of the agriculture and food marketing department at Kassel University.
Pork and poultry stocks, as well as vegetable supplies, are also running low, he added.
Shops said they were not yet feeling the pinch though they have been warned by their suppliers that problems lie ahead.
"We have been told that we are facing a shortage and we have noticed that the prices have gone up, but for the moment we are still fine," said a spokesman for Viv, a chain of organic food shops in Berlin.
The shelves in the organic section of the supermarket chain Kaisers are still well-stocked, but a spokesman for parent company Tengelmann told AFP:
"There is a drop in available stocks even if we have not run out of anything so far."
The very fact that mainstream supermarkets now sell "bio" food, as it is known here, attests to a strong increase in demand in Germany for fruit, vegetables and cereals grown without pesticides and livestock raised without antibiotics and growth hormones.
Industry sources say demand may have received a boost from a series of food scandals, notably a recurring problem with rotten meat, which have helped to drive home the importance of buying fresh produce even if it costs a little more.
The entry of big supermarket chains into the organic market also explains why producers were finding themselves overwhelmed, said Robert Erler, a spokesman for the Bio Company chain, which sells natural produce.
"Many have jumped onto the bandwagon and begun selling organic produce, and therefore supply has not been able to keep up with demand," he said.
He points out that, by its very nature, organic farming cannot be hurried.
For a start, its takes time and money to switch from conventional to organic agriculture.
Would-be organic farmers must wait at least two years for pesticides to be flushed out of their soil before they can plant apples, cabbages or carrots, the latter being the brand leader when it comes to organic food with 19% of all carrots sold in Germany now being produced organically.
Once producers have made the switch, it still takes a while for a pig raised to organic standards to mature before becoming bacon or "Leberwurst".
Kassel University's Hamm said Germany's organic food suppliers may have to fall back on imports from Latin America or Canada but for many fans this runs contrary to the philosophy of using seasonal foods grown close to home and in harmony with nature.
Organic Monitor, January 7, 2007, www.organicmonitor.com
Organic food products surge ahead Organic products are a market with a future.
The organic products market surged ahead in 2006.
During the period from January to September, private households increased their expenditure on organic food products by around 17% compared with the same period the year before.
Expanding the range of organic food products available at retail outlets has also increased their outreach and consequently, between spring and fall last year, 85% of all households bought at least one organic product.
In the same period the previous year, the figure was still 83%.
However, market growth has not only been achieved in terms of the higher number of households buying these products, but also in terms of the increased number of purchases: on average, two out of 13 food products bought by every household were organic, which is a higher figure than that for 2005.
Overall, in the first nine months of 2006, organic foods achieved a 2.7% market share of the overall food market.
The range of organic foods products expanded sharply in almost all the 29 product groups surveyed.
Right at the top are fresh goods such as fruit, vegetables, potatoes, eggs and dairy products.
However, with breakfast foods like honey, jams and cereals, consumers are finding that the number of available organically produced food products is over proportionally high and still rising.
Saturation point is still a long way away in the organic food market.
On the contrary: demand is growing, as organic foods become increasingly attractive and the developing popularity of these foods could become still more marked, as the available range of organic products expands.
This means that expenditure is higher for the same number of purchases, giving retailers higher value creation potential.
In general terms, organic products cost around 17% more than conventional equivalents.
This relatively low uplift is attributable on the one hand to different price levels for individual products and on the other, to differences between the prices charged by discounters and other retail outlets.
Although the discount stores also charge more for organic products than for non-organic goods, compared to other retail outlets, the price level is nevertheless distinctly lower.
Discounters are making good use of this opportunity and are using organic products to give their business a significant boost.
In 2005 as a whole, consumers bought around 75% more organic products from discount stores and in the first nine months of 2006, the growth rate was in excess of 80%.
A major share of food retailing is covered by own brand products, which are already recording an average of 39% of the total expenditure on organic food products.
Three distinct groups of consumers have been identified from those who buy organic food products and these are:
The "trial purchase" buyers, who represent half of consumers and consequently make up the broad majority of all households.
Their share of expenditure on organic products is still quite modest compared to their overall expenditure.
One in ten households belongs to the "core group" of consumers who may not buy solely organic products, but who place a high value on the share of organic products they buy.
All three groups have two aspects in common: they are willing to pay more for organic products and the proportion of discounted organic products they buy is on the increase, although these two factors apply to varying degrees.
The "core group" remains loyal to the organic shops and only uses discount stores to a negligible extent.
To conclude, the organic segment of the food sector is still ripe for development.
Acceptance of organic products is high, yet the number of purchases and the amount spent on organically produced food products is still at a low level.
Retailers have identified the development potential of their organic ranges.
The only difficulty seems to be ensuring product quality.
For organic products to live up to what they stand for means that the segment has to remain absolutely "clean".

Organic supermarkets on the wave of success Organic supermarkets continue to be the growth engine of the organic industry, although last year's increase in turnover was slightly below the figures for 2005.
According to the online newsletter "Bio-Handel", some 40 organic supermarkets opened in 2006, two thirds of which are subsidiaries of organic chains.
Moreover, another 100 shops opened with a sales area of less than 300 square metres.
In 2006, German organic chains opened 29 outlets in Germany and two in Austria.
Further expansion of organic chains in 2007 15 new organic supermarkets were founded in the first three months of the year in Germany.
Extrapolated to the whole year this will be around 60.
In the middle of this year it is expected that the barrier of 400 will be overridden.
Last year there were 56 new organic supermarkets with together 28,000 m² in retail space.
Since end of the nineties Germany is seeing a boom of new foundations and the creation of 15 chains which now operate 170 stores. www.organic-market.info Source:
Biofach Newsletter No. 143, April 5, 2007
Organic consumption on the up According to a study of market researchers GfK, the demand for organic products is unabated.
While 83% of the households said to have bought organic products at least once a week in 2005, the share went up to 90% in 2006.
Lebensmittelzeitung Direkt 02/2007
Farmers support expansion of the organic market The German Farmers Association (Deutscher Bauernverband-DBV) counts on further expansion of organic farming.
"Our target has to be the extension of organically cultivated areas - up from currently 830,000 hectares to 1 million hectares in 2008", says General Secretary of DBV, Dr. Helmut Born.
He is convinced that the presently strong demand for organic foods is anything but a flash in the pan.
He forecasts further growth of the organic market, "maybe with even higher growth rates".
The largest potential for local producers would be in sectors where "freshness and proximity are key".
In his mind, it is now up to the government to facilitate farmers' transition from conventional to organic farming.
Thus, he criticised the decision of some federal states in Northern Germany to terminate transition premiums.
Lebensmittelzeitung No. 9, March 2, 2007
Agriculture report sees organic farmers ahead "The latest Agriculture Report published by the German government shows above-average economic and social achievements in organic farming.
The profits of 310 companies examined in the business year 2005 increased by 5% over the previous year, which clearly puts them above the profit trend for comparable conventional farms.
The €44,673 profit produced by the organic farms was 31% above their conventional colleagues.
"This means market growth has finally reached the organic farms after some difficult years of business," says Felix Prinz zu Löwenstein, Chairman of the German Federation of the Organic Food Industry (BÖLW). www.boelw.de Source:
Organic dairy products growing more than total market Provisional estimates show that the total organic food market grew by 15 to 18% to reach €4.5 to €4.6 billion in 2006.
The turnover of organic milk and organic dairy products yoghurt, curd cheese and butter in the conventional food retail trade grew distinctly more than the total market according to data from the AC Nielsen trade panel and achieved 38% growth.
The increase of 26% in the organic food retail trade is also above the average growth rate of 9% -10% for the whole specialized trade.
"We receive our raw material from 'Ökoland'", says Helmut Müller, General Manager of 'Müller's Hausmacher Wurstwaren' in Ebstorf.
With regard to the growing demand, he adds that "long-lasting connections were especially important in 2006."
The company has been producing a few varieties of organic sausage in glass jars for eight years now - until 2005 exclusively for 'Ökoland'.
Since then, these products have been listed in the food retail trade.
Last year, sales of these products developed particularly well, continues Müller.
He is confident that the market will continue its positive development "though maybe not as strong as in 2006."
KG in Thannhausen also counts among the pioneers in the organic segment.
After their launch of fresh organic pasta products and preserved organic meat in 1997, they expanded their range by adding fresh meat and sausage products (for self-service counters) last spring.
"All in all, we are very satisfied with our sales figures", summarizes Günther Brandmeier, Head of Marketing and Distribution.
Due to high demand, organic meat as raw material has become scarce and clearly more expensive.
It's now paying off that they have maintained very good and close relationships with their suppliers for the last ten years.
Since 2001, they have been able to double their annual turnover of organic food products; meanwhile, organic accounts for one third of their product range.
"We have always been short of German organic pork and this will not change.
Only those who have established a longstanding, faithful relationship with their suppliers will not face any supply problems", describes Peppler.
He thinks that the raw material 'pork' is still under strict control.
Newcomers have a hard time sourcing the precious raw material, especially when looking for large amounts.
Prices hard to negotiate To secure the supply of raw material, Frank-Walter Eisenacher, General Manager of 'Fleischwarenfabrik Börner Eisenacher', even considers entering into pork breeding himself.
"The situation is so unstable that we were faced with several price increases over the last six months", describes Eisenacher.
To him, the main reasons for the shortage of organic meat are high demand and cuts of state support in the primary production stages.
Like many of his colleagues, he is convinced that the only way to solve the raw material problem is a binding contract with suppliers.
"A steady purchase amount is imperative.
Prices can hardly be negotiated", says Eisenacher.
The fact that organic meat is sometimes two, three or even four times as expensive as conventional meat also affects common retail prices.
"Our organic raw sausages are sold for more than €3.00 per kg, other varieties like black pudding (blood sausage / blutwurst) and liver sausage (leberwurst) are around € 2.00 per kg, scalded sausage between €1.50 and €2.00.
Offering organic sausage for less than €1.00 is far from being serious", says CEO of Rack & Rüther, Peppler.
Thomas Maruschke, General Manager of Fleischwarenfabrik Windau, confirmed that organic meat products offer "significantly more value".
"To sell the equivalent of 100 tons of organic salami I have to sell 250 tons of the conventional product", calculates Maruschke.
On the other hand, he is facing problems sourcing sufficient raw material for processing.
Thus, while maintaining his present relationships to larger slaughterhouses, he also involves smaller slaughterhouses as his suppliers.
On the manufacturing side, the long-term outlook for sales of organic sausage and bacon are very positive.
"We assume that organic bacon is not a short-lived trend, but will establish itself as a firm part of the segment.
The past has shown that it's not only health food stores that can successfully sell organic bacon", adds Stephan Holst, Marketing Manager of the Seevetal-based bacon specialist 'Abraham'.
For the current year, they expect to expand their growth rates even further.
Willi Denecke, Board Member of Zimbo Fleisch- und Wurstwaren GmbH & Co.
KG, is more cautious when evaluating the future development of organics.
"On the one hand, organic products are trendy.
On the other hand, the soaring demand is due to a growing need for food safety.
In the coming years, the organic sausage and bacon segment will maintain its position or even grow slightly."
In the middle of last year, Zimbo entered the organic market and launched six organic products, accounting for a production volume of 640 tons.
For this year, Denecke anticipates slight growth through the launch of new products, but product-specific figures will hardly change.
The share of organic products currently accounts for 2%.
"Though we will slightly increase the organic share, we are well aware that it will not grow substantially in the near future", explains Denecke.
Günther Brandmeier of Fleischwerke Zimmermann is a bit more optimistic.
Despite the current boom, organic is still a niche product.
But consumers are no longer only concerned about calorie and fat reduction or convenience, but also about sustainability and natural quality of the food.
"Thus, we are convinced that organics will develop into a solid part of the current lifestyle."
Gernot Peppler of Rack & Rüther also expects that organic will continue to grow, though only from its currently low market share.
Due to the positive outlook, there will likely be more distributors of organic sausage and bacon.
In view of the upcoming ANUGA trade fair, some companies may consider launching an organic product line, but they have not revealed any details yet.
Sufficient and continuous supplies of organic raw materials are vital to their success, but at the same time a bottleneck for entering the organic market.
"If the availability and a continuously high quality level cannot be secured, companies will be unable to satisfy their business partners."
Stockmeyer will most likely launch an organic raw sausage as "this is our key competence", says Meschkat.
High demand for organic salmon Dynamic market forecast - discussions on how to source raw material The organic wave is also affecting salmon.
German fish processors expect dynamic growth for the organic salmon market.
So far, mainly Scottish and Irish fish farms have discovered this niche market.
The sourcing of organic raw material - where prices are between 25 and 30% above those for conventional products - is viewed in several ways:
"We have good contacts", says Andreas Kremer, Manager Business Communication with Deutsche See in Bremerhaven.
The No. 1 in the fish and seafood market is offering organic salmon from Scotland which is certified by the British Soil Association.
"In co-operation with World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), we are running a project for ongoing ecological improvement of salmon aquaculture", explains Kathrin Runge, Marketing Manager.
Each package of organic salmon comes with the WWF's shopping guide for fish.
As only three salmon farms currently carry their (the Naturland-) logo, supply is running low."
Almost every distributor of organic salmon relies on the logo of 'Naturland'.
Unfortunately, wild-caught fish cannot be certified organic, as it is impossible to say where the fish are located and what they eat.
Organic wines establish themselves New distributors - the trade prefers entry-level wines from the South The demand for organic wines in the food retail trade is higher than ever.
The wave of success which already washed organic foods out of their niche in the food retail trade now also spreads to the wine segment.
"We have seen a real pull in the last months.
Many supermarkets, especially larger retail chains, are starting to establish an interesting range of organic wines", says Knut Rösemann, Acting CEO with VivoLoVin, one of the largest distributors of organic wines in Germany.
The demand is highest for wines ranging from €2.79 to €4.99, but even the price range from €6.50 to €7.50 is growing, namely red wines from Rioja and Australia.
The company was founded only last year by 'Mack & Schühle' and 'Peter Riegel Weinimport', the number one among organic wine specialists, and has specialised in the distribution of organic wines in the food retail trade:
They offer some 50 organic wines from Germany and abroad.
Christoph Mack, partner of 'Bionisys' expects a total turnover of more than 1 million bottles in 2007.
The best-sellers in the food retail trade are entry-level wines from Spain and Italy, such as the two lines from VivoLoVin called 'Solluna' from Southern Italy (€2.99) and 'Casa Leon' from La Mancha (€3.49), as well as more sophisticated wines from Southern France, Riesling, Rivaner and Dornfelder from Germany.
But the procurement of organic wines concerns distributors the most.
"While we are facing a high demand on the one side, sourcing of organic wines has become very difficult due to the small harvest of 2006", explains Christoph Schneider, the new Purchasing Manager for organic wines with 'Peter Mertes'.
They realized the best results with Riesling and Dornfelder, Pinot Grigio and French Chardonnay, but a positive development can also be expected for Tembranillo, which was added to the range in the last quarter of 2006.
Since it is still uncertain if the supply of last year's Riesling will be sufficient, they will offer a Rivaner together with the Silvaner they have already listed.
But 'Mertes' also plans to expand its red wine range and hopes to find the necessary volumes on the market.
Organic wine offers lucrative growth rates and profit margins, as long as the price-performance-ratio is appropriate.
'Mertes' knows that an organic Dornfelder can easily be sold for €4.49 next to a conventional Dornfelder for €2.99, but if the price gap grows even further, the organic wine might well turn into a non-seller.
Alcoholic Beverages Market
Their reasons bear a bitter undertone:
"There are two things which really annoy us at ProWein", complains Oliver Bartelt, Spokesman of Berentzen.
"Exhibition costs bear no proportion to the benefits.
The business is merely tailored to the needs of wine producers.
We have our annual strategical meetings in autumn and don't want to hold our innovations back until the following spring."
Besides, the trade fair is located too far outside of town.
They consider exhibiting at the Cologne 'ANUGA' instead (Oct 13-17, 2007), a trend which other spirits manufacturers might follow.
Lebensmittelzeitung Direkt 3/2007
Spirits With a per-capita consumption of 5.5 litres, Germany ranks 45th on the list of the world's leading spirits consumers - on the European level, Germany ranks 11th, which puts Germany at the lower end of the list.
The number one spirits consumers are the Virgin Islands with a consumption of 27.1 litres per head.
Miscellaneous
Bread consumption in Germany For 94% of the German consumers, bread is (still) a daily food.
This is the result of a representative survey about bread and biscuit consumption by CMA (Central Marketing Agency).
In 70% of households with children or older couples, bread is consumed even twice or three times a day.
The per capita consumption of bread, buns, small pastries etc. amounted to 86 kg in 2006.

European Market
With modern day organic farming originating in the continent, consumer demand for organic foods is highly established.
High sales growth is bringing the market share of products like organic milk towards 10% in a number of countries.
High market growth rates are causing many sectors to suffer from undersupply with imports meeting the shortfall in regional supply.
Although EU accession countries are becoming important sources, organic foods continue to be imported from a number of continents.
Almost all organic product categories are import dependent; important sources include Latin America and Africa for organic fruit and vegetables, Asia for organic beverages and ingredients, Australasia for organic meat products.
As consumers becoming increasingly sophisticated in their consumer behaviour towards organic foods, companies are focusing on supply chain management to ensure traceability from farm to fork.
Continuous supply is also a major concern with a number of European companies investing in developing countries to lock-in supply of organic products.
Produced from over 5 years of continuous research, this report gives an analysis of the European market for organic food & drink.
Market & competitive information includes:
• Market size of country markets
• Market size of leading product categories
• Historic and projected market growth rates
• Revenue forecasts
• Market drivers & restraints
• Organic standards & regulations
• Country reports

EU food and drink industry trends review The CIAA end of year review of the European food and drink industry's performance underlines again how significant the industry is to the EU economy.
The research, which gives an overview of the structure of the industry, evaluates trade activities and highlights the role of the EU industry on global markets, provides a detailed picture of the state of the industry.
The data covers the whole food and drink industry, and includes a compilation of indicators taken from Eurostat databases as well as those received from CIAA members.
Other sources such as OECD and World Bank have also been used.
"These 282,600 companies generate 47.8% of food and drink turnover and employ 61.3% of the sectoral workforce."
Comparison with the manufacturing industry as a whole highlights the important role of SMEs in the food and drink industry, said the association.
A large European survey also looked at the amount of innovation undertaken by the sector.
Although amount of innovation undertaken by firms tends to increase with firm size, a number of indicators demonstrate that most food companies, including SMEs, are genuine innovators and look continuously for opportunities to innovate.
Furthermore, product improvement is the top activity for SMEs.
These innovations lead to a quick improvement in those characteristics of a food product immediately related to satisfaction (i.e. taste, nutritional value).
Process improvement comes second among the changes pursued by SMEs.
Key sectors of the food and drink industry The "various food products" category is the largest sector of the food and drink industry, accounting for 26% of total turnover and 42% of the workforce.
This so-called "various food products" category is a heterogeneous group that includes bakery, pastry, chocolate and confectionery products but also pasta and baby food.
The meat sector, beverages and dairy products are also key branches of the industry and, together with the "various food products" category, they represent 77% of the total turnover and 84% of the total number of employees.
In the meat, dairy, various food products and beverages categories, more than 60% of EU turnover is processed in four Member States.
France ranks first in the meat and dairy sectors, while Germany dominates the "various products" category and the beverages sector.
The US is by far the number one EU trading partner (exports plus imports), followed by Brazil, Switzerland and Russia.
It is worth noting that exports to China increased by 24% in 2005 to reach €765 million.
After several years of stagnation, food and drink imports from China exceeded €2 billion, further to a 29% increase in 2005.
EU food and drink industry trends review Food and drink exports rose in 2005/2004 by 5.3%, significantly faster than the EU foodstuffs turnover.
Beverages and "various food products" sectors accounted for 56% of EU food and drink exports.
The intra-EU exports account for 17.5% of the turnover in 2005.
Comparisons between intra and extra-EU exports highlight the importance of trade flows in the internal market.
Intra-EU exports account for 60% to 85% of total sales in each of the 25 Member States.
EU-25 food and drink products on world markets World exports of food and drink products reached $289 billion in 2005 and registered a 60% increase over the period 2000-2005.
But the EU market share of global export market in food and drink products has been shrinking over the last ten years (from 24% to 20%) to the benefit of other exporters such Brazil and China (the EU-15 market share decreased from 24% in 1997 to 18% in 2004).
However, after some years of decrease, the performance of EU products in expanding markets like China, Brazil and India, measured as the share of EU goods compared to imports of food and drink products from other origins, registered a slight upward trend in 2005.
Furthermore, EU external trade balance has resisted better than the US.
Emerging countries, Brazil in particular, registered huge rises of their trade balance over recent years.
R&D In 2004, EU-15 R&D intensity, expressed as the R&D expenditure in the food and drink industry as a percentage of industry output, was, on average, 0.24%.
This is below the spending by the food and drink industries of its main competitors: the US (0.35%), Australia (0.40%) and Japan (1.21%).
Apart from these enterprises, three EU and four non-EU companies register R&D investment above the €100 million threshold.
Worldwide R&D investment continues to be concentrated in technology hardware, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and automobiles.
The food sector ranks 15th in the industrial sectors by aggregate R&D from the global top 2000 companies (one percent of the total against 55% for the four above-mentioned sectors).
CIAA is the voice of the European food and drink industry and defines its role and mission as representing the food and drink industries' interests, at the level of both European and international institutions.

EU organic food logo wins support The European Parliament's agriculture committee has backed calls for a European-wide organic food logo.
The report calls for a European logo for foods containing 95% organic ingredients.
It also calls for organic food to be completely free of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) - currently 0.9% of the product can be of GMO origin.
EU agriculture ministers are considering proposed regulation on organic production and food labelling.
She also says there should be closer inspection of foods and products to determine their origin.
"While introducing an EU organics logo (as proposed) would be positive in this sense, the existing private organic certifiers should be able to maintain their logos and set even higher or stricter standards if they want to."
According to a recent study by Organic Monitor, organic food sales in Europe are rising by about 15% a year.
Organic Monitor, Marketing Week of March 3, 2007
Austrian Market
Rewe Austria and Spar say good bye to price battles Food prices will be increasing in Austria - marketing campaign for organic products Austrian food distributors are succeeding in what their foreign neighbours can only dream of: food prices are increasing.
Rewe Austria and Spar, leaders in Austria's food retail trade, have renounced price wars.
Unimpressed by severe price wars (e. g. in Switzerland) due to the market entry of the discounters, food prices in Austria are climbing.
"Food prices recover, the times of fierce price wars are over", says Gerhard Ortner-Pitzl of Fessel, the Austrian subsidiary of market researcher GfK.
The official representation of employees (Arbeiterkammer - AK) has the same impression:
They registered an average price increase of 4% from April to December 2006.
The price rise is facilitated by the dominant position of the two largest food retailers.
In Austria, Rewe and Spar account for market shares of 37.6 and 35.1% respectively.
Both giants confirmed that they will no longer continue to sell products with price reductions of more than 50%.
Instead, Rewe is now granting discounts to its steady customers.
They want to establish quality standards instead of fighting low-price battles, and have launched a marketing campaign for quality and 'natural food products', says the company.
Even discounters rely on organic.
The Number 1 discounter 'Hofer', whose 380 markets account for a market share of 18%, is fine-tuning his product range and slowing down its pace of expansion.
"Back to the roots" is the name of its regional brand.
"There is a broad trend towards quality in the food retail trade", summarizes Peter Schnedlitz, Professor at the Vienna Institute for Trade and Marketing.
At the same time, the unexpected price increases hit the headlines of Austrian newspapers.
Food retailers object that the figures provided by the official representation of employees (Arbeiterkammer) can only partially be compared to previous year's figures:
Moreover, there is no distinction between brand name and private label products.
No. 3 in the food retail sector, 'Adeg', who was identified as the most expensive retailer, complains about "mistakes in determining the shopping basket".
Rewe Group Austria also sees 'inconsistencies'.
Supermarket subsidiary 'Billa' did not implement price increases in the amounts determined by the 'Arbeiterkammer'.
Price changes can be caused by price fluctuations for raw materials and energy.
Discount boom in Austria After years of decline, the food retail trade in Austria finally recorded increasing growth rates.
Without taking discounters into account, the industry realized a plus of 1.4%, "the largest turnover since 2003", says Martin Prantl, CEO of AC Nielsen Austria.
In 2005, the industry had to face a decline in turnover of 0.3%.
Even if the growth was smaller than in previous years, they still realized the highest increase in this sector, reported AC Nielsen.
"Expansion is slowing down and non-food promotions have lost a bit of their driving force", concludes Prantl.
In the last two years, Aldi subsidiary "Hofer" expanded strongly and has extended its market share to an impressive 18%.
Austria's largest fish distributor At the end of 2006, Metro Cash & Carry celebrated its 35th anniversary in Austria, reported Internet portal 'Medianet'.
With its 2,300 employees in twelve subsidiaries, the wholesale chain realized a turnover of €740 million in 2005.
The total sales area amounts to 136,800 square metres where some 48,000 products are sold to 500,000 customers.
Metro C&C lays special emphasis on a broad fish range.
They claim that they are Austria's largest fish distributor.
"We sell some 165 tons of fresh fish a month in our wholesale markets", says Hans-Gerhard Degen, General Manager and Purchasing Manager Food with Metro Cash & Carry Austria.
When taking canned fish and fish delicacies like smoked fish into account, the volume reaches more than 3,500 tons per year.
Their total fish range is comprised of more than 300 varieties, of which 80 are available every day.
The per-capita consumption of fish in Austria amounted to 7.7 kg in 2005.

Austria to keep its ban on GMO maize EU ministers turned down the second attempt to order Austria to drop its bans on two genetically modified (GMO) maize types, MON 810 maize made by Monsanto and T25 maize made by Bayer.
In June 2005, the Commission tried to get rid of the bans already, but environment ministers rejected the proposals then as well.
The Commission's draft order was proposed in response to a WTO ruling that attacked various national GMO safeguards for breaking international trade rules.
Only Britain, Sweden, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic supported the Commission, all other ministers were in agreement about the ban.
In the eyes of some observers, it looked like the Commission's attempt regarding the Austrian ban was a demonstration for the complainants Argentina, Canada and the United States that it was taking action to facilitate more approvals.
Privately, Commission officials said the biggest worry was more pressure from the three WTO complainants over GMO approvals, or from the two manufacturing companies themselves.

Organic farming reduces green house gas emissions Comparisons of greenhouse gas emissions from arable farming show that farming according to organic guidelines leads to a distinct reduction of emissions.
For example, 50% less carbon dioxide and 80% less methane are emitted after conversion from an intensive conventional farming model to organic farming.
The emissions of laughing gas are reduced by almost 99%.
Austria's organic farmers manage without 200,000 tons of chemical synthetic fertilizers, reports Bio-Austria, the Austrian federation.
Some 20,500 Austrian organic farmers already farm 400,000 ha with organic fertilizers like animal dung or compost.
Experts estimate that some 400 - 800 million tons of carbon could be absorbed from farm land throughout the world by using organic farming methods. www.bio-austria.at/presse Source:
Inadequate organic labelling in stores Consumers expect mainly organic goods in organic food stores.
A test carried out by the Employees Chamber together with the Austrian Consumer Protection Ministry in 23 organic supermarkets, organic food stores and health food stores in Vienna revealed distinct deficits, however.
Sonnentor sets up own chain of outlets As reported by the Austrian magazine Wirtschaftsblatt, the Austrian company Sonnentor plans to open twenty new organic stores in addition to the three existing Sonnentor outlets.
The well-known company based in Waldviertel north-west of Vienna is expanding.
Three franchise partners are already known, one of whom comes from Switzerland.
"Sonnentor stores are not to be confined to Austria," says Johannes Gutmann, Sonnentor founder and boss.
Gutmann, who set up the company in 1988, currently supplies customers in over 40 countries.
It all started with just three organic farmers in Waldviertel, who produced herbs and spices.
Sonnentor meanwhile has over 150 organic farmers and 200 cooperation partners under contract and sells over 600 articles.

Swiss market
Swiss Coop the first to feature nutritional profiles on packaging Swiss Coop is the first food retailer in Switzerland to feature new nutritional profiles on packaged foods.
The profiles are based on CIAA recommendations published in 2006.
Easy to understand serving size information will communicate levels of energy, sugar, fat, saturated fatty acids and salt included in a given amount of the product.
Consumers can thus inform themselves very rapidly.
By the end of 2007, 1,000 products will be labelled with a new style profile, in the medium term between 3,000 and 4,000 products.
The measures go far beyond standard requirements.
With these new profiles Coop is making an active contribution towards informing the public about health and nutritional issues, thus creating added value for consumers, according to a press release.
Exports drive Swiss chocolate sales In 2006 Switzerland's 18 chocolate manufacturers achieved record growth in sales volume of 4.5%, up to 168,250 tons worth CHF 1.52 bn, a rise of 4.1%.
These results were announced by the Union of Swiss Chocolate Manufacturers, Chocosuisse.
Exports accounted for 58.7% of sales (2005: 57%).
On the as good as saturated home market Swiss manufacturers chalked up growth of 0.8% in sales volumes, which totalled 69,523 tons, while sales value was down by 1.2% to CHF 793 m.
The domestic market share of imported chocolate continued to rise and now stands at 29.8%.
Domestic consumption of chocolate confectionery (not including cocoa and chocolate powder) of 90,134 translates into per capita consumption of 11.9 kg, a further rise of 300 g per head.
Sales of Swiss chocolate abroad in creased by 8.1% up to 98,727 tons.
Sales value climbed by 10.6% to total CHF 733 m.
Fastest growth was reported for sales of solid chocolate bars (17.6%) and filled chocolate bars (12.7%).
Once again Germany was the top export market, accounting for 19.5% of shipments abroad, followed by France (12%), the UK (10.4%), and the USA (7.6%).
Swiss chocolate also performed well in Belgium, Italy, Norway, Poland, Sweden and Hungary, as well as Brazil, Canada, South Korea, Russia and in the UAE.
In 2007 Swiss chocolate manufacturers aim to further boost exports while maintaining their domestic market share.
Pet Food Market in Germany
Lifestyle, wellness and low-calorie diet for our little pets When it comes to our four legged friends, German pet owners know no bounds.
While they count every €o for their own nutrition, their dogs, cats & co. eat high-priced specialty food.
German pets lead a privileged life.
While pet owners buy most of their food at discounters, only 11% of the dogs (cats: 16%) eat discount feed.
The figures from Information Resources Inc.
(IRI) are an unmistakable proof that rational aspects like price play (only) a minor role when purchasing pet food.
"For many people, pets are a substitute for a partner or children", say market researchers of IRI.
Thus, it is not surprising that pet owners want to indulge their four legged friends and prefer specialty pet food.
"Wellness, health and additional health benefit are the key words", explains Jörg Barkei, Director Sales and Marketing in Grimborn.
Tablets in bone shape Therefore, the Emmerich-based company exclusively offers pet products with an additional health benefit.
With each chewing movement, 'Denta' cleans dogs' teeth with a high cellulose content and specialty powder.
Ralph Bauer, Market Director with Affinity Petcare, is convinced that the trend towards specialty food according to breed, age and environment will be ongoing.
The Cologne based company sees strong momentum for specialty food for different breeds, and is counting on "Ultima breeds", a product that they have successfully established in the market.
The dry food is rich in nutrients for big cats like Maine Coon, long-haired cats like Persian and active cats like Siamese.
Other manufacturers are also convinced that specialized super premium foods will be successful and are expanding their product range accordingly.
Masterfoods recently started to broaden their 'Perfect Fit' line for dogs.
'Active', 'In-Home' and 'Sensitive' are tailored to the needs of active breeds, home dogs and sensitive pets.
'Senior' is destined for older dogs; 'Junior' for young puppies.
'Perfect Fit' is now also available as wet food for cats: chicken and beef with sauce and poultry in aspic.
For infertile cats and their golden years Vitakraft launched a monthly package for cats in their golden years.
Nestlé Purina's 'Purina One Sterilcat' meets the nutrient demand of neutered male cats.
Many pets are gaining weight due to the change in hormone levels.
The individual protein-fat ratio is to help loose excessive weight - what a (pets) life!

News and Information Outstanding Success for Canada's Winemakers  Canadian Wines Triumph in Italy
Canadian wines achieved an outstanding success at the 40th VINITALY, the international wine exhibition closing up today in Verona, northern Italy.
Canada also garnered a record of: 1 Gold medal, 1 Silver medal, 1 Bronze medal and 20 Grand Mentions.
The Special Prize Vinitaly 2006, the second highest prize at stake (for winemakers) has gone to Jackson Triggs Vintners Okanagan Estate (Oliver).
The latter received two of the Grand Gold Medals for its Syrah Okanagan Valley VQA "Sun Rock Vineyard" 2003 (red wines, vintages 2003-2005) and Cabernet Sauvignon Okanagan Valley VQA Grand Reserve 2002 (red wines, vintages 2000-2002).
The other two Grand Gold Medals went to the Pillitteri Estate Winery, Niagara on the Lake, for its Vidal Icewine Niagara Peninsula VQA 2004 and Vidal Sparkling Icewine Niagara Peninusula VQA 2004, respectively.
Magnotta Winery Corporation, Vaughan Ontario, took home a gold medal thanks to its Riesling Icewine Niagara Peninsula VQA 2003.
Canadian Ambassador Robert Fowler and Consul General Margaret Huber heartily congratulated the Canadian companies attending Vinitaly, including Grand Gold Medal winner Pillitteri Estate Winery.
They also called Jackson-Triggs Vintners to congratulate the firm on its Grand Gold Medal awards.
VINITALY, held in the biggest wine-producing country in the world, is considered by winemakers the most prestigious event of the year.
3,482 wines from 30 different countries participated in this 14th edition of the international wine competition.

From March 31 to April 22, Canadian products were featured in 60 gourmet shops, 60 restaurants and over 50 supermarkets and cafeterias.
Developed in partnership with El Corte Inglés (ECI), this integrated promotion introduced our products to the restaurant industry and to retail sales outlets throughout the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal).
The exercise, made possible by the cooperation and efficiency of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC), made a remarkable contribution to the development of Canada's brand image through a major media campaign.
The association with the ECI, Spain's largest distribution chain with annual sales of 14 billion euros, was supported by a Canadian partnership deftlly spearheaded by AAFC.
Canadian provinces and associations (mainly Ontario, Quebec and B.C.) worked with AAFC to organize specific buyer programs in order to identify products that meet the buyer's strict selection criteria.
The project was in line with AAFC's strategic priorities, i.e.: promoting value-added products (bison meat, cranberries, ice wines, etc.), introducing new products to hotels, restaurants and institutions (sauces, preserves, seafood, etc.) and offering new Canadian products to a young, upscale clientele that enjoys discovering new culinary options.
Most Canadian products that meet these criteria are made by young Canadian SMEs seeking new export markets.
• Increase the number of active exporters to Spain, the 3rd-largest European market for Canadian agri-food products, fish and seafood
• Increase exports of high value-added food products
• Develop Canada's brand image in Spain and Portugal
• Develop a special relationship with El Corte Inglés, Spain's largest retailer.
THE PROJECT: 1.
Planned an integrated promotion at Gourmet Clubs, megastores supermarkets, restaurants and cafeterias simultaneously, so as to reach different types of consumers; 2.
Introduced 100 value-added products representing purchases of close to C$1 million; 3.
Delivered a major promotional campaign in Spain: radio, newspapers and specialty magazines based on value-added products and Canada's cutting-edge approach (see attached article); 4.
Printed 40,000 ECI catalogues on Canadian products available during the event, sent to ECI's best clients and available at Gourmet Clubs (attached); 5.
Published 40,000 copies of a 23-page article on Canada in ECI's Gourmet magazine, sent to ECI's best clients and also available at Gourmet Clubs; 6.
Translated AAFC's recipe book, "Canada, l'excellence à votre table" ["Canada, excellence at your table"] and published 4,000 copies distributed to ECI's best clients, journalists and Embassy contacts to promote the use of Canadian products at home; 7.
Printed 500 tabs with a photo of the recipe book sent to the Embassy's best contacts to publicize the book; 8.
Printed 2,000 high-end menu cards sent to ECI restaurants with Canada's brand image; 9.
Trained 60 chefs from ECI's top restaurants in July 2005 for the menu created by a Canadian chef in partnership with Clearwater and the Canadian embassy (activity report attached); 10.
Organized an ECI buyers' mission in September 2005; 11.
Published a 4-page article in the weekly glossy supplement "Fuera de Serie" in "Expansión", Spain's largest economic paper; article published for the occasion, focusing on gourmet foods in Canada, including the cover page (article attached - following message); 12.
Two official inaugurations were organized, one in Vigo and the other in Madrid.
The Madrid inauguration launched the promotion with a ribbon cutting where the press and product tastings preceded a restaurant meal for 60 guests featuring the Canadian menu.
The Vigo inauguration was an opportunity for lobbying national and regional fishery industry authorities, who were also invited to taste the Canadian menu (100 guests participated in the Vigo event).
THE RESULTS: 1.
ECI purchased almost $1 million worth of some 100 products from all sources (see attached list of products found in stores); 2.
The budget for organizing the event was 91,400 euros, plus VAT; 3.
Permanent listing of certain wine, cider and preserve products (repeat orders by ECI); 4.
Resolution of problems accessing the Spanish market for lesser known products such as: wild rice, special preserves, maple products or alcoholic beverages (improved market access); 5.
We are negotiating with ECI to follow up on this activity, particularly by organizing a "seafood products" promotion for the 2006?2007 holiday season.
CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED:
The timing of this activity coincided with Canada's seal hunt.
Campaigns against the hunt and the resulting negative publicity led to the cancellation of certain press and communication events.
Overall, the crisis was effectively managed by minimizing public activities.
Organizing an activity simultaneously in two countries was a challenge.
ECI's Portuguese section does not appear to have followed through on all of its obligations, which resulted in the cancellation of most activities in Portugal.
I take this opportunity to thank Dianne Guindon, AAFC's Senior Officer, Europe, who was instrumental to this major promotion.

Whatever whets your appetite — Atlantic lobster, Prairie bison, Quebec ice ciders — you can be sure it will be of the highest quality.
Canada prides itself on bringing you nothing less than the best.
Canada’s agriculture and agri-food sector is one of the oldest and most important sectors of our economy, deeply rooted in Canadian history and culture.

Scallops There are usually three types of scallops available.
Sea scallops are the largest, followed by bay scallops and calico scallops.
The meat of these morsels can be creamy white, tan or creamy pink.
Scallops are usually shucked right after harvest and are sold fresh or frozen.
Keep scallops as healthy and fresh-tasting as possible by cooking them in little or no oil or fat.
Try them broiled, poached, grilled, stir-fried or pan-fried.

Lobster In Canada, lobster is harvested and processed throughout the Atlantic provinces (Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island) and Quebec.
Landings peak twice a year: once in the period from April to June, when the spring season opens; and then again in December, after the winter fishery opens in southwestern Nova Scotia.

Clearwater Seafoods (www.clearwater.ca/storefront/)
Snow crabs are caught in traps, from sandy bottoms in depths of 1 to 470 metres.
The Canadian fishing season runs from April to November.
Commercially caught crab measure from 9.5 to 15 cm in width and weigh from 350 g to 1.3 kg.
When cooked, the shell of the snow crab turns bright orange.
The meat has a rich, sweet flavour and firm texture.
Orangey-pink on the surface and white inside, the meat of the snow crab is composed of fine, tender filaments that are exquisitely mild and tasty.
Canadian Snow Crab Cheese Puffs
75 g flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder salt, pepper and cayenne pepper to taste 50 g Canadian medium Cheddar, grated 1 egg, separated (at room temperature) – 20 – 100 mL milk 25 g butter, melted 100 g Canadian snow crab meat, drained Makes approximately 20 small puffs
Method In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, and cheese.
In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, milk, and melted butter, then add the crab and green onions.
In another bowl, whisk the egg whites to soft peaks.
Stir the yolk mixture into the dry ingredients, just to blend, then gently fold in the beaten egg whites.
In a medium frying pan over medium heat, melt some butter, then drop in teaspoons of the mixture, cooking until puffy and golden brown.
Add the egg, salt, pepper and lemon juice and set aside.
Lightly brush one side of a crepe with egg white, then spoon one soup spoon of the crab mixture onto the crepe.
Fold in both sides of the crepe, then roll it into a small log (resembling a spring roll) and place the rolls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
Lightly brush the rolls with oil and bake at 200ºC for 4 to 8 minutes, turning often for even browning.
Arrange the rolls on a platter and serve with lettuce leaves to wrap the rolls and dip them into the sauce.
Method (crepes) In a medium-sized bowl, mix the flour, salt and pepper.
Whisk in the eggs, then add the milk and melted butter.
In a small frying pan or crepe pan over medium-high heat, pour a small amount of batter and spread evenly, keeping the crepes as thin as possible.
Cook for 1 to 2 minutes per side.
Crepes 50 g flour salt and pepper to taste 2 eggs 125 mL milk 25 g butter, melted
Method (sauce) Combine the maple syrup, mustard, ginger, Worcestershire sauce and lemon juice.
Let stand at room temperature before serving to allow flavours to blend and to prevent the sauce from cooling the crepe rolls.
This sauce can be made ahead of time and kept refrigerated, but allow it to warm to room temperature before serving it with the crepe rolls.
Cooking alternative:
The rolls may be deep-fried in a wok or deep fryer at 190ºC for 3 to 5 minutes.
Makes approximately 20 crepes Source:

Salmon The Atlantic salmon is born in fresh water and remains there until it undergoes a physiological transformation allowing it to tolerate salt water.
After one to three years at sea, the salmon returns to its river of origin to spawn.
It therefore has two distinct habitats: freshwater rivers and the ocean.
On British Columbia’s Fraser River, the largest salmon river in the world, sockeye are managed under strict conservation practices.

Wild Rice Wild rice, derived from the wild aquatic grass called Zizania aquatica, grows naturally in the pristine lakes of Manitoba and Saskatchewan.
In the early days, this most delicious staple of the First Nations of Canada was harvested entirely by hand.
The grain was dried over wood fires, "danced" upon in pots to remove the hulls, and winnowed clean using birchbark pans and the wind.
Today, wild rice is harvested mechanically, with a harvest area being picked over as many as eight times to complete the harvest.

Beans/Lentils Pulses are the dry seeds of legumes, including peas, beans, lentils, and chick peas.
Canada grows high-quality pulses at relatively low costs.
Our cool climate provides pulse crops with natural protection against insects and disease.
In addition, Canada has a well-established infrastructure to store and move grain and pulses from the producing regions to the port terminals.

Canadian Mushroom Soup
30 g mixed dry Canadian wild mushrooms, coarsely chopped 625 mL water or chicken stock or vegetable stock, heated 400 g onion, chopped 50 g butter 50 g all-purpose flour 1 L milk – 36 – 11/2 soup spoons paprika 250 mL sour cream 2 teaspoons salt 1 soup spoon fresh lemon juice 2 teaspoons dill weed 1 soup spoon soy sauce

Slowly whisk in the mushrooms and their soaking liquid and cook over medium heat until thickened.
Add milk and paprika and simmer another 2 or 3 minutes.
Whisk in 125 mL of the sour cream, then add remaining ingredients.
Garnish with a dollop of sour cream in the bowl.
Wild Mushrooms Many commercial harvesters are nomadic, following the natural supply of mushrooms.
The natural supply may be determined by rainfall, forest fires or other factors, depending on the particular species.
For example, in the spring, harvesters may travel to the Yukon, Northwest Territories or northern Saskatchewan to pick morels.
They return to British Columbia in the fall to harvest chanterelles and pine mushrooms.
Sauté the vegetables approximately 10 minutes, then add the tomatoes, stock and wild rice and bring to a boil.
Cover and simmer for approximately 1 hour.
Season with salt, pepper and basil.
Traditional-style Canadian Pea Soup
1 kg dried peas (split yellow peas) 300 g salt pork 50 g lard 100 g carrots, diced 100 g celery, diced – 40 – 100 g onion, diced 1 bunch parsley, coarsely chopped 1 bouquet garni 1 bay leaf salt and pepper

Add the softened peas, vegetables, bouquet garni, parsley, bay leaf, salt and pepper.
Add enough cold water to cover, bring to boil and simmer for about 2 hours.
Pea Soup Soupe aux pois (yellow pea soup) is a signature dish in French Canadian cuisine.
One source says, "The most authentic version of Quebec’s soupe aux pois uses whole yellow peas, with salt pork and herbs for flavour.
Newfoundland and Labrador pea soup is very similar, but usually includes root vegetables such as turnips, and is often topped with small dumplings."
Canadian Fish Chowder
60 g butter 1 medium carrot, sliced 1 onion, finely diced 1 celery stalk, finely diced 12 Canadian mussels, cooked 12 Canadian oysters 240 g white fish 240 g Canadian coldwater shrimp 30 mL brandy – 42 – 60 mL tomato puree 125 mL white wine 1 teaspoon Canadian grain mustard 250 mL fresh cream Makes 6 to 8 servings

Bison Skewers in Wine Marinade
450 g bison sirloin steak, cubed
Method 2 garlic cloves, minced 125 mL Canadian dry white wine 1 1/2 soup spoon olive oil salt and pepper to taste – 46 – 1-2 Spanish or red onion, sectioned 1-2 sweet pepper, sectioned (red, green, yellow, orange – depending on availability) 22 cm wooden skewers Prepare the marinade (garlic, wine, salt, pepper and oil) combine with the bison cubes in a small plastic freezer bag, draw out the air and tie off.
Bison should not be cooked until well-done.
For tenderloin, loin roasts, rib roasts, top sirloin and sirloin butt, preheat oven to 140°C.
After 10 to 20 minutes, enjoy!
Slice the roast at right angles to the grain.
(With thin roasts, cut diagonally across grain.)
Steaks Although tender cuts (tenderloin, loin steaks, rib steaks) do not require marinating, doing so yields the best results.
Marinate steaks for 24 hours in a favourite marinade before cooking.
Grill over HIGH heat only to sear and seal.
Transfer to the COOL side of the grill for 6 to 15 minutes, depending on steak thickness, turning frequently.
Do not cook beyond medium-done 70°C.
Bison meat continues to cook even when it has been removed from heat.
Burgers Bison patties do not shrink as regular beef hamburger patties do.
They also take less time to cook.
If the grill or pan is too hot, the patties may stick.
Ground bison is foolproof when added to recipes such as chili or meatloaf.
Canadian Bison Association (www.bisoncentral.com)
Grill on the barbecue for only 5 to 6 minutes, turning once, ensuring the meat is not overcooked.
Heat the reserved marinade to the boiling point, remove from heat, then set aside and pour it over the cooked meat.
Makes 3 to 4 servings Source:

Bison Bison are well adapted to the extreme weather conditions in northern Canada.
They are hardy animals that graze in a variety of tame pastures, wild pastures and wet meadows.
Bison can graze through heavy snow cover and they also substitute snow for water.
They require less labour and maintenance than traditional livestock.
Because the bison metabolism slows in the winter months, they require less feed to maintain their condition.
Over 230,000 bison are raised on ranches across Canada.
Bison meat, unlike other red meat, does not have marbling in the muscle structure; therefore, it requires low cooking time and temperature.
Roast Bison and Wild Mushrooms
1.5 kg bison shoulder roast 125 mL red wine 180 g pumpkin puree 250 mL bison demi-glaze 2 soup spoons fresh sage, chopped salt and pepper 500 g assorted Canadian wild mushrooms – 52 – butter (to sauté mushrooms)
Method (bison) If using a whole roast of bison, roast the bison at 150ºC until the internal temperature reaches 60ºC.
While the bison is roasting, reduce the red wine by half in a saucepan.
Add the pumpkin puree, bison demi-glaze and sage.
Simmer for 30 minutes and season to taste.
(If using medallions, sear them in a hot pan, ensuring they do not overcook.
Lightly sauté the mushrooms in a bit of butter.
To serve, layer medallions or thin slices of roast bison on the pumpkin puree and top with the sautéed mushrooms.
Method (demi-glaze) For a quick demi-glaze, thicken the beef consommé until it coats the back of a wooden spoon.
Make a roux by melting the butter in a saucepan and stirring in the flour, then let cool.
Whisk the hot consommé into the cooled roux and bring to a boil.
Reduce heat and simmer until it reaches the desired thickness.
Alternative:
Use 40 g bison medallions per serving rather than the shoulder roast.

Fédération des producteurs acéricoles du Québec (www.siropderable.ca/en/default.asp?section=0&IdArticle=21)
Maple Canada is the largest producer of maple syrup in the world.
There are more than 10,000 maple syrup producers in Canada, primarily in Quebec, with the remaining in Ontario, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
Syrup producing trees are sugar maples, red maples and silver maples.
During the maple sugaring season, an average tree yields between 35 to 50 litres of sap, which will produce between 1 to 1.5 litres of maple syrup.
Late Summer Barbecued Pork
500 g pork tenderloin 375 mL Canadian Riesling 2 teaspoons orange zest 60 mL orange juice 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh tarragon, chopped 1/2 teaspoon Canadian grain mustard 1 garlic clove, minced 12 thin orange wedges (about 2 small oranges) 8 thin red onion wedges (about 1 small onion) (optional) – 58 – salt and pepper to taste 22 cm skewers

Cranberries The cranberry is a native American wetland fruit which grows on trailing vines, much like a strawberry.
The vines thrive on the special combination of soil and water properties found in wetlands.
Cranberries grow on low-lying vines in impermeable beds layered with sand, peat, gravel and clay.
These beds are commonly known as bogs or marshes and were originally created by glacial deposits.
First Nations peoples had several uses for cranberries: they added flavour and vitamins to pemmican (a mixture of dried meat and fat), they were used to make poultices for wounds, and they were used in the dying of fabrics.

Maple Sugar Well before the arrival of the European settlers, First Nations peoples knew about and savoured the sap from maple trees and used this "sugared water" to cook game.
Much later, in 1702, when war between France and England prevented many basics, including sugar, from being delivered to New France, Agathe de Saint-Père, wife of Pierre Legardeur de Repentigny, of Montréal, initiated the production of maple syrup.
When spring came, she and her French and First Nations neighbours tapped the maples and produced sugar from the sap they obtained.
Within a few years, Agathe de Saint-Père reported to the King of France that the Montréal colony annually produced 13,600 kg of maple sugar.

Icewines Icewine is the sweet, luscious and intensely flavoured dessert wine made from grapes that have been frozen on the vine.
Canadian icewines are produced in both Ontario and British Columbia, with most being made from the thick-skinned white grape Vidal or Riesling varieties.
The grapes are picked by hand and pressed when nearly frozen solid, resulting in only the smallest quantities of juice with highly concentrated natural sugars and high acidity.
Within each frozen grape are the flavours of the tropics: pineapple, guava, passion fruit and mango.

Wines Canada has seven designated viticultural areas located in the southern areas of the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia.
These fertile wine-producing areas are located between 41 and 50 degrees latitude, placing them within the same range as the Champagne region of France, Rioja in Spain, southern Oregon and Northern California in the United States and the Chianti Classico region in Italy.
The wine producing areas of British Columbia are the Fraser Valley, the Okanagan Valley, the Similkameen Valley and Vancouver Island.
In Ontario, wines are produced in the Niagara Peninsula, the Lake Erie North Shore region, Pelee Island and Prince Edward County.

Beer Beer was first brewed in Canada three centuries ago by our early settlers and traders.
After Jean Talon built Canada’s first commercial brewery in 1668 in the City of Québec, beer making was a cottage industry for the next century.
The first brewery in Montréal was established in 1786.
This event marked the beginning of the industry’s development period as small, independent breweries began to open across the country.
By the 1870s, brewing was a strong, modern industry with brewers located across the country, from the Maritimes to British Columbia.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The French are enthusiastic consumers of seafood.
Per-capita fish and seafood consumption was over 29 kg in 2002 and is estimated to be increasing at a rate of 2% per year.
In 2002, the French market for fish and seafood was valued at over $14 billion (1).
Domestic production is well below consumption.
In 2002, imports of seafood exceeded 1.4 million tonnes to reach a value of $4.9 billion.
France has a structural trade deficit in fish and seafood.
High tariffs, especially on processed seafood products, create challenges for Canadian exporters and make it difficult to compete solely on the basis of price.
Fortunately, French consumers appreciate healthy, high quality foods.
Since the mid-1980s there has also been a trend toward convenience.
French consumers appreciate proper cuts and packaging, and are open to buying seafood in processed, pre-cooked and ready-meal formats.
Moreover, fish and seafood are seen increasingly as healthy alternatives to meat.
Canada's main fish/seafood exports to France are scallops, lobster, dogfish and pike.
Canada's fish and seafood exports grew sharply in 2001 and remained strong in 2002, despite a sluggish French economy.
In addition to Canada's main exports, there are also good market prospects for lumpfish roe, mussels, salmon and shrimp.

MARKET OVERVIEW France has the fourth-largest economy in the world and is among the world's largest traders.
It is also an influential member of the European Community.
The French economy is extremely diversified and modern.
While it has traditionally been associated with high-value luxury goods, France is a world leader in many sectors including telecommunications, agri-food, insurance and banking.
Its transportation infrastructure is the most advanced in the world.
In 2002, France's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per-capita was $37 637 compared to $36 516 in Canada.
Economic activity is expected to fall again in 2003, with an estimated growth rate of only 0.5%.
The five-year economic growth forecast is more promising, with domestic demand making a significant contribution to economic activity.
From 2004 to 2007, economic growth is projected to be between 2.1% and 2.5%.
France has a structural trade deficit for seafood.
Domestic production is limited by available stocks and the EU Common Fishery Policy.
EU and, in turn, French fisheries policy needs to be understood against the background of full or overexploitation of marine resources.
Wanting to ensure adequate supply for processing and consumption, EU policy makers will increasingly scrutinize existing tariff and non-tariff barriers.
There is an important aquaculture industry in France, but it is expected to remain significantly lower than the wild catch.
In 2002, imports of seafood exceeded 1.4 million tonnes to reach a value of $4.9 billion.
Imports include crustaceans, frozen fillets, and fresh and frozen fin fish.
French consumers enjoy fish and seafood in all processing formats: chilled, frozen and canned.
The market for canned seafood has the highest penetration rate.
About 97% of French households buy some form of canned fish; tuna salad, sardines and canned salmon are the most popular.
In addition, 86% of households purchase frozen seafood and 83% of households purchase fresh chilled fish or seafood products.
In 2001, the market for frozen processed seafood was valued at $359 million; by 2005, it is forecast to reach a value of $365 million.

Key Factors Shaping Market Growth Market Trends There is a gradual but consistent decline in chilled fin fish sales in the French seafood market.
This segment has lost over 8% of market share since 1996, corresponding to a general price increase (over 18% for the same period).
Yet retail prices for prepackaged chilled fin fish rose 33% between 1996 and 2000, while sales increased 23%.
These figures indicate that French consumers are sensitive to price but will pay more for convenience.
In 2000, sales of seafood-based, chilled ready meals increased 12.5% in volume and 13% in penetration rate (proportion of households who buy the type of product).
The same growth was also seen in seafood spreadables (terrines, pate and rillettes).
In the same year, sales of frozen seafood-based, ready meals fell by 9%.
Forecasts indicate that by 2010, prepared cooked products will account for 32% of fish counter seafood sales, smoked and cured products will account for 31.5%, seafood charcuterie for 25% and ready-to-use products for 11.5%.
Economy brands will decrease their market share from 8% in 2003 to 3% in 2010.
Salmon France is the leading consumer of salmon in Europe.
Although demand for the product follows an upward trend, there are pronounced differences between product types.
Farmed salmon consumption has suffered from adverse publicity about the environmental impact of aquaculture.
Concerns about fish feed composition are also augmented by the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease crisis.
Despite these concerns, salmon remains the most consumed species of fish in France.
In 2001, retail sales of chilled gutted salmon declined in volume by 9%, while sales of prepackaged chilled salmon portions increased 24%.
In 2001 and 2002, Norway and Scotland remained the leading suppliers of salmon.
Scottish salmon enjoys the best reputation for quality.
U.S. producers also have some position in the salmon market but face increasingly stiff competition from Chile.
The United States is a leading supplier of canned salmon in France.
Scallops The French market for scallops is over 81,648 tonnes per year (shelled weight).
In France, scallops are marketed in three forms: chilled or shucked meat, live shell, or on and in preparations.
Approximately 73% is sold frozen and half of frozen stock is purchased for further processing, going into prepared meals.
Only one third of scallops are sold at the retail level; the remaining two thirds of scallops products are purchased by hotels and restaurants.
These tremendous increases have been attributed to the plentiful and high-quality supply from Canada's east coast fisheries.
In 2002, Canadian exports were stable at their 2001 levels.
Scallops are considered to be a luxury product and like lobster, the demand is significantly higher around Christmas and New Year's.
Recently, there has been some effort put into encouraging French consumers to enjoy "luxury seafood" products all year round.
Lobster In 2001, the French market for imported lobster was valued at approximately $210 million.
Frozen lobster is the most popular with close to a 48% market share, followed by live, fresh/chilled.
Like most places, lobster is considered to be a luxury product and is therefore consumed mainly during the holiday season.
Consumers, while sensitive to price, expect to pay more for this product.
Canadian lobster has been able to overcome the competitive disadvantage of high tariffs because of its high quality.
Canada and the United States are the leading suppliers of lobster.
Other Shellfish and Crustaceans In 2002, the supermarket sales of mussels were valued at $109 million; oysters, $125 million and crabs, $34.2 million.
All of the crab and close to half of all mussels sold at retail markets were imported.
In 2001, France's shrimp imports were valued at $723 million.
It is estimated that 15-20% of these imports were Nordic shrimp; the rest are tropical varieties.
Canadian shrimp exporters face stiff competition from Norway, Iceland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
All of these countries enjoy more favourable market access with respect to tariffs and quotas than Canadian producers.
The fish is usually imported for further processing.
Pike is the major ingredient in quenelles, a poached fish preparation that is very popular in the region.
Consumption of freshwater fish is growing: in 2001, consumption of freshwater fish rose 8.8% over 2000.
Lumpfish Roe Overfishing has dangerously diminished caviar supplies.
Lumpfish roe is considered to be an environmentally responsible, less expensive alternative to this luxury product.
The European Union, recognizing the urgency in protecting Caspian Sea sturgeon stocks, suspended tariffs on lumpfish roe and other caviar substitutes in 2002.
Dogfish Dogfish is a species of shark that is found in the Atlantic.
Canada's exports of dogfish to France grew 117% in 2001.
Demand levelled off in 2002 with the market estimated to have grown 2% to reach a value of $3.3 million.
The United States is Canada's major competitor in this market and faces the same tariff barriers.
Opportunities France will continue to import more fish and seafood as fish stocks decline, restrictions on European fisheries continue and the domestic economy recovers.
Canadian producers will encounter trade and tariff barriers, which may make other markets seem more attractive in the short term.
However, as the European Union continues to review its fisheries policies, more tariffs may be reduced or suspended.
Actual and Planned Projects The Fisheries Council (3) had to decide before December 31, 2002 on new measures to address overfishing, excess capacity of the EU fishing fleet and lack of enforcement of catch regulations.
The Council reached a series of compromises that seemed to please neither environmentalists nor European fishers.
It established allowable catches for 2003 that include substantial reductions for a number of endangered species, introduced emergency measures to protect cod stocks from extinction, and reformed the fisheries policy to provide substantial structural assistance to the sector.
To address the growing dependence of EU fish/seafood processors on imports, the European Union has temporarily suspended import duties on the following products (EU Council Regulation 2264/2002):
• lump fish with roe, fresh or chilled for processing;
• hard fish roes, fresh, chilled or frozen;
• pacific salmon, frozen and headless for processing;
• hard fish roes salted or in brine;
• pacific salmon for the processing industry for manufacture into pastes or spreads; and
• crabs (species king kegani queen snow red rough stone mus blue) simply boiled in water and shelled, whether frozen or not in immediate packing of net content 2 kg or more.
The tariff rate on dogfish fillets and meat, fresh chilled and frozen has been reduced to 6%.
In addition, tariffs on cold water shrimp have been reduced subject to quota limitations.
For prepared/preserved shrimp, Canadian producers can export up to 454 tonnes duty free, after that a 20% tariff applies.
To be entitled to a suspension or reduction in tariffs, importers must buy the product at a "free at frontier" price that is higher than the reference price.
COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT International Competition France's leading suppliers are European.
Some of these countries enjoy preferential market access because of their European Community membership (the United Kingdom, Spain, Holland and Denmark) or, as in the case of Norway, have negotiated a bilateral trading arrangement allowing them to avoid high tariffs, especially on processed seafood products.
The import seafood market has a diverse number of suppliers from around the world.
Leading seafood suppliers to France in 2001 include the United Kingdom (11%), Norway (8%), Spain (7%), Holland (6%), Denmark (5%), the United States (4%) and Madagascar (4%).
A significant 46% of the market comprised other countries.
The United States receives the same treatment as Canada with respect to tariffs and quotas, has similar proximity issues and similar seafood and fish resources.
This resource is not readily available in Canada.
Furthermore, the United States holds over 20% of French market share for imported canned salmon and 16% market share for imported dogfish.
Canadian Position Canada's main fish/seafood exports to France are scallops (43% of total Canadian exports by value), lobster (30%), dogfish (5.5%) and pike (2.6%).
Canada's fish and seafood exports grew sharply in 2001 and remained strong in 2002, despite a sluggish French economy.
The best market prospects for Canadian seafood and products are scallops, lobster, lumpfish roe, northern pike, salmon and shrimp.
Competitive Advantage Through Canadian Government Policies and Initiatives Canadian Commercial Corporation The Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC) gives Canadian companies access to financing and better payment terms under the Progress Payment Program (PPP).
The PPP concept was developed as a partnership between major Canadian financial institutions and the CCC.
It enables the exporter's bank to open a project line of credit for the exporter's benefit, based on CCC approval of the project and the exporter's ability to perform.
The CCC will also act as a prime contractor on behalf of Canadian small and medium-sized enterprises, giving those businesses increased credibility and competitive advantage.

Program for Export Market Development The Program for Export Market Development (PEMD) helps Canadian companies enter new markets by sharing the costs of activities that companies normally could not or would not undertake alone, thereby reducing risks involved in entering a foreign market.
Eligible costs and activities include market visits, trade fair participation abroad, incoming buyers, product testing for market certification, legal fees for international marketing agreements, air transportation costs of offshore company trainees, product demonstration costs and other costs necessary to execute a market development plan.
Activity costs are shared on a pre-approved, 50/50 basis.
The PEMD refundable contribution ranges from $5000 to a maximum of $50 000.
Preference is given to companies with fewer than 100 employees for a firm in the manufacturing sector and 50 in the service industry, or with annual sales between $250 000 and $10 million.
Other components of the program include international bid preparation (Capital Projects Bidding) and, for trade associations, developing international marketing activities for their membership.

Virtual Trade Commissioner The Virtual Trade Commissioner (vTC) is an on-line service offered by Canada's Trade Commissioner Service of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.
The vTC offers registered users direct on-line access to market information, including market reports, business news, events and business leads related to the companies' industry sectors and markets of interest.
Canadian exporters can register for a Virtual Trade Commissioner at http://www.infoexport.gc.ca .
PRIVATE-SECTOR CUSTOMERS French consumers most importantly want quality, health and enjoyment from food.
Yet demographics are changing.
People under 20 years of age account for a significant percentage of the population.
There is also an increase of single parents, the elderly and single young professionals living alone.
French consumers have also become increasingly concerned with food safety and the impact of the agri-food industry on the environment.
Issues facing beef producers, such as BSE and foot and mouth disease, have prompted consumers to seek alternatives to meat.
Demand for high-quality fish and seafood products, which are seen as healthy options to meat, will continue to grow.
There will also be increased pressure on fisheries to ensure that their practices are environmentally sustainable and do not damage marine habitats.
Hotels and Restaurants In 2001, French restaurants and hotels served over 6.8 billion meals with an overall value of $76 billion (4).
This market is forecast to grow at an annual rate of 4.5% for the next 3 years as new lifestyles take hold and more consumers demand quick, ready-to-eat meals.
Hotels, restaurants and other institutions account for approximately 28% of the total fish and seafood consumed in France each year.
In 2000, about half of all household and hotel and restaurant fish and seafood consumption consisted of fresh seafood.
Frozen fish and seafood accounted for 40% of hotel and restaurant consumption, and only 22% of household consumption.
Canned seafood represented almost 20% of household consumption and only 5% of hotel and restaurant consumption.
MARKET LOGISTICS Retail In 2001, 67% of fresh fish sales were through supermarkets.
The number of fishmongers in France fell from 6500 in 1987 to 3350 in 2000.
Collectively, these stores account for 75% of all retail sales.
Supermarkets are selling ready-to-eat products in an effort to take market share from the restaurant and fast-food sectors.
They also feature frozen and prepared seafood products.
Traditional fish counters account for 84% of all fresh fish sales through supermarkets and hypermarkets, and 77.5% of sales of fish portions.
Consumers are indicating a preference for time-saving fillets instead of whole fish.
They are willing to pay extra for convenience and appreciate attractive packaging.
In addition to convenience, there is also a trend to emphasize quality.
A Label Rouge certification is in place for smoked salmon to distinguish superior quality and justify premium pricing.
This system is being extended to other fish and seafood products.
Local Representatives French buyers generally prefer to purchase from an intermediary.
Direct sales are uncommon for certain products, making the choice of intermediary crucial to successful market entry.
It also gives the company that invests time and money a chance to succeed.
An exporter must weigh a number of factors when selecting a French intermediary or representative, including:
• region(s) covered;
• product knowledge;
• experience in handling the exported product;
• costs and commissions;
• what (if any) after-sales service is provided;
• size and quality of staff.
These attributes can best be assessed during a visit to France.
French law distinguishes three types of commercial distributors and attaches different duties and obligations to each status.
There are distributors, which sell products directly to customers, and two classes of sales intermediaries, which generate orders on behalf of the producer.
Under French law, these intermediaries are distributors, agents and salaried representatives.
A distributor purchases goods directly from a producer for the purpose of resale.
A distributor operates independently and is only bound by the written provisions of the distribution agreement.
It is important to have clearly specified conditions for termination.
An agreement for a specified duration may be terminated at the end of the contract period by either party without prior notice.
If termination takes place before the specified period, the terminating party may be sued for breach of contract.
Unlike distributors, agents do not purchase goods for resale.
An agent will find buyers for a product on a commission basis.
All agents exercise their activities in an independent manner and their principals are exempt from payment of payroll taxes.
An agent is free to act on behalf on any other firm.
Salaried representatives have employment contracts.
They and their employers share the burden of payroll taxes, contributing to social security, unemployment insurance/compensation and pension contributions.
The content of any foreign sales agreement is extremely important.
It is the legal basis for any relationship between the exporter and the representative.
French law can be complicated with respect to terminating an agent or distribution agreement.
Special attention should be paid to safeguarding the exporters interests should the representative's performance be unsatisfactory.
Any right to indemnification on the part of the exporter or distributor should be specified.
It is strongly advised to seek the counsel of a French lawyer.
Market-entry Considerations Suggested Business Practices There are significant cultural differences that can affect business relationships.
The French business community is quite conservative and considerably more formal.
A casual attitude could alienate French counterparts.
Attention to detail is important.
It is also expected that individuals wanting to do business in France will have some knowledge of and appreciation for French customs and culture.
The bureaucracy will also be a factor in all business conducted in France.
The French have a keen interest in technicalities.
Few businesspeople will break with established hierarchies and procedures in order to complete a deal.
Moreover, the agri-food sector is subject to numerous forms of government regulation--both national and EU-wide--and many of these regulations are politically motivated.
The only effective tool for coping with this reality is patience.
Export Regulations Canada-EU Veterinary Agreement The Government of Canada and the European Commission have agreed upon sanitary measures to protect public and animal health during the trade of live animals and animal products.
This agreement includes fish and seafood products.
It provides a mechanism for Canada and the European Union to recognize the value of their respective inspection and control systems and states that they offer an equivalent level of protection in areas of public and animal health.
Canadian Regulatory Requirements The requirements of the Fish Inspection Act and Fish Inspection Regulations apply to all commercially exported fish and seafood products marketed for human consumption.
This also includes activities that are considered processing: cleaning, filleting, icing, packing, canning, freezing, smoking, salting, cooking, pickling, drying or preparing fish in any other manner.
These regulations require that every establishment be inspected and registered.
The European Union requires all fish processing establishments exporting from Canada to have their names published on a list of establishments approved to export fish to the European Union.
This list forms Annex B of EU Directive 93/495/EEC, which lays down specific conditions for importing fishery products into the European Union from Canada.
This list is published on various Web sites maintained by the European Union.
Interested companies can contact a fish inspector at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) to be on the list.
To visit the CFIA Internet site go to http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/toce.shtml. Special Regulations In addition to the EU list, France maintains its own list of establishments that are approved to export live bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates and marine gastropods.
Canadian exports of these products must originate from an establishment registered with the CFIA.
Additional information on Canadian fish and seafood export regulations is available at http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/ fispoi/export/exporte.shtml. Import Regulations All food regulations, tariffs and quotas employed by the European Union are enforced in France.
These regulations cover ingredients, packaging, labelling and all applicable sanitary requirements.
Duties France shares all common tariff and non-tariff barriers with other EU members.
The Community Integrated Tariff (TARIC) system applies duties to imports from non-EU countries (5).
Many processed products are also levied with additional duties based on the percentage of sugar, milk, fat, milk protein and starch in the product.
In some cases, these additional charges are great enough to keep products out of the market place.
See Appendix A for tariff rates on most commonly exported Canadian seafood products.
Documentation On commercial shipments of fish and seafood products to France, the necessary documents are:
• commercial invoice;

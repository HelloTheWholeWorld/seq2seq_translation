Market Information Europe UK Fish Market Update September 2006 Edition The UK Fish Market Update is an occasional publication of the Canadian High Commission (London).
It is intended to highlight recent developments and trends in the UK fish market and to provide Canadian readers with a summary of UK fisheries import statistics and prices1(1).
Highlights If we could only bring you one snippet of information about the UK marketplace it would have to be the extraordinary rise in prominence of marine environmental issues.
Two examples from the last week alone - David Miliband, the rising Labour Party star now Minister with overall responsibility for environment, food, agriculture and fisheries mentions on his "blog" that the Marine Stewardship Council now certifies 21 fisheries; and Waitrose, the supermarket leader in fish retailing, has announced it is dropping fish caught by beam trawl as well as re-examining the sale of dredge-caught scallops.
And just last week the Marine Conservation Society published its latest guide to buying eco-friendly fish - Greenland halibut and American plaice are on the "fish to avoid" list.
Trends Major consumer trends affecting the market include ethical consumerism, healthy eating and increased eating out.
Marine environmental issues are a sub-set of ethical consumerism but the other big one right now is interest in local food.
This partly reflects an increased interest in provenance - where and how the food is produced - but also a vigorous campaign against food miles, particularly the contribution of air freight to CO2 production.
A recent YouGov survey found that 78% of consumers would like to know more about where their food comes from.
This week's stories include news of the start of fish oil supplement trial with school children to see if it affects their learning abilities, and a report about increased risk of loss of eyesight through macular degeneration in the obese.
Both of these topics should be good news for seafood sales.
Of course there are perceived health issues as well as real ones.
An example would be the obsession with fresh or chilled in the UK to the detriment of frozen.
On the shelves evidence of consumer interest in healthy products is evidenced by the success of Marks and Spencers "Eat Well" food range.
This range of nutritionally balanced, lower in salt and fat dishes, is growing at two and a half times the rate of the store's overall food business.
It is expected to make up 40% of the company's food sales within six months.
Health concerns are not confined to ready meals.
In recent years the trend in time taken to prepare the evening meal at home was ever-decreasing.
A new report by the Meat and Livestock Commission shows that it has in fact increased by 10% since 2002 with one million adults every year saying they try to eat healthy foods.
In previous reports we have talked of the steady increase in eating out.
Recent figures reveal that spending on this has overtaken the amount spent on meals at home.
In fact spending of food and drink in pubs, clubs, carry-outs and restaurants has more than doubled between 1992 and 2004.
The type of eating out has changed too.
Inexpensive restaurant chains are the most rapidly growing part of the fast food sector.
This fast-casual sector focuses on offering accessible dining to consumers willing to trade up and is succeeding while the fast-food burger market is in decline.
After months of negotiation the owners of Youngs Bluecrest were outbid for Unilever's Birds Eye by Permira, another international private equity firm.
The Irish group Kerry had reportedly also made an offer.
Youngs Bluecrest is owned by FoodVest, a subsidiary of Capvest.
There is now speculation that Permira may buy FoodVest.
The continued concentration of the salmon aquaculture industry has raised concerns in Scotland.
Pan Fish's purchase of Dutch multinational Nutreco's share of Marine Harvest has been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
It is claimed by some the deal would put 95% of Scottish salmon production under one company.
The Commission's provisional report is expected in October.
On the foodservice front the highly-acclaimed FishWorks chain of restaurants is growing apace.
Its founder, entrepreneur Mitch Tonks, started with a fishmongers store and now has thirteen restaurants, each with a fishmongers stall attached.
A number have seafood cookery schools and the group offers a seafood home delivery service too.
The overfishing investigation in the pelagic sector (see Main Species - Pelagics overleaf) resulted in the closure of Sco-Fish's pelagic plant in Fraserburgh.
However it is rumoured that the plant will reopen in time for the mackerel season on the name of Omega Fisheries.
Main Species Groundfish The big story on the groundfish market in the first half of the year was the shortage of cod coming out of Russia as a result of the ENGO campaign about illegal fishing activities in the Baltic.
The UK is of course highly import-dependant and prices rose very rapidly, peaking at the end of June/early July.
The other significant development has been the appearance of Vietnamese Pangasius on the market.
At first glance a surprising move given that the UK is not thought of as a freshwater fish market, this is as a direct result of the groundfish shortage.
Early problems of muddy flavour have apparently been overcome by improved husbandry methods.
Initially taken up by fish and chip shops, the product has also moved into the broader foodservice market.
Given the concerns of the major retail chains to sell fish from sustainable sources Panga could have a bright future here.
Pelagics The year has been interesting one for mackerel.
Last season saw all-time high prices on the back of a strong international market.
These averaged around $2520/tonne2, up from a maximum of $1470/t in 2004.
The subsequent discovery that very significant overfishing had taken place by UK and Irish vessels has led to sanctions, full details of which are yet to be confirmed.
There will be substantial clawback of UK quota by the EU Commission over several years.
Details are however still under negotiation.
Mackerel is expected to be in short supply for UK on-shore processors.
The UK fishery is divided into an early spring one and a fall one.
The spring fishery was closed early because of the overfishing investigation and the quota was reduced as a penalty.
The major part of the Total Allowable Catch has been taken, leaving only some 17,000 tonnes to be caught by UK vessels when it reopens in October.
On past experience, half the catch - that caught by Shetland vessels - could be expected to be landed direct into Norway.
However, since the opening of the Norwegian inshore fishery in August it has become apparent that Japanese and Russian buyers are still carrying stocks from last year - and refusing to pay last year's prices this season.
Initial reports are of a 20% price fall.
The main Norwegian fishery has now started and, in a reverse of the usual pattern, there are reports that some Norwegian vessels, and possibly even Danish ones, may be landing into Scotland.
The UK fall mackerel fishery is expected to run for only 3-4 weeks.
A substantial cut in the North Sea herring quota seems likely for next year with ICES scientists calling for a 40% reduction.
There is also likely to be a clawback penalty applied to UK and Irish vessels for earlier overfishing.
The 2006 summer fishery has been quite good - supplies have held up and prices at $525/t have been stronger than expected.
Crustacea and shellfish We all know that the international seafood business is a complex and sometimes surprising web.
For example 80% of shellfish landed in the UK is exported live to France, Spain and Portugal.
On the latter, prices are fairly stable after the long decline of recent years.
If anything there may be a strengthening on large size single-frozen due to shortage of supply.
On the EU Autonomous Reduced Tariff Quota, it is hoped that an increase for 2006 in the permitted tonnage, currently 7,000 tonnes/annum, will be approved shortly.
However due to the time-lag of data collection and compilation, the latest available Scottish Fish Farms Annual Production survey deals with a period before this trade action, relating instead to a time of extreme price pressure on the industry ($2.73/kg at its worst).
Product News Muller Vitality has developed the first range of functional yogurt drinks and yogurts with added Omega-3.
Fish oils are being added to all the products in the portfolio, which are already prebiotic and probiotic.
The company is supporting the range with a $21million marketing campaign.
Dawnfresh has launched a range of healthy low saturated fat and reduced salt frozen Fishbakes under its Kintyre brand.
So far there is Smoked Haddock and Broccoli, Salmon and Leek, and Cod and Mushroom with Garlic.
Modelled on the traditional New England chowder, the Scottish Shellfish Marketing Group has launched Mussel and Smoked Salmon Chowder.
The group says the aim is to make mussels and other shellfish more accessible to a wider public who may be reluctant to buy them fresh.
The product is on offer through upscale supermarket Waitrose and is one of the first results of the group's $840,000 investment in production lines.
These include Seafood Cocktail in Brine, Seafood Bites in Brine (surimi) and Norwegian Rope-grown Mussels in Brine.
The company has also launched a range of seafood snacks initially targeted at motorists through fuel stations.
New Breakers is a combination of seafood and dip in a convenient plastic pack.

Market Information Europe Agri-Food Sector Profile(1) - Belgium October 2003 Canadian Embassy in Brussels 2 Avenue de Tervueren 1040 Brussels, Belgium Contact:
Francis Keymolen, Senior Commercial Officer Tel.: (32-2) 741-0616 Fax: (32-2) 741-0606 E-mail: francis.keymolen@dfaitmaeci.gc.ca Internet: http://www.infoexport.gc.ca/be
MARKET OVERVIEW A country known for its fine cuisine and diverse cultural make-up, Belgium presents an ideal, albeit challenging, test market for agri-food products.
With a population of 10 million, the country is a manageable size for Canadian food exporters wishing to penetrate the European market.
On a per-capita basis, Belgium is the world's largest recipient of foreign investment and the third-largest foreign investor.
Due to Belgium's central European locale--nestled among France, Germany, the Netherlands and the North Sea--and its thriving food-processing industry, Belgium is an ideal centre for agri-food trade and a gateway to agri-food markets in northwestern Europe.
The food market in Belgium was valued at approximately $35.2 billion(2) in 2001, a 2% decrease over 2000.
However, the retail food sector continued to be a thriving part of the industry, with sales increasing 5% to approximately $23.2 billion.
Supermarkets accounted for nearly three-quarters of food sales in Belgium, while hypermarkets accounted for 15% and traditional and specialty stores accounted for the remaining 12%.
In 2001, Belgium imported a total of $24.4 billion of agri-food products, of which fish and seafood products accounted for 6%.
Popular imports included refined sugar, specialty cheese, bananas, processed fruits and vegetables, snack foods, grape wines, and wheat.
Prominent fish and seafood imports included crustaceans, accounting for 36% of fish and seafood imports, followed by groundfish and flatfish (27%), and molluscs (10%).
There are a number of factors that affect the demand for agri-food products in Belgium.
Belgians have become increasingly health-conscious, as a result of food safety scares such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and the spread of avian influenza in a number of birds.
Consequentially, demand for health and organic foods is expected to continue to grow.
Belgians also like to eat out in restaurants and are increasingly looking for convenience foods and ready-to-eat-meals.
While most Belgians will pay high prices for products, quality is also a decision-making factor for the typical consumer.
The quality of private labels has improved over the years, and as a result, the market for private labels has grown by 3% since 1997.
In 2002, private labels accounted for nearly half of the frozen foods market and 30% of retail sales.
OPPORTUNITIES The willingness of the Belgian consumer to adopt new food items into their diverse cuisine makes Belgium a prospective target market for Canadian exporters.
The best market opportunities for Canadian companies lie with the current food trends (e.g. private label, health and organic foods) and Canadian specialty products (e.g. wild rice, specialty meats, confectionery goods).
Other products that represent strong commercial potential include:
• seafood
• fresh fruit and vegetables
• dried fruits
• nuts
• wine
• fruit juices
• ready-to-eat meals
• specialty foods (e.g. kosher food) Canadian exporters are recommended to appoint a local agent or partner with a local importer to penetrate the Belgian market.
As importers typically focus on specific product categories, they are well equipped to advise exporters on importing, packaging and labelling guidelines.
Furthermore, many Belgium importers also act as distributors and wholesalers.
Canadian exporters will also find good opportunities to meet prospective buyers at food tradeshows.
For example, many Belgian buyers, European Union (EU) food companies and supermarkets visit two of the largest food events in Europe--Sial (France) and Anuga (Germany).

KEY PARTICIPANTS Due to Belgium's favourable geographic location, many multinational food-processing companies have established their European headquarters in the country, largely by acquiring traditional food-processing plants.
Only one-third of food-processing companies in Belgium are still Belgian-owned.
The French industry holds another third, while the United States controls approximately one-quarter, and the remaining companies are primarily Dutch-, British- or German-owned.
The majority of food imports in Belgium come from other EU countries, particularly France, the Netherlands, Germany and Italy.
However, Belgium remains open to many new food products, as evidenced by the scope of its remaining global imports.
Many international specialty items have been successfully incorporated into the domestic cuisine.
Canadian Position Belgium ranks as Canada's ninth-largest trading partner, with Canadian exports to Belgium totalling $1.9 billion in 2002.
Canadian agri-food exportst amounted to $341.4 million, accounting for almost 20% of total exports to Belgium.
Top Canadian agri-food exports to the country included linseed, mustard seed, canary seed, bovine, sheep and goat fats, wheat and meslin and soya beans.
Canadian exporters have also had success in exporting dairy products to Belgium, such as cheese and powdered milk as well as whiskies and grape wines.
In 2002, Canadian agri-food products accounted for just over 1% of the total Belgian agri-food imports.
PRIVATE- SECTOR CUSTOMERS A host of distribution channels exist for the Belgian food market, including retail chains, cash and carry, wholesalers' purchasing groups, and franchises (including restaurants).
The key customers in Belgium's agri-food industry are retailers, wholesalers and importers/distributors who purchase products for many of these distribution channels simultaneously.
France's Carrefour is the largest retailer in Belgium with a 26% market share.
The local supermarket operator Delhaize Le Lion is the second largest retail chain accounting for 25% of market share, followed by Colruyt (13%) Aldi (10%) and Louis Delhaize (8%).
Canadian agri-food exporters seeking to introduce their products to the Belgian and European markets must ensure that the contents of their products fall within European Commission guidelines.
For example, meat, poultry and game products must follow a very stringent hormone policy, allowing neither treatment with synthetic products nor organic hormones.
For processed foods and confectioneries, strict regulations govern the use of preservatives, flavouring, emulsifiers, stabilizers, thickeners and gelling agents, colouring matters and anti-oxidants.
In Belgium, all packaging information must be given in French, Flemish (Dutch) and/or German, depending on the language used in the region in which the product will be sold.
As with any other food market, the strict importation and labelling/packaging guidelines should be consulted before a market strategy is established.
Tariffs (ad valorem basis) should also be examined, as they can vary widely both between and within food product categories.

MARKET OVERVIEW The Croatian economy has shown steady growth over the last few years.
Croatia's gross domestic product (GDP) has averaged 3-4% since 2000 and is forecast to remain at this level in 2003.
Agriculture and fishing generate 7.1% of Croatian GDP, while production of food, beverages and tobacco generates almost 20%.
Croatia has a total of 3.15 million hectares of agricultural land, of which about 64% is cultivated.
81.5% of the cultivated land and more than 80% of the total livestock are privately owned.
Cattle production is 30% lower than before the transition to a market economy in 1990.
With its various climatic zones--continental, Mediterranean and mountainous--conditions are favourable for production of a wide range of agricultural products from wines, fruits and vegetables.
Croatia is a relatively small market, with a population of 4.4 million.
On average, 30% of the household budget is spent on food and non-alcoholic beverages.
Agricultural and food products make approximately 18% of the country's total international trade.
Croatia remains a net food importer, with 2001 imports totaling $898(2) million while exports totaled $565 million.
Croatia imports significant amounts of soybeans, flowers, fruits and vegetables, milk, oil plants and breeding cattle.
Imported food products include animal feed, meat, chewing gums, soft drinks and malt.
The majority of imports originate from Austria, Italy, Germany and Slovenia.
Major Croatian food export products are food seasoning, soups, confectionery, canned fish, fresh tuna (for Japanese market), canned beef, olive oil, cigarettes, beer and alcoholic beverages, mandarins and eggs.
The most important export destinations are the markets of neighbouring countries, Slovenia, Bosnia Herzegovina and Serbia and Montenegro, Macedonia, Italy.
Croatia has free trade agreements with most of its trading partners and joined the World Trade Organization in 2000.
In February 2003, Croatia applied for membership in the European Union and is expected to accede as early as 2007.
OPPORTUNITIES Opportunities for Canadian exporters in the agricultural products area include a Croatian demand for grains, animal feed, pork and beef, fish and seafood, pulses, breeding swine and cattle.
Imports of processed foods are also required, including specialty foods for hotels, snacks, health and organic foods, and food ingredients.
Croatia is still in the privatization process, which creates opportunities in the food processing and agricultural machinery and technology industries.
Croatia provides Canadian exporters with access to a wider market, including the markets of Slovenia (also an EU accession candidate), Bosnia Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro, and Macedonia.
In addition, Croatia is heavily dependant on its tourist industry and welcomes about 6.5 million tourists per year.
The food services and processing industry looks for imports to suit its international clientele during the May-September tourist season.
Trade Shows
Features gastronomy, wine and wine equipment, food and beverages, agriculture (http://www.zv.hr)
KEY PARTICIPANTS There is a minimal existing Canadian presence on the market, due to little knowledge of Canadian products and technologies in the local market.
However, Canadian companies active in the market include McCain Foods (New Brunswick), Agro-Haribec (Brossard, Quebec), Seemex Alliance (Guelph, Ontario) and Maple Leaf Foods (Toronto, Ontario), Export Packers (Toronto, Ontario) and Cuddy Farms (Strathroy, Ontario).
Companies from neighbouring EU countries, particularly Austria, Germany and Italy, have a traditionally strong presence in this market.
These companies enjoy preferred import tariffs, given to all EU members and countries of the Central European Free Trade Agreement.
Furthermore, in many cases, the Croat regulatory environment is already in compliance with EU standards, facilitating Croatia-EU trade.
PRIVATE- AND PUBLIC-SECTOR CUSTOMERS Considering the size of the market, there is a large number of European supermarket chains present in the Croatian grocery food market.
Most have a presence in at least 3 urban centers.
It is important to find distributors/agents that have access to at least one supermarket chain.
The largest player in the market is the domestic chain called Konzum.
The key customers of agricultural machinery are farm machinery wholesalers and retailers, hardware and gardening equipment retailers, and farmers.
Agricultural machinery is normally distributed through importers/agents, dealers, distributors or directly to end-users.
Most distribution is centralised in the capital city of Zagreb where one-quarter of the population lives.
Generally countrywide coverage can be provided by distributing firms headquartered in Zagreb.
Many have representatives in at least one other urban centre and cover the surrounding region.
For a list of Croatian companies in this sector, please contact the Canadian Embassy in Zagreb.

This report is intended as a concise overview of the market for those interested in its potential and is not intended to provide in-depth analysis which may be required by the individual exporter.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY After the United States, Germany is the largest market for additives and ingredients in the world.
Weak pricing is expected to erode profit margins as inexpensive Asian products enter the international market.
Volume growth will outpace market value in most food ingredient segments, except in functional and organic ingredients and natural colourings or foodstuffs.
Increasing demand for these products, which are forecast to grow 4.5% annually over the next five years, is the result of several important trends in German society.
German consumers are placing more importance on nutrition, preventative health and consumer protection in their purchasing habits.
They are also concerned about environmentally sound land-management and farming practices.
These trends are reflected in the German government's 2002 agri-food policy report.
MARKET OVERVIEW Germany is the world's third-largest economy and the largest market in the European Union (EU)3.
With a gross domestic product (GDP) estimated at $3.2 trillion, Germany accounts for close to one third of the GDP of the euro-zone4.
With a population of 82 million people and the average per-capita income approaching $40 000 a year, Germany has one the highest standards of living in the world.
Yet in recent years, the German economy has not performed well.
In the last quarter of 2002, economic growth was flat.
Following growth of 0.6% in 2001, the economy grew a only 0.2% in 2002.
Low growth rates are believed to be the result of a steady decline in consumer spending and business investment, combined with weakening exports.
Significant economic recovery will be dependant on improvement in the global economy and increased demand for German exports.
Private consumption within Germany is forecast to remain depressed.
The forward-looking indicators point to continued economic weakness: in 2003, GDP growth is forecast to be 0.4%.
Germany is a leading trading nation in agricultural products and has considerable influence in the formulation of EU regulations and the EU Common Agriculture Policy (CAP).
It is Canada's fourth-largest export market.
In 2002, total Canadian agri-food exports to Germany were valued at over $240 million.
Because the food ingredients sector has such a low profile, it has proven difficult to define and, in turn, to measure.
Sources differ as to the size of the market, primarily due to different definitions of the product portfolio.
Leatherhead Food International places conservative estimates of the value of the German additive and ingredients market at $6 billion.
Leatherhead Food International divided the 2001 German market for food additives into the following segments: flavours, 30%; hydrocollids, 17%; acidulants, 13%; flavour enhancers, 12%; sweeteners, 6%; colours, 5%; emulsifiers, 5%; vitamins and minerals, 5%; enzymes, 4%; chemical preservatives, 2%; and anti-oxidants, 1%.
Over the next five years, annual growth is projected to be between 2% and 3% per year.
Weak pricing is expected to erode margins as inexpensive Asian products enter the international market.
Volume growth will outpace market value in most food ingredient segments.
The exceptions to this trend will be in functional and organic ingredients, and colouring foodstuffs.
These products can bridge traditional segments.
Key Factors Shaping Market Growth Three key factors- product safety, environmental protection and innovation- affect market growth in Germany.
German consumers are well-informed and deeply concerned about nutrition and product safety.
They are aware of food additives, read labels and demand a lot of information about the products they consume.
Recent adverse publicity about food safety (e.g. acrylamide found in high-starch snack food and banned antibiotics found in some imports of shrimp and sausage ingredients from China) has led to even more intense scrutiny.
Adverse publicity can have long-term consequences for product marketability and may even spread further to affect the reputation of an entire country's agri-food sector.
German consumers are also very concerned about their natural environment.
They want food that has been produced and packaged in an environmentally sensitive manner.
This is true even at the industrial level, where food processors will insist that imported ingredients are shipped in recyclable bags and on pulpable skids.
The food processing and food ingredients industries in Germany are highly developed and sophisticated.
In this market, as in any mature market, innovation drives growth.
German consumers appreciate quality and taste and are always looking for new and healthier foods and beverage choices.
Regulatory Environment Defining Functional A functional ingredient is an ingredient that claims to give a positive health benefit.
Examples of functional ingredients are probiotics (bacteria that aid digestion) and calcium (when added to orange juice can help prevent osteoporosis).
In Germany, as in Canada, food products can not claim to have direct therapeutic effects.
Marketing of functional foods has therefore needed to be creative, inferring a health benefit without actually stating it.
This also creates fluidity between functional and enhanced foods.
The European Food Authority is drafting a legislative proposal to regulate health claims that can be made on food packaging.
A draft of the legislation is currently under review and is expected to come gradually into force by 2005.
At present, there is no legal definition or formal medical authorization required in order to make a positive health claim.
Also there are differing degrees of regulation throughout the European Union member states.
The uncertainty of the regulatory framework is a factor that is limiting growth in this sector.
Common Agriculture Policy The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is a major factor determining the composition of Canadian agri-food imports to Germany.
Through the CAP, the European Union has established a system of common prices, marketing aids, production, storage arrangements, import controls, export restitutions and specialization of production.
The German Agri-food Policy Report 2002 calls for profound revision and re-direction of the CAP.
The German government wants to place more emphasis on consumer protection, organic farming and environmental protection.
It is not clear, however, if the German government wants to end its system of subsidies and protection.
Genetically Modified Organisms The moratorium on approving and importing genetically modified (GM) products was lifted throughout the European Union in October 2002.
However, GM foods are very slow to find their way to the market due to the enforcement of labelling and traceability rules.
In November 2002, the Agriculture Council of the European Union agreed by a majority decision that food containing more than 0.9% GM material will have to be labelled as containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
The Council also agreed that labelling of GM material in food should be extended to include food or ingredients produced with GM crops.
The proposal calls for complete transparency for the consumer and the ability to trace every GMO back to the farm on which it was grown.
The agreement will have to go before European Parliament before any legislation can come into effect.
It is important to note that while EU regulations on GM foods may appear to function as trade barriers, these regulations are in response to public pressure.
German consumers have made it very clear that they do not want to consume GM food or beverages.
Opportunities Canadian producers offering innovative, high-quality products should find a receptive market in the following categories.
Organic Ingredients Organic food products are one of the fastest-growing segments of the German food industry and present important opportunities for Canadian exporters in the ingredients sector.
Canadian companies can build on Canada's solid reputation in Europe for quality and traceability in the organic sector, especially in soy beans.
In 2001, Germany introduced a logo for organic food products.
This new logo - officially dubbed the Bio-Siegel - replaced a private-industry label and conforms to EU organic market regulations (EEC 2092/91).
Functional Ingredients The functional foods market in Germany was valued at $1.3 billion in 2002 and is forecast to account for 20% of the German food and drinks market by 2010.
Probiotic products account for close to 80% of the drinking yogurt market and 20% of the fruit yogurt market.
In any high-growth sector, there is accompanying risk.
The recent launch of Unilever's pro becel active, a margarine spread that the company claims will lower cholesterol, quickly became the subject of controversy: only registered drugs are allowed to make this kind of specific claim.
Yet, many market analysts remain convinced that even with the uncertain and shifting regulatory environment, demand for functional food and beverages will continue to grow.
Market research indicates that German consumers want healthy choices and that they prefer to get their nutrients from food rather than supplements and pills.
Germany is expected to sustain a small trade deficit in bulk nutrients and minerals and will continue to rely on imports of amino acids.
This trade deficit has not gone unnoticed by companies working to take advantage of these opportunities.
Germany-based Amino GmbH has introduced a full line of food-grade amino acids derived from beet sugar molasses.
Omega Tech, a leading producer of fatty acids headquartered in the United States, has opened a research facility in Germany and Celanese Ventures, operating out of Frankfurt, has commercialized a naturally occurring micro-algae that is used to fortify food and beverages.
Canadian producers are in a position to take advantage of their strong capacity in phytosterols (cholesterol lowering ingredients), probiotics (fax/yeasts) and soy.
Producers should ensure that all claims of health benefits derived from their products are supported by sufficient scienctific evidence.
Producers interested in exporting functional ingredients to Germany are advised to ensure that their ingredients can be imported into Germany as foodstuffs under the agricultural regulatory framework.
Colouring Foodstuffs Colouring foodstuffs include fruit and vegetable juices (dried, concentrated and powdered extracts).
Examples of Canadian products that could be used for colouring are blueberry or cranberry concentrates.
Colouring foodstuffs do not contain carriers or additives and may be listed as ingredients.
Thus, they are not E-numbered5 food additives.
The total European food colours market was valued at $332 million in 2001.
While natural colouring foodstuffs represents a smaller portion of this market, it is projected to grow 10-15% per year through 2008.
When and if current health claims of some colouring foodstuffs are substantiated, this will promote further growth in this segment.
Actual and Planned Projects The Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) is responsible for approving the use of food additives in the European Union.
The system was introduced to facilitate identification.
However, additives such as enzymes, processing aids and colouring foodstuffs are not included in the E-number system.
The system, which was intended to promote clarity, has been widely criticized as confusing.
Moreover, in Germany E-numbers have actually become a stigma.
Many German consumers indicate that they believe substances requiring an E-number are unsafe.
In January 2003, the EU Environment Committee called for a review of the safety level for food additives used in confectionery, soft drinks and snacks that are consumed in larger quantities by children and adolescents.
The Committee also voted unanimously in favour of a report banning the use of the additive konjac (E425) in confectionery.
In 2002, the European Commission compiled a register of all flavouring substances authorized in different EU member states.
It has also attempted to indicate prohibitive measures that exist in certain member states, in an attempt toward harmonizing regulations that have, in effect, served as trade barriers.
This list can be downloaded from http://www.europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sfp/addit_flavor/flav17_en.pdf. There is also an amendment to harmonize the authorization of food additives in the European Union.
These amendments are not expected to be applied throughout the European Union before 2006.
The text of the amendment can be downloaded from http://www.europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sfp/addit_flavor/ additives/proposal_2002_0662_en.pdf.
COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT Local Capabilities Germany has a well-developed food ingredients industry and is one of the world's mostactive developers of nutrients and functional ingredients.
There are also large multinational corporations that have significant local operations in Germany, such as Novartis and BASF.
In addition, there are numerous small and mid-sized companies that are very active in this industry.
Germany's leading ingredients producers include Sudzucker, Degussa and Haarmann & Reimer, which together saw sales in excess of $9.8 billion in 2001 (see Table 1).
International Competition EU exporters are in a better position to supply German food processors than non-EU exporters.
In addition to benefitting from the time and cost advantages of geographical proximity, products from EU countries are not subject to tariffs.
Canadian Position Canada's presence in the market is small.
Canadian exports of products destined as inputs for Germany's food processing sector were estimated to be over $23 million in 2002.
Top exports included wild blueberries, mustard preparations and mustard flour, oil seeds (flax, mustard, sunflower) and cocoa preparations.
Shipping costs and tariffs put Canadian manufacturers at a disadvantage when attempting to compete in the German market on the basis of price.
Canada's comparative advantage lies in the ability to provide high-quality and innovative products.
New Exporters to Overseas The New Exporters to Overseas (NEXOS) program helps Canadian companies that have not yet exported to Europe.
NEXOS introduces the essentials of exporting and provides practical information and first-hand exposure to European markets.
The program emphasizes information in areas such as customs procedures, market access, shipping, labelling, distribution channels and currency regulations.
Flexibility and fast turnaround times are the hallmarks of this program.
Individual companies are advised to work with a Canadian organization such as an industry association, chamber of commerce, international trade centre or provincial government to assemble a group of at least six companies on whose behalf a program can be arranged.
The mission is usually built around an event such as a national or international trade fair.
Participants are responsible for their own transportation, accommodation and living expenses.
NEXOS will cover associated program expenses such as meeting rooms, speakers and local transportation.
Canadian firms must be registered with the Trade Commissioner Service to be eligible to participate.
Contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT), European Business Development Section (REB) for more information about NEXOS.
Through a personalized and password-protected Web page, vTC-registered Canadian exporters will receive timely and relevant information on contacts and business opportunities in targeted foreign markets.
MARKET LOGISTICS The distribution system within Germany is highly efficient and contains various channels to ensure speedy delivery of products.
Germans take pride in their efficiency, and it is therefore not surprising that the costs associated with the distribution of food products within the country are relatively low.
Germany's location, combined with its existing distribution channels, also make it a good base from which to ship products to other countries.
Channels of Distribution By law, the German importer has legal liability for imported products marketed in Germany.
Therefore, the importer has an important incentive to work well with foreign suppliers to ensure that products meet all regulatory requirements.
Finding the right partner can make all the difference when trying to enter the German market.
Direct Sales Large multinational food processing companies, as well as companies that produce functional foods, may purchase directly from suppliers.
However, most food processors prefer to deal with a local agent/distributor, who is better able to provide after sales and follow-up service.
Exporters should note that it may be necessary to use more than one distributor or agent in order to ensure national distribution.
When seeking the services of a distributor or wholesaler, exporters should consider the relationship that these individuals have with local governments, buyers and banks; the condition of their facilities; and their willingness and ability to keep inventory.
Canadian producers are advised to review the provisions of German/EU law with a qualified lawyer before entering into an agreement with a prospective partner.
Agents and Sales Representatives Working with an agent is also an excellent way to introduce a new product into the German market.
While agents solicit business and enter into agreements on behalf of the exporter, they do not take ownership of the products they sell.
An exporter must weigh a number of factors when selecting an agent, including:
• reputation;
• product knowledge;
• experience in handling the exported product;
• commission to be paid;
• what (if any) after-sales service is provided;
• track record; and
• size and quality of the agent's staff.
These attributes can best be assessed during a visit to Germany.
Manufacturers should also ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined before entering into a long-term relationship.
Joint Ventures Pursuing a joint venture or strategic alliance can be a successful strategy for Canadian producers of functional ingredients.
There is a wide range of food processors who are looking to include functional foods and beverages in their product portfolios.
Co-branding - whereby an established food processor will partner with a functional ingredient producer and introduce the logo of the ingredient on its packaging- has proven to be a successful strategy to add value to an existing product.
Market-entry Considerations Suggested Business Practices Germans have a well-deserved reputation for precision.
All aspects of conducting business, from arriving on time for a meeting to carrying out the details of a contract, are important.
Germans generally do not appreciate exaggeration and insist on data to support all claims.
This preference for facts over emotion is also seen in advertising.
Factual information dominates opinion.
Personal relationships also tend to be separate from business relationships.
Canadian exporters may need years of contact with German counterparts before more personal relationships develop.
The German bureaucracy and regulatory environment can also pose significant challenges.
Moreover, European Union attempts to harmonize the regulations and standards of member states creates further complications.
To the extent to which EU standards are developed, there is a high probability, especially in agriculture, that the existing German standard will be its basis.
In many instances, Germany will be the first country to implement newly enacted EU regulations.
Canadian companies are advised to know precisely which EU or German standards and regulations apply to their products.
German consumers also demand additional quality certifications that may not be legally required but may greatly improve a product's marketability.
An example of this is the Duales System Deutschland or "green dot."
The green dot on a package signifies that packaging is environmentally considerate: minimalist, recyclable and made from recycled materials.
Evidence of a Canadian company's long-term commitment is important.
German businesspeople appreciate foreign exporters who are willing to make this commitment and tend to be wary of those who appear interested only short-term goals or dumping excess production.
New products generally require 12-18 months before success can be assessed accurately.
In addition, German importers and distributors expect adequate after-sales support, regardless of the exporter's distance from the market.
Providing this kind of support will help Canadian producers to overcome proximity disadvantages with respect to EU competitors.
Canadian producers are strongly advised to attend food ingredients trade fairs in Germany and other European countries (see Promotional Events).
The trade fairs will give those Canadian producers who are unfamiliar with German and European markets a sense of the business culture and the different ways products are presented and marketed.
For Canadian exporters presently active in the German market, trade fairs are an excellent opportunity to increase visibility and local contacts.
Import Regulations As a member of the European Union, Germany follows the Community Integrated Tariff (TARIC) system, which applies duties to all imports from non-EU countries.
EU/German import regulations, duties and tariff-rate quotas protect domestic industries by limiting the range of foreign products entering the market.
Combined with transportation costs, these factors usually result in Canadian products being higher-priced.
Product-specific TARIC information can be obtained from the EU tariff database at http://europa.eu.int/comm/taxation_customs/dds/en/tarhome.htm. Value-added tax (VAT) is applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all goods and most services.
The tax is levied at the time of customs clearance for all imported goods and is currently 16%.
There is a reduced rate of 7% for some agricultural products.
Canadian companies should consult with customs officials to confirm import tax rates on their products.
Germany uses the Harmonized System (HS) to classify goods for international trade.
An importer must have an HS number to determine the amount of duty required.
In order to clear customs, goods must be accompanied by the proper shipping documents, bill of lading (or air waybill) and a detailed commercial invoice.
Local Standards, Certificates or Registrations All products exported to Germany must be accompanied by a standard set of shipping documents.
Due to the complexity of German/EU regulations, Canadian exporters should request any additional information from the importer prior to shipping.
It is recommended that Canadian exporters use the services of a German customs broker, importer, agent or distributor to ensure that all essential documentation is correctly prepared and arrives with the shipment.
All documents should be completed in both German and English to avoid unnecessary delays.
Commercial Invoice The commercial invoice serves as a bill to the buyer from the exporter and must accompany every shipment to Germany.
Invoices should be thoroughly checked, since any error or omission can result in delays, fines or even confiscation.
Invoices must include the following information:
• place and date of issue;
• names and addresses of importer and exporter;
• detailed description of the merchandise, including identifying marks, quantities in units customary to international trade), numbers and varieties;
• method of shipment;
• signature, name and title of responsible officer;
• all insurance and freight charges; and
• shipper's invoice number and customer's order number.
Exporters should consult with their customs broker to determine how many copies of the commercial invoice should be sent with each shipment, since the number required varies according to the product being shipped.
Any promotional information should also be included with the commercial invoice.
Export Declaration Form For statistical purposes, Canada requires exporters to complete an Export Declaration (Form B-13A), which can be filed electronically at http://www.ccraadrc.gc.ca/E/pbg/cf/b13abp/README.html. Although exporters are technically responsible, agents, brokers or carriers typically complete and submit the form on behalf of the exporter.
Packing List A packing list is necessary when multiple packages are shipped, unless the commercial invoice provides the required information.
This list should include:
• the number of packages within one case;
• the net, gross and legal weights of each case, and of the total shipment; and
• the volume of individual packages, as well as of the shipment as a whole.
Between four and seven copies of the packing list should be included in any shipment, depending on the product being shipped.
Bill of Lading The bill of lading is the shipper's recognition of receipt of the shipment.
Each shipment may contain a set of bills of lading, one copy of which should be kept on file, while other copies are sent to the importer and customs broker, respectively.
The bill of lading should include:
• description of the product(s);
• weights and measurements of the packages and their types;
• ports of origin and destination;
• names and addresses of shipper, importer and customs broker;
• any freight or other charges incurred;
• number of bills of lading in the full set; and
• carrier's acknowledgment of receipt "on board" of the goods for shipment.
Depending on the product, it may be necessary for exporters to include storage temperature and other storage requirements on the bill(s) of lading.
Certificate of Origin A certificate of origin verifies that the goods originate in Canada and are therefore subject to all duties or taxes that apply to Canadian products.
Packaging and Labelling It is recommended that Canadian exporters examine both German and European Union regulations regarding packaging and labelling standards.
All imported agri-food labels must include:
• name of the product;
• statement of what the product is;
• expiry date and any other storage requirements;
• alcohol content, by volume (when applicable);
• manufacturer's lot or batch number;
• all nutritional information;
• list of ingredients and weights in metric units; and
• list of additives, preservatives or colouring used.
EU regulations on the use and labelling of novel food additives can be downloaded from http://europa.eu.int/eur-lex/pri/en/oj/dat/2000/l_006/l_00620000111en00150017.pdf. See also the Appendix for a list of EU regulations on food and food additives.
Authentication of Documents Documents that need to be authenticated, such as certificates of sale and letters authorizing an exporter's local agent or importer to act on their behalf, must first be notarized in Canada.
Exporters can have the notarized documents authenticated, at no cost, by sending them to the Authentication and Services of Documents (JLAC) at the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.
Export Credit Risks, Restrictions on Letters of Credit, Currency Controls Germany implements no restrictions on letters of credit or currency controls.
Generally, the method of payment is a matter for negotiation between the individual supplier and importer.
Usual practice is for payment to be made by terms of a letter of credit for 30- 60 days.
In cases where distribution arrangements are concluded, exporters are advised to prepare a contract detailing all major points of agreement, rights and responsibilities.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The Netherlands has the fifth-largest biotechnology industry in Europe.
There are approximately 300 companies in the Netherlands involved in biotechnology; together, these companies saw a turnover valued at $150 million(1) in 2002.
The open dialogue among government, industry and consumers has resulted in strict but effective legislation for biotechnology, which provides a high level of safety for animals, humans and the environment.
Dutch consumers are generally well-informed about the pros and cons of biotechnology, particularly with regard to food.
Environmental and consumer groups in the Netherlands judge issues on a case-by-case basis, as opposed to groups in other parts of Europe, which tend to reject biotechnology as a matter of principal.
Dutch strengths include diagnostics and therapeutics, plant biotechnology and environmental biotechnology.
By 2010, the health-care sector may account for 34% of all biotech output in the Netherlands, while the food and agricultural biotech sector should experience dramatic growth and may account for 25-30% of the sector.
Currently, however, environmental biotech output exceeds agriculture.
The most significant opportunities for Canadian biotech firms are in collaborative research partnerships and technology transfer agreements in these sectors.
In addition, there will be a growing need for companies offering equipment, support services and technical experience to supply the market as the biotech industry in the Netherlands matures and expands.
MARKET OVERVIEW With an estimated value of $150 million, the Netherlands has the fifth-largest biotech industry in Europe behind the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Sweden.
Approximately 300 companies in the Netherlands are involved in biotechnology, employing a total of 1500-2000 people.
By 2010, the health-care sector may account for 34% of all biotech output in the Netherlands, while the food and agricultural biotech sector may experience dramatic growth and account for 20-30% of the sector that year.
Indeed, the industry is known to have an open and constructive dialogue with social organizations and environmental groups concerning the introduction of new biotech products.
The Netherlands has also developed strong regulatory structures, including strict but workable legislation for biotechnology that focusses on human and animal health safety, as well as environmental protection.
The Dutch biotech industry is globally oriented in general and is highly supportive of forming international partnerships.
Many foreign companies have based their European headquarters in the Netherlands, benefitting not only from a positive climate for biotechnology, but also the country's excellent transport and information technology infrastructures and its favourable tax climate.
Agricultural and Food Biotechnology The agriculture and food biotech industry in the Netherlands is concentrated in the Wageningen Food Valley.
This area is renown for strong government funding as well as quality research and educational institutions.
Activity is focussed on plant genomics, agronomic research and, to a lesser extent due to public opposition, veterinary research, which is generally concentrated in Utrecht.
Scientists in Wageningen have also developed expertise in functional foods, particularly sport-related food and drink, the role of anti-oxidants in food and human health, and the role of micronutrients.
Unlike in other European countries, genetically modified (GM) crops and food products are not a significant topic of public debate in the Netherlands.
The traditional Dutch "Polder model" of consultation has ensured that interested parties on both sides of the GM debate have amicable discussions and keep each other abreast of new issues.
As a result, government and industry organizations actively encourage the development and marketing of novel foods, both in safety assessment and product labelling procedures.
In response, Microscreen, a Dutch-owned biotech company, and TNO, a domestic research organization, have developed monitoring and testing systems for food products.
Leading local companies include BaseClear, BioDetection Systems, CatchMabs BV, Cellscreen BV, Keygene N.V., Plant Research International B.V. and TNO.
Agricultural biotechnology is also researched at Greenomics (a Plant Research International B.V. facility and part of Wageningen University and Research Centre), Groningen Biomolecular Sciences and Biotechnology Institute (GBB) and the Graduate School Vlag.
Foreign participants in the agricultural and food sectors include Biotechnology Application Centre BV, a subsidiary of Unilever, and Bio-Rad Laboratories, a Dutch subsidiary of California-based Bio-Rad Labs.
Chemical Biotechnology The chemicals sector is also embracing biotechnology, as evidenced by the growing number of companies focussing production on high added-value products such as raw materials for agro-chemicals and drugs.
Research in the Netherlands with regard to chemicals tends to focus on enzymes.
Dutch-owned DSM, for example, is using GM moulds as a cost-saving measure in the production of raw substances used to make antibiotics.
Biocatalysis research is also broad, ranging from basic to applied research.
In 2002, researchers from five universities and several publically funded institutes were engaged in biocatalysis research.
The chemicals sector had an estimated value of $35.4 billion in 2000.
Biotechnology accounted for 12-18% of turnover that year, a percentage that is expected to increase to 25% by 2010.
Environmental Biotechnology The Netherlands is highly susceptible to pollution.
The country is densely populated (16 million people) and has both a huge chemical industry and an intensive agriculture and livestock farming industry.
The fact that much of the Netherlands is below sea level makes it vulnerable to pollution, as does its position at the estuary of the Rhine and Meuse rivers, which bring contaminants from the highly industrialized countries of Germany, Switzerland, France and Belgium.
Pollution control and environmental protection are key national priorities and the population has a high level of environmental awareness.
Environmental biotechnology is one of the most advanced areas of research in the Netherlands.
Dutch universities are conducting research into various types of bacteria with the ability to break down pollutants.
Research also focusses on the recovery of primary raw materials.
Polluted ground, including dredged material from rivers, is a major problem in the Netherlands, however - one that invites solutions from Canadian companies with new and innovative technologies.
Leading domestic companies include BioDetection Systems, CatchMabs BV, Cellscreen BV and TNO.
The public research infrastructure consists of a network of research schools and institutes including the Graduate Research School of Biotechnological Sciences Delft Leiden, BioCentrum Amsterdam (joint venture of the University of Amsterdam and the Vrije Universiteit), Hubrecht Laboratorium (Utrecht University), Noordelijke Hogeschool Leeuwarden and the Van Hall Instituut.
Bio-Rad Laboratories is also active in the field.
Medical/Pharmaceutical Biotechnology Biopharmaceuticals are the primary strength of the Dutch biotech industry.
As the science behind biotechnology develops, many traditional pharmaceutical companies are turning their attention to the potential of biotech processes and biopharmaceuticals.
The industry, however, does not distinguish between biopharmaceuticals and pharmaceuticals.
In 2001, the Dutch pharmaceuticals market was valued at $7.8 billion or $469.48 per capita.
Average annual growth in the Dutch pharmaceuticals markets is approximately 10%.
The generics market grew at a faster rate than the pharmaceuticals market as a whole, at 15% in 2001.
The slowest-growing segment of the market was hospitalprescribed drugs, which grew by only 2% in 2001.
Prescription drugs accounted for the vast majority of the market, with over-the-counter (OTC) drugs accounting for approximately 12%.
Most medicines consumed in the Netherlands are imported.
The Netherlands has a strong position in the global market for niche, biotech-related pharmaceuticals.
Over 60 biotech medicines are on the market currently.
An important source of knowledge for medical biotechnology is the rapidly developing field of genomics.
Of the 50-plus biotech companies active in health care, AkzoNobel, along with its subsidiaries Organon, Diosynth and Intervet, is the leading domestic leader in the development of biotech pharmaceuticals.
Other leading domestic companies include Crucell, IsoTis, Gene Pharming, Primagen Holding, Rhein Biotech NV, Quiagen and Jari Pharmaceuticals BV.
Key Factors Shaping Market Growth Currently, the Netherlands ranks tenth in Europe in total number of biotech start-up companies.
The Dutch government would like to see the Netherlands rise to the top few countries and is, therefore, encouraging growth in the biotech sector.
The BioPartner Network assists spin-off and start-up companies by providing funding, through subsidies and risk capital, as well as facilities to new companies.
The BioPartner Network currently supports groups and individuals focussed on molecular diagnostics, production of medicinal proteins in nectar and honey and bioresolutions for the fine-chemical industry.
Factors shaping the consumption and pricing of pharmaceuticals in the Netherlands include growing government pressure to contain health-care costs, an ageing population, the emergence of new products, the shift from curative to preventative health care, and the shift from institutional to out-patient care.
As a result of these factors, the market is expected to change significantly over the next several years.
For example, by 2005, the number of persons over the age of 65 will increase by over 20%; the number of persons over the age of 80 will increase by 33%.
By 2005, fully one third of the population will be over 50 years of age.
As the population ages, demand for pharmaceuticals will likely increase.
Public Opinion Issues Unlike in other European countries, there has not been a strong public outcry against biotechnology and genetically altered food products in the Netherlands.
There has been some resistance to the introduction of food products without labels, but the industry has not faced the violence and negative publicity seen in other countries.
In general, the Dutch accept biotech products that are beneficial to human health or the environment, but have a strongly negative opinion of technology that raises ethical issues or involves the modification of humans or animals.
The Dutch agriculture industry, however, is sensitive to the demands for non-GM food products.
To date, retailers have protected themselves from public backlash against GM products by ensuring GM-free alternatives are available and by supporting compliance with labelling regulations.
Opportunities As a result of strong government support for biotechnology, the industry is in a growth and development phase, providing significant opportunities for strategic alliances between Canadian and Dutch firms.
Canada is, traditionally, a major supplier of food products to the Netherlands.
The Dutch marketplace is changing: affluence and changing lifestyles have created a larger demand for variety, including for convenience foods and high-value specialty foods.
Increasingly, Canada is becoming an important source for the Dutch consumer of both technology and value-added food products.
Significant potential exists for collaborative research opportunities in the area of functional foods - foods designed with specific health benefits.
The finished biotech product market for agriculture is also expected to expand in a number of areas in the coming years, including industry supplies (e.g. processing aids), microbial crop protectants and herbicides, and genetically engineered pest-resistant agricultural products.
Due to strict environmental legislation and increased public pressure, the environmental biotech industry in the Netherlands has strong potential for growth.
Applications include conversion of waste into useful products, more compact reactors and treatment centres for waste water, as well as process control and monitoring techniques.
There are also large areas of the country that require soil remediation to reclaim and return the land to useful production.
There are strong opportunities for Canadian exporters of bio-medical products.
Pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, vaccines and antigens offer the best sales prospects for at least the next three years.
The licensing and milestone market is also expected to have openings for drug-discovery, gene-sequencing and gene-mapping services.
Canadian firms with expertise in these areas could find opportunities for collaboration with Dutch firms.
As the biotech industry in the Netherlands matures and expands, there will be a growing need for companies offering equipment, support services and technical experience to supply the market.
There are good export prospects for cell- and tissue-cultivating equipment, fermentation equipment, bioreactor systems, high-performance liquid chromatography equipment, columns and accessories, electrophoresis instruments, pilot plant systems and process analysis systems.
COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT Local Capabilities The Dutch biotech industry is supported by a strong legislative framework and government programs.
These programs, which first supported R&D, are now geared toward product marketing, new company start-up and the commercialization of research results.
The Netherlands has a strong public research infrastructure.
It is home to 22 universities with biotech expertise.
Moreover, one quarter of research schools in the country are engaged in biotech research.
Dutch biotech firms enjoy a worldwide reputation for excellence, as evidenced by the high level of Dutch participation in EU research projects as well as the quantity and quality of publications issued annually.
The Netherlands also files more patent applications per capita than the global biotech leaders and is among the 10 most productive countries for obtaining copyrights and patents.
Over 90% of domestic biotech firms have offices or subsidiaries abroad.
International Competition Strong competition is felt from larger industries in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the United States, Canada and, increasingly, Japan.
Several leading biotech multinationals have established branches in the Netherlands including Novartis (Switzerland) and Unilever (U.K.). U.S.-based companies active in the market include Amgen, Biogen, Centecor, EuroCefcus and Gene Pharming.
Canadian Position Canada's positive relations with the world's most prominent economies, as well as its global reputation for scientific excellence, give Canadian companies an advantage in expanding their businesses to European markets.
Canadian companies are wellpositioned to provide joint-venture partnerships, public education initiatives and commercialization expertise to the Dutch biotech industry, as well as a broad range of products resulting from Canadian R&D efforts.
Canada's strengths in applying biotechnology to agricultural commercialization may be of interest to Dutch producers and researchers.
The Canadian agricultural biotech industry has already received government approval for a number of genetically altered products.
Canadian experience in this area will be valuable to the Dutch biotech industry as Dutch approval and monitoring processes are put into place.
Several Canadian companies are active in the Dutch market.
Montreal-based ProMetic Life Sciences Inc., for example, concluded a licensing agreement in early 2002 with PharmAAware SEPSIS B.V. to develop both diagnostic kit and a therapeutic protein for the treatment of sepsis and septic shock.
PharmAAware has obtained rights to ProMetic technology for purification of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase, and plans to exploit its endotoxin-neutralizing properties.
Competitive Advantage through Canadian Government Policies and Initiatives Canadian Commercial Corporation The Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC) gives Canadian companies access to financing and better payment terms under the Progress Payment Program (PPP).
The program emphasizes information in areas such as customs procedures, market access, shipping, labelling, distribution channels and currency regulations.
Flexibility and fast turnaround times are the hallmarks of this program.
Each mission includes thorough briefings on how to find an agent, a distributor, an associate, in other words how to do business in the destination country.
NEXOS missions are arranged for groups of companies in the same general sector.
Because of this, applications from individual firms cannot always be entertained.
The mission is usually built around an event such as a national or international trade fair.
Participants are responsible for their own transportation, accommodation and living expenses.
Contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT), European Business Development Section (REB) for more information about NEXOS.
Virtual Trade Commissioner The Virtual Trade Commissioner (vTC) is a new on-line service offered by Canada's Trade Commissioner Service of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.
The vTC offers registered users direct on-line access to market information, including market reports, business news, events and business leads related to the companies' industry sectors and markets of interest.
Users can request services on line from a trade commissioner responsible for their industry sector in their target markets.
PRIVATE-SECTOR CUSTOMERS The Netherlands is home to internationally renown research institutions and scientists in the area of biotechnology.
There is strong interest in technology transfer and collaborative research ventures in the Netherlands.
As is typical in the biotech industry, companies often require partnerships in order to help finance product development.
Collaborative research work is also beneficial to help penetrate a new market.
In 2001, there were approximately 2200 pharmacies in the Netherlands.
Over 1600 of these were operated by pharmacists; the remainder were operated by physicians.
OTC products represent 12% of the total pharmaceuticals market.
Both pharmacies and druggists sell OTC medications and are therefore important customers for pharmaceutical manufacturers.
Approximately 5.8% of OTC products are sold through supermarkets.
PUBLIC-SECTOR CUSTOMERS Government Organizations The Government of the Netherlands is a strong supporter of biotechnology.
The ministries of Economic Affairs, of Education, Culture and Sciences, and of Agriculture, Nature Management and Fisheries are particularly concerned with bioindustries, biomedical research and agricultural biotechnology.
These ministries support various research institutions across the country.
Regional governments also look to this sector as one for potential long-term growth and high-tech employment.
Federal and regional governments support biotechnology through direct funding, investment incentives and the creation of research centres of excellence.
Canadian companies interested in targeting government-funded research institutions for technology transfer agreements, licensing or partnering opportunities should continue their market research by perusing the company information offered through the contacts and Web sites listed at the end of this report.
Furthermore, the vTC and the Canadian Embassy in the Hague can provide guidance on how to enter this market.
Government Procurement Regulations Procurement regulations in the Netherlands comply with the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Government Procurement and EU procurement directives.
Tenders are issued in Dutch and English, although all technical documents will be in Dutch only.
Canadian firms should inquire before submitting an English-language bid.
All public tenders over €5 million (approximately $8 million) are published in the Tenders Electronic Daily (TED) database, a supplement of the Official Journal of the European Communities and the Dutch government gazette (Staatscourant).
There is a growing tendency in the Dutch market to purchase from a company located in the Netherlands or, alternatively, in Europe.
Therefore, local representation is recommended before, during and after the procurement process.
This is particularly important if the successful company is providing services or equipment.
MARKET LOGISTICS Channels of Distribution With Rotterdam as the largest seaport in the world, Amsterdam as the fourth-largest cargo airport in Europe, and an intricate network of river barge and highway transportation systems, the Netherlands is strategically located as a distribution centre for other EU countries.
Legislation exists to protect agents from dismissal and breach of contract.
Most Dutch have a working knowledge of English, but Canadian companies should make the effort to translate promotional materials into Dutch.
Distributors and Wholesalers Canadian manufacturers who are new to the market are advised to appoint a distributor or wholesaler to represent their interests in the Netherlands.
The leading wholesale pharmaceutical distributor in the Netherlands is Apothekers Cooperatie OPG U.A. (OPG).
Other major distributors include Euromedica, Brocacef Holding and Interpharm Group BV.
Joint Ventures and Partnerships Joint ventures between Canadian and Dutch companies are quite feasible since Dutch researchers are increasingly interested in forming strategic alliances with foreign firms.
Canadian companies involved in joint ventures with Dutch companies can take advantage of their partner's knowledge of the local market, cultural and technological differences, existing customer-base and dealer network, marketing and sales experience and support services.
A local partner can further establish valuable connections with government and local officials.
The most important step is to find a good local partner who is well-connected in the industry.
Assistance in identifying appropriate Dutch business partners may be obtained by contacting the Canadian Embassy in the Netherlands.
It is advisable that Canadian companies check the background of a potential partner company.
All Dutch companies must be listed with their local chamber of commerce and the Netherlands Foreign Trade Agency.
Market-entry Considerations Suggested Business Practices Dutch companies often operate in a complex business culture in which consensus is sought among government bodies and industry associations - all of which are often in close consultation.
Egalitarianism is a central tenant of Dutch society and everyone affected by a decision will be consulted, no matter their position in the company.
Generally, the Dutch are known to speak their minds and will not waste time if they are not interested in a product or service.
Punctuality is very important for all business and social meetings, and all appointments should be made well in advance.
Import Regulations As an EU member, the Netherlands follows the Community Integrated Tariff (TARIC) system, which applies duties to all imports from non-EU countries.
Dutch import duties for pharmaceuticals range from 3% to 6% and are based on the cost, insurance and freight (c.i.f.) value of the shipment.
For this reason, Canadian companies must negotiate with a company within the European Union to license pharmaceuticals for sale, to purchase a Dutch company or to establish a corporate subsidiary in the European Union.
Intellectual Property Protection Patents The Netherlands is a signatory to the Paris Convention, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the Patent Co-ordination Treaty and the European Patent Convention.
This means that any person applying for a patent in one of the signatory countries enjoys a one-year priority right to register the same patent in the Netherlands.
Companies should contact the European Patent Office for inquires about registering patents.
The Netherlands Industrial Property Office is responsible for granting national patents.
Additional patent protection is available through EU Directive 98/44/EC for pharmaceutical products containing biological material or for processes involving biological material.
Trademarks The Uniform Benelux Law on Trademarks governs the registration of trademarks in the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.
According to the law, a trademark must be registered for the entire territory - not only one or two countries.
The first user of a mark is entitled to its registration.
Applications should be filed with the Benelux Trademark Office.
Trademarks are registered in the Benelux countries for 10 years from the date of application and are renewable for 10-year periods.
Before beginning the trademark process, Canadian exporters should consult professional agents.
The European Community Trademark Act established the Community Trade Mark with a registration system that came into force on April 1, 1996.
The system co-exists with national registration systems.
Applications are filed with the Interior Market Harmonizing Office in Spain.
Copyrights The Netherlands currently recognizes a copyright for the life of the author/inventor plus 70 years.
In May 1998, the European Union passed legislation that allows for copyright protection of biotech inventions, including artificial genes.
Local Standards, Certificates or Registrations Canadian firms exporting to Europe are still confronted with both national and EU product standards.
These regulations occasionally change to meet new technology and more stringent demands.
Agricultural and Food Biotechnology European Union In an effort to rebuild public confidence in EU food safety regimes, the European Commission has proposed regulations on labelling and traceability.
These regulations will require genetically modified organisms (GMOs) to be documented on a transformation event basis.
Under the new proposal, all food and animal products imported by EU countries must bear a label alerting consumers of the presence of GM ingredients.
The new regulations also include measures that impose the separation of GM and conventional crops.
For further details, consult "Canadian Exporters' Guide to Food Labelling & Packaging Requirements of the European Union" at http://ats.agr.ca/info/europe/e1429.htm. The Netherlands The Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (VROM) is responsible for implementing EU directives on both the release of GMOs into the environment and the contained use of GMOs.
Decisions are made with the consultation and agreement of the Minister of Agriculture, Nature Management and Fisheries.
Anyone wishing to conduct research or work with GMOs must receive a permit under the Environmental Protection Act and notify the VROM of their work.
The Committee on Genetic Modification (COGEM) is an independent technical and scientific advisory committee in the Netherlands, appointed by VROM.
Beyond advising on safety issues concerning biotechnology, COGEM is tasked with alerting relevant authorities to any possible ethical and social concern.
The committee is composed of scientists who are subdivided into eight subcommittees concerned with plants, animals, microorganisms, viruses, large-scale activities, medical issues, education and information, and ethical and social issues.
Medical Biotechnology European Union Canadian prescription drugs must be approved by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medical Products (EMEA) before they can be sold in the Netherlands.
As of January 1995, registration in any EU state is recognized by all other EU members.
EMEA approval must be obtained for all biotech and other high-tech pharmaceutical products, but is optional for other products.
The EMEA application and approval process takes 300-400 days, and the cost is approximately $250 000 (20-40% less than the cost of obtaining a single, national approval).
The EMEA is responsible for ensuring quality and safety of all medical products and monitoring compliance with specific guidelines.
The Netherlands The Medicines Evaluation Board (MEB) is an independent administrative body comprising doctors and pharmacists who are appointed by the Crown and responsible for authorizing medical products for human use in the Netherlands.
The MEB is also involved in granting European marketing authorization and works collaboratively with the EMEA.
In order to obtain marketing authorization for new products, Canadian prescription drugs must be registered by a Dutch company (either a manufacturer or distributor) that is officially designated as being able to submit registration applications.
This company must submit information related to the quality, safety and efficacy of the product, as well as a proposal for public product information leaflets.
Once the file is reviewed by a panel of experts, the MEB decides whether to grant marketing authorization and, if such authorization is granted, finalizes product information texts.
All product labelling must include the marketing authorization number, beginning with "RVG."
Other EU members are expected to recognize this marketing authorization, unless there are serious objections related to public health.
In such cases, manufacturers can apply for arbitration by the EU Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products.
The MEB is responsible for limiting conditions under which a product is authorized, as well as for suspending or revoking market authorization if new information is presented concerning adverse reactions.
Determination of the legal status (prescription or OTC) of a new drug is also set by the MEB.
For details on product labelling, registration applications and fees, contact the MEB.
Export Credit Risks, Restrictions on Letter of Credit, Currency Controls The most common method of payment from the Netherlands is by open account.
Payments for large shipments are frequently done by irrevocable letter of credit.

Turkey Past Present & Future Report January 2007 Overview Turkey is a democratic, secular, presidential country, with its population of about 73.3 million mostly represented by Muslims.
Its ideal location as a Eurasian country linking Europe to the Middle East and the Caucasus to the Central Asian Republics, allows for tremendous opportunity in the future as Turkey’s economy continues to modernize.
Turkey is working to overcome its 2001 economic crisis with help from the International Monetary Fund.
Negotiations for Turkey’s accession to the European Union (EU) also commenced in 2005.
This potential membership, although controversial, is increasing foreign investment interest and will help open doors to more trade.
While traditionally, the Turkish consumer market has not supported large quantities of imported products, due to its rural, poor population consuming locally-produced staple foods, this market is becoming more like its EU neighbours.
Exporters may find increased access through an increasing per capita income, the significant young and urban populations, and the country’s booming tourism industry.
Turkey has become a major world tourist destination, seeing more than 20 million visitors each year.
Canada - Turkey Relations Canada’s strong bilateral ties with Turkey stem from a close and long-standing partnership in political, commercial and security issues and activity.
In May 2003, bilateral relations were further developed during a visit to Turkey’s capital, Ankara.
Here, the countries signed a Framework Memorandum of Understanding on Bilateral Relations which will enhance means and mechanisms to promote and deepen the full range of mutual interest to both countries.
Canada and Turkey are also linked through involvement in multilateral organizations such as NATO, the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the Council of Europe.
Both Canada and Turkey’s major contributions to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan in recent years has also helped to reinforce the countries’ long-standing military forces co-operation.
Economic/commercial relations also play a vital role in the strong Canada-Turkey relationship.
Although trade numbers have not been competitive with other world markets in the past, bilateral trade between the countries has nearly tripled in the last decade, surpassing $1.1 billion in 2005.
In the same year, Canadian investment was also strong, totalling $762 million.
Canada Turkey Country Report:
January 2007
•
Canadian agricultural exports were faced with Turkey’s 2001 economic crisis which largely decreased export numbers, but Canada’s recovery has been strong in recent years.
However, this growth was impeded in 2005, as major decreases in such products as wheat and oilseeds caused agricultural exports to drop by roughly 25% from 2004’s $51.9 million to 2005’s $39.1 million.
Red and green lentils combined totalled $26.1 million, an increase of 296% from the previous year’s total of $6.6 million.
• From January to October 2006 green lentils experienced significant growth, with export numbers having reached 20.5% growth over the 2005 full-year total.
However, during the same period in 2006, red lentil exports did not experience the same success, with January to October numbers at roughly $5.9 million, less than half of the 2005 red lentil export total of $14 million.
Soya bean exports to Turkey were unusually high in 2005 at $2.1 million.
This was more than a 7,700% jump from 2004’s total of $26,900.
Export values will likely recover somewhat in 2006, with January-October numbers already valued at over $668,000.
This tremendous growth is mainly attributed to significant increases in green lentil exports to Turkey in 2005.
• In the same year, grain, bulk and cereal exports experienced the opposite effect.
While in 2003-04, this commodity group represented 91% and 86% of Canada’s agri-food export value, 2005 saw this value drop to only 2% market share.
• In 2005, consumer products represented 16% of Canada’s total agri-food exports to Turkey.
Top consumer goods included hatching eggs (63%), dog and cat food (11.2%), food preparations (10.1%), chicken (5%) and potatoes (3.6%).
Canada’s Top 5 Agricultural Exports to Turkey (2005) Lentils, dried and shelled Eggs, hatching Soya beans, nes Bovine semen Cat and dog food $26.1 million $4 million $2.2 million $884,000 $798,800
Complete Statistical Summary Available: http://www.ats.agr.gc.ca/stats/turkey_e.pdf Economy Modern Turkey’s democratic, presidential republic was founded out of a revolutionary struggle in 1923.
This government is currently headed by President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, who was elected in 2000.
With a population estimated at 73.3 million people, Turkey’s economy is a mix of modern industry with emerging automotive and electronic sectors, yet still maintains an important agricultural sector that makes up almost 12% of GDP and one-third of the workforce.
Turkey’s economy, however, is most reliant on its dominant textiles and clothing industries.
Foreign investment has been strong and is forecast to increase with Turkey’s prospective accession to the European Union (EU).
The softer lira and weaker domestic demand, however, is expected to lower the current-account deficit slightly in 2007-08.
Single working women, in particular, are driving Turkey’s acceptance of Westernized, processed foods.
Currently, processed food consumption only makes up about 15-20% of food products in Turkey, although this will likely rise in the future.
Food prices in Turkey, especially for imported processed goods, are very high.
Although per capita income is rapidly rising, purchasing power in Turkey is still relatively low.
Canadian exporters must also recognize that Turkey’s rural and poor communities are likely to purchase local, bulk products, and traditional values, often based on Islamic principles, affect consumer buying habits.
For instance, of Turkey’s estimated 15 million households, about 33% of them house five or more people.
Single-person households are typically high consumers of Westernized, processed foods, but in Turkey this group only makes up roughly 2% of the population.
Unlike many other European countries, young households are not common in Turkey as young adults traditionally live with their parents until marriage.
In Turkish culture, it is believed that un-married couples should not live together.
• In 2006, the median age in Turkey was 28.1 years.
• Higher education attainment has increased significantly over the last decade.
• Turkey’s urban population, which was estimated to be 34.4 million in 1990, is over 57 million in current terms and accounts for roughly 80% of the population.
• In recent years, Turkey’s retail sector has benefited from more consumer purchasing power.
From 2004-2005, per capita income increased by roughly 18% and from 2003- 2004, Turkish consumers’ incomes rose by 23%.
• The majority of consumer expenditure is allocated to food and beverages, making up 28% (2005 est.) of spending.
• Turkey’s retail food market is estimated to be valued at US$40 billion a year, and it continues to modernize and grow.
• According to industry sources, the number of hypermarkets rose to over 150 in 2005, compared to more than 125 in 2000.
Small, local grocery stores, called "bakkals", decreased in the same years, with 2005 numbers estimated at 120,000 compared to 2000’s 135,000 stores.
• Increasingly, consumers prefer making larger shopping trips to major supermarket chains as compared to buying immediate needs at local, smaller shops.
Discount shopping is also a major trend in Turkey.
• Turkish consumers are large consumers of private label goods at supermarkets as these products are comparatively less expensive (35-40% cheaper than branded products).
For some food products, private label purchases can account for up to 40% of total sales.
• Migros and Carrefour are Turkey’s largest retail grocery chains.
Tourism and Restaurant Industries
• Turkey has become a major world tourist destination, seeing more than 20 million tourists each year and an increasing presence of luxury hotel development year to year.
• The hotel sector is estimated to comprise about 25% of Turkey’s total food service sales.
From 2001-05, the hotel sector grew about 20% per year parallel to the growth in the tourism industry.
Tourism sector income was expected to reach US$21 billion in 2006.
• In 2005, the Turkish foodservice industry recorded positive growth for the first time over the 2000-05 review period.
Currently, there are roughly 50,000 restaurants in Turkey.
• The food service industry, typically fast-food outlets and cafeterias, benefit from the growing number of people working in a more fast-paced and modernized work environment.
Café chains, such as Starbucks, are also a high growth area in Turkey.
Food Processing Sector
• In 2002, it was estimated that there were roughly 32,700 food processing firms in Turkey.
• Recent investment in the food processing industry is allowing for productionfocus in the following food sectors: dairy products (i.e. milk, yogurt, cheese, ice cream) as well as chocolate, biscuits and fruit juices.
• As Turkey becomes more modernized, manufacturers have been making improvements to the sector in recent years, with investments in ready-to-eat meals and frozen food products, and more emphasis on bringing quality standards up to par with those of its EU neighbours.
High-Value Retail Products
• Alcoholic beverages: o In 2005, alcoholic drinks reached US$7 billion, an increase of 14% from 2000-05. o This growth is due to the liberalization of alcoholic drinks at the end of 2003, following the privatization of Tekel, the Turkish government monopoly that formerly handled alcoholic beverages.
Now, many new companies have started to operate either as manufacturers or importers. o Beer and wine are the strongest beverages in the Turkish alcoholic beverage market.
• Internationally-recognized branded products: o Brand products account for about 30% of all imported food products in Turkey. o Popular imported brand products include cocoa and instant coffee; chocolate and confectionary goods; cookies and crackers; breakfast cereals; cheese, alcoholic beverages; sauces; seafood and pet food.
• Non-alcoholic beverages: o Bottled water consumption increased by almost 53% from 1999-2003. o Sports drinks are also rising in demand in the Turkish market.
• High Cost Products o High cost products such as gourmet seafood and blueberries are not widely available in Turkey and may have be valuable export items, especially to Turkey’s hotel industry.
Competitors International agri-food exporters wishing to gain access into the Turkish market are faced with harsh competition from the country’s domestic products.
Turkish products have a distinct cost advantage over foreign products due to high import duties, consumption taxes and distribution costs.
Domestic goods account for 97% of food and beverage inputs, and in hotels and restaurants that feature foreign cuisine, domestic products still account for 90% of industry consumption.
With greater emphasis on Westernized cuisine choices in recent terms, and its shift towards EU food norms, international products should represent a greater market share in the near future.
The majority of Turkey’s imports come from its European neighbors due to its membership in the EU Customs Union, geographic proximity, large European tourist numbers and favorable cuisine tastes from countries such as France and Italy.
European imports are also favored as trade agreements with the EU allow for quotafree access and lower duties for agricultural products.
While Canada is not currently a significant supplier of agri-food products to the Turkish market, this situation may improve as Canada and Turkey are currently discussing a Double Taxation Agreement.
• The U.S. is Turkey’s largest exporter of agricultural products, with a market share of about 17% in 2005.
According to 2005 U.S. Census data, the country’s food and agricultural products to Turkey reached a record US$1.08 billion that year.
U.S. success in Turkey’s import market can be largely attributed to its establishment of North-American fast-food chains like McDonald’s, Burger King, etc.
Other leading competitors are Brazil for its fruit juices, Egypt, an exporter of rice, and Ecuador as it exports bananas to Turkey.
Access Issues The Turkish government is highly protective of domestic products.
However, with greater interest in international imported foods and beverages by consumers, and changes being implemented to match EU import standards, Canadians may find greater accessibility to the country’s market.
• Turkey protects its consumers and domestic producers by enforcing oftenchanging technical requirements for processed foods.
Turkey has seasonal import bans on bulk agricultural goods which are enforced through the system of import licensing (and high tariffs) to protect domestic producers.
Turkey has high import duties on various bulk and processed products such as wheat (130%), corn (130%), rice (45%), wine (70%), popcorn (30%) and tomato paste (135%).
Although wine and beer import taxes are high, a recent change in product distribution regulations now allows for these beverages to be imported into the Turkish retail market.
Import duties on soybeans and soybean meal increased in 2006.
Soybeans former import duty being 0% is now 10% and soybean meal former duty at 8% has now increased to 15%.
Distributors and Import Partners
• Appointing an agent or distributor, or establishing joint ventures with local firms is important in gaining access to the Turkish market.
• In Turkey, imported food products are generally handled by specialist import distribution companies.
• Canadian exporters are advised to investigate local partnerships, joint ventures and licensing agreements.
While these segments do not currently import a significant quantity of agri-food products, developing these relationships may benefit exporters when Turkey’s agri-food market opens and demand for Western-style cuisines and ingredients increases.
• Turkish import firms prefer to deal with exporters who are responsive to letters, faxes, and calls.
Business Travel Tips
• Like European business practices, Turkish business people place high value on personal relationships.
For example, its customary to have casual conversations over tea or coffee during business meetings.
• Although many in the Turkish business community are comfortable using English or French in meetings, taking the time to learn some Turkish phrases is appreciated.
• Business cards should be translated into Turkish and be distributed to all in business meetings.
It is also the norm to provide business cards to receptionists.
• Turkey’s proximity to unstable Middle Eastern countries and its increasingly large number of foreign tourists make Turkey a target for politically-charged violent acts.
• While the majority of Turkey’s population is Muslim, it is a secular country and therefore, is not governed by Islamic law (Sharia).
• For general travel precautions and assistance, please review the Canadian Government’s Travel Report on Turkey: http://www.voyage.gc.ca/dest/ Agriculture Sector & Policies Turkey’s abundant agricultural sector accounts for 11.7% of its GDP and still employs roughly one-third of its population.
With the modernization of its economy, the Turkish government recognizes that changes must be made to the agricultural sector for future prosperity.
Since then, the government is attempting to move away from subsidizing farms and is now focused on providing direct income support for farmers.
It is also a large producer of seafood and meat.
Over the last decade, the government has supported greenhouses to be built in Eastern Turkey to increase vegetable production during the harsh winter months.
Red meat production has also increased in recent years due to investment from national and multinational companies.
Turkey’s poultry industry is still suffering due to the Avian Influenza outbreak of 2005.
A total of about 2.3 million birds have been culled since the outbreak.

MARKET OVERVIEW Spain offers an attractive consumer market for foreign products and services in virtually every sector.
The country has a growing gross domestic product, valued at just over $1.1 trillion(2) in 2002, and a population exceeding 40 million people.
The alcoholic beverages market is the second-largest segment in Spain's food industry, accounting for nearly 14% of the total food industry.
Spain is a strong producer of wine and beer and an avid importer of spirits.
In 2002, the alcoholic beverages market experienced steady growth, with sales rising 4% over 2001.
Sales of alcoholic beverages are influenced largely by the tourism industry.
As a world leader in tourism, Spain can be a lucrative market for exporters of wine (especially ice wine), beer and spirits.
In 2002, the number of visitors to Spain fell by 3% to approximately 75 million tourists.
Consumption of alcoholic beverages in Spain has also been influenced by recent economic and legislative developments.
In 2002, prices of alcohol increased as a result of a rise in taxes on alcohol and the adoption of the Euro.
In an effort to prevent reckless drinking, the Spanish government has also imposed a regulation prohibiting manufacturers of beverages with high alcohol content (i.e. more than 20%) from advertising or participating in any sponsorship agreement.
Furthermore, the legal age for purchasing alcohol changed to 18 years old and the sale of alcohol after 11 p.m. is prohibited.
Moreover, the buying patterns of many Spaniards demonstrate an increased health awareness among consumers.
Consumers are leaning toward purchasing alcoholic beverages that have been found to provide some health benefit, such as red wine, or those with a low alcohol content.
As a result, many producers of alcoholic beverages are developing new products to fit this trend.
In 2002, Spain imported approximately $1.7-billion worth of alcoholic beverages, representing 92% of total beverage imports to Spain.
While overall imports of alcoholic beverages declined by 7% over 2001, imports of wine climbed 11% to exceed $100 million.
Wine imports were evenly distributed: still wines accounted for 48% of the imported wine market and sparkling wine, 45%.
Spirits--particularly whiskies--were the largest segment of alcoholic beverages imports, accounting for 72% of the total.
In 2002, spirits imports amounted to approximately $1.3 billion, falling 8% from 2001.
Beer imports, which accounted for 12% of alcoholic beverages imports, decreased by 11% to $203.4 million in 2002.
Alcoholic beverages imported into Spain are subject to import tariffs and labelling requirements set out by the European Union and a 16% value-added tax (VAT).
For detailed information on import tariffs and labelling, contact the Canadian Embassy in Spain.
Wine Although Spanish grape growers are challenged by dry weather, poor soil conditions and mediocre irrigation systems, Spain is the world's fourth-largest producer of wine.
In 2002, Spanish vineyards yielded approximately 32 million hectolitres of wine, a 3% increase over the previous year.
Wine production is anticipated to continue to increase, with volumes growing by nearly 13% by 2006.
Close to half of Spanish wine is produced in Castilla-La Mancha.
The best wines originate from Galicia, Catalonia and Castilla-Leon.
Spain is the fifth-largest consumer of wine in the world, behind France, Italy, the United States and Germany.
Table wines account for 65% of wine consumption in Spain, however, high-quality wines are becoming increasingly popular.
In 2002, total wine consumption dropped by just over 4% to 15.4 million hectolitres, ranking Spain's per-capita consumption the seventh highest in the world.
While per-capita consumption of table wine fell over 10% to 20.5 litres, demand for quality wines increased, with per-capita consumption rising by 7% to 7.9 litres.
Over half of quality/specialty wine sales is of red wines, followed by white wines (21%), sparkling wines (13%) and rosés (7%).
Demand for quality and special occasion wines is expected to continue to rise.
In addition to the 16% VAT, Canadian exporters should also be aware of the import tariffs applied to wines, based on their type.
For instance, bottled wine is subject to an import tariff of $19.45 (13.10) per 100 litres, while the tariff on sparkling wine is $47.51 (32.00) per 100 litres.
Beer The tourism sector can, potentially, affect levels of beer consumption by up to 20%.
As a result of the 3% decline in tourism in 2002, demand for beer decreased marginally (by just over 1%) to approximately 30.1 million hectolitres.
However, the introduction of the Euro, and high demand for expensive varieties of imported and specialty beers, increased the value of the beer market in Spain.
In 2002, Spain's beer market was valued at $3.3 billion, rising 6% over the previous year.
Specialty beer represented the largest segment of the market, accounting for over half of beer sales, followed by lagers (38%) and ales and stout beers (7%).
The beer market in Spain is forecast to continue to grow 1% through to 2006.
The non-alcoholic beers market is a growing segment in the Spanish market, spurred on by anti-drinking campaigns and Spaniards' increased awareness about their health.
Spain is one of the largest consumers of low-alcohol or non-alcoholic beer in Europe.
In 2002, consumption of low-alcohol or non-alcoholic beers increased 4%, reaching 2 million hectolitres.
Spirits In accordance with other segments of the Spanish alcoholic beverages sector, spirits revenues have grown due to increased prices, while volume sales are down.
The market for spirits in Spain was valued at nearly $10 billion in 2002, rising 5% since 2000.
During that same period, sales volumes decreased by 0.8% to 329.9 million litres.
The decline in consumption is fuelled by the negative image attributed to high alcohol-content drinks.
However, according to Datamonitor, the Spanish market for spirits is forecast to continue its steady growth, increasing by 4% by 2004.
Spain is the largest whisky market in the world.
Whisky accounts for over half of total spirit sales in Spain.
White spirits are the next-largest segment, representing just over 14% of the total market, followed by brandy and cognac (10.3%) and rum (9.9%).
While sales for white spirits and rum increased in 2002, demand for brandy and cognac declined significantly, dropping 27% since 2001.
Overall, imports of spirits to Spain declined by 8% in 2002.
However, imports of rum climbed 32% to $210.7 million.
The only other category in this segment that experienced an increase was imported vodka, which rose 5% over 2001 figures.
OPPORTUNITIES Canadian companies interested in exporting their products to Spain will find opportunities particularly prosperous during the summer months.
From April to July, tourism is at its peak and demand from the hospitality industry for quality alcoholic beverages is high.
Since Spain is a strong supplier of wine and beer products, and an avid importer of spirits, Canadian exporters will find most opportunities in niche markets of the alcoholic beverages sector.
Products that present good market potential in Spain include quality and specialty wines, low-alcohol and non-alcoholic beers, whisky, and flavoured rum drinks (such as Malibu Rum and Bacardi Breezers).
As a result of poor weather conditions, Spanish vintners produced lower-quality wines in 2002.
Canadian companies, therefore, may find good opportunities to market and sell specialty wines such as ice wine in Spain.
Furthermore, Canadian exporters interested in entering the Spanish wine market are recommended to target the regions around Madrid and Barcelona, where consumers are more accepting of different and imported wines.
Consumers' increased attention to their health has opened up opportunities for beverages that contain lower alcohol content or provide some health benefit.
In 2002, nearly one fifth of low-alcohol consumption was of low-alcohol/non-alcoholic beer varieties.
Furthermore, the establishment of new legislation is discouraging consumers from purchasing drinks with high alcohol content.
Canadian breweries should target the regions in Southern Spain, where per-capita consumption of beer is at its greatest.
Canadian suppliers should appoint a local agent or distributor who is familiar with import regulations and licensing requirements.
Some international companies may also find it easier to conduct business in Spain by setting up a local office or operations in one of the country's major business centres, Madrid or Barcelona.
The Madrid hub principally serves the central, southern and western parts of Spain, while Barcelona serves the north and east.
Regional characteristics influence buying patterns.
A competent agent or distributor takes this into account when marketing products.

KEY PARTICIPANTS The Spanish alcoholic beverage industry is dominated by large multinational companies such as Spanish-owned Bodegas y Bebidas, Garcia Carrion and Miguel Torres, which are leaders in the Spanish wine market.
Prominent participants in Spain's beer market include Heineken (Amsterdam), Scottish & Newcastle (United Kingdom) and Damm Group (Barcelona).
There are approximately 21 breweries in Spain.
The spirits market in Spain is relatively concentrated; the top three producers--Allied Domecq (United Kingdom), Diageo plc.
(United Kingdom) and Pernod Ricard (France)--account for 51% of the market.
Other key participants in the spirits market include supermarket private labels (9.2%), Bermuda's Bacardi (7.3%) and Spain's Osborne y Cia SA (5.7%), while small local spirits producers comprise the rest of the market.
The majority of alcoholic beverages imports to Spain originate from other European Union (EU) countries, particularly the United Kingdom (with 44% import share), France (11%), and Germany and Italy (6% each).
EU members share a common agricultural policy, a joint transportation policy, free movement of goods and capital within member states and a common tariff on imported products coming from non-EU countries.
Canadian Position In 2002, Spanish imports of Canadian alcoholic beverages dropped 29% to $1.3 billion.
Whisky is Canada's leading alcoholic export to Spain, accounting for 89% of alcoholic beverages exports.
Imports of Canadian wines showed strong performance in 2002, increasing by 178%, due to a significant price increase on Canadian wines.
PRIVATE-SECTOR CUSTOMERS Canadian companies interested in penetrating the Spanish alcoholic beverages market should target the hotel, restaurant and catering (HORECA) sector.
Given the large tourism industry in Spain, the HORECA sector accounts for 70% of quality wine sales, 50% of sparkling wine sales, 45% of table wine sales and 70% of spirit revenues.
Other key customers of alcoholic beverages are supermarkets and retailers.
Approximately 80% of alcoholic beverages sales to the HORECA sector are supplied by a distributor or wholesaler.
Therefore, Canadian companies should appoint a local distributor to access the Spanish market.
Spanish importers tend to be conservative in their buying habits and expect to develop long-term relationships with their suppliers.
Barriers to accessing the Spanish market are generally those that apply to the European Union as a whole.
Canadian exporters should consult the Canadian Food Inspection Agency regarding any certification requirement.
Canadian companies will also find information regarding labelling requirements on the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Web site at http://ats.agr.ca/info/europe-e.htm.

Market Information Europe Market Brief The Pulse Products Market in Spain January 2003 © Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade FaxLink # 0800004 Report prepared by the Market Research Centre Market Support Division (TCM) Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 125 Sussex Drive, Ottawa K1A 0G2 Fax: (613) 943-1103 E-mail: mrc@dfait-maeci.gc.ca The Market Research Centre produces a wide range of market reports by region and sector for Canadian exporters.
Quick Facts Market Highlights
• Spain offers an attractive consumer market for foreign products and services in virtually every sector.
The country has a gross domestic product (GDP) of $1.1 trillion1 and a population in excess of 40 million.
• Spain is a large and consistent market for Canadian pulse products.
Three of Canada's top exports to Spain in 2001 were pulses: dried peas, lentils and dried beans.
• Local production can not meet Spanish demand for beans, peas, chick peas and lentils.
Spain will therefore continue to be a strong market for these Canadian pulses in the years ahead.
• Supply opportunities are available for processed pulse products, particularly canned products, as well as raw/dried pulse products to be used by the domestic food-processing industry and local foodservice sector.
• The growing private-label market is also a promising area for Canadian pulse products.
• Canada is Spain's top supplier of dried leguminous vegetables.
In 2001, total pulse imports from Canada totalled over $75 million.
Other leading foreign competitors include Mexico, Argentina, the United States and the United Kingdom.
• The United States supplies 95% of pardina lentils consumed in Spain.
This variety of lentil has been tested in Canada but is not conducive to growing in the Canadian climate.
Because of their high yields and subsequent low prices, pardinas could become a threat to the Canadian lentil market share.
• Spanish consumers are concerned about food safety and therefore place a premium on quality.
• Exporters to Spain generally appoint a local agent or distributor who can warehouse and transport goods.
While marketing products directly to retail outlets is not a common practice, some supermarket chains will directly import certain products, such as pulses, to be repackaged in their warehouses.
Export Checklist
• The value-added tax levied on agri-food products in Spain is 7%.
• All exports must be accompanied by a standard set of shipping documents.
Mandatory label information must be printed in Spanish.
• The Canadian Special Crops Association (CSCA)2 can serve as a helpful contact for Canadian exporters dealing in the Spanish market.
Market Summary
The country has a $1.1 trillion GDP (as of January 2002) and a population in excess of 40 million that doubles every year with the influx of tourists.
In addition, because of Spain's membership in the European Union (EU), products cleared for sale in Spain can move freely into other EU member states, providing an excellent opportunity for foreign companies seeking to access other lucrative European markets nearby.
• The Spanish market is decentralized, with the major cities of Madrid and Barcelona serving as hubs for the country's regional markets.
Most multinational firms in Spain establish their operational bases in Madrid.
Barcelona connects Spain's northern and eastern regions, as well as the Balearic Islands and the enclave cities, Ceuta and Melilla, in North Africa.
Spain's primary ports are Barcelona and Bilbao.
• Spain has one of Europe's largest agricultural sectors and is a large recipient of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) funding.
Spain's major agri-food products include grains, vegetables, pulses, olives, wine grapes, sugar beets, citrus, beef, pork, poultry, dairy products and fish.
• Canada's agri-food exports to Spain in 2001 totalled $135.3 million.
Three of Canada's top exports were pulses: dried peas (40.9% of total exports to Spain), lentils (6.4%) and dried beans (3%).
Although pulse products are grown domestically, local production can not meet the large and growing demand.
Spain will therefore continue to be a strong market for Canadian pulses in the years ahead.
Beans
• In 2001, Spain's total bean production amounted to 20 000 metric tonnes.
The province of Ávila is known for the production of several types of beans for human consumption including white beans (Alubias blancas), white round (Blanca redonda), white kidney (Blanca riñon), dark red kidney (Morada larga), small white (Morada redonda, Arrocina and Planchada) and small white (Judión de Barco).
The total Ávila zone includes 116 351 hectares of land dedicated to bean crops.
The popular Faba Asturian beans are grown in the Principality of Asturias.
Other dry bean varieties grown in Spain include Alubia de riñon, Faba Granja Asturian, Pinta de Leon, and Tolosana.
All beans produced in the country are summer-grown species.
• Beans are used in a number of Spanish dishes including soups, stews and side dishes.
Annual per capita consumption is 4.6 kilograms.
• In 2001, Argentina was Spain's main supplier of beans.
Canada captured a significant portion of this market however; 2001 bean exports include kidney beans ($6.7 million), small red beans ($19 962) and other beans ($863 408).
With sales of $8.6 million, Canada followed the United Kingdom and France as the third-largest supplier in broad beans/horse beans category.
• Imports of dry beans by Spain are expected to decrease to 55 200 metric tonnes in 2002-2003; approximately 200 metric tonnes less than 2001-2002 import totals.
• The average price, over all classes and grades, is forecast to decrease by 15- 20% because of increased global supply.
Chick Peas
• Although over 81 000 hectares are devoted to chick pea production in Spain, consumption is so great that imports are required.
With import forecasts of 55 800 metric tonnes in 2002-2003, Spain is among the top ten global importers of chick peas.
• Chick peas, also known as garbanzo beans, are used almost exclusively for human consumption in soups, hotpots, and as condiments and side dishes.
The kabuli type, the most popular variety in Spain, is known as an excellent source of protein, fibre, complex carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals.
• With exports of $57.4 million in 2001, Mexico is the leading supplier of chick peas to the Spanish market.
Exports from Canada, Spain's second-largest supplier, totalled $3.2 million in 2001.
• Total world supply is expected to remain stable at about 8 million metric tonnes.
Canadian exports are forecast to increase as Canada's share of total world supply increases.
The average price over all types, sizes and grades is forecast to be the same as in 2001-02.
Peas
• Spain devotes 52 000 hectares to pea production.
In 2000, the country produced a total of 54 000 metric tonnes of green peas and 48 000 metric tonnes of dry peas.
• Spain is the largest importer of peas in Europe.
Despite the price issue, exports of feed peas from Canada are still in great demand as they are becoming increasingly more popular in domestic rations.
Peas are used in a number of products including pasta dishes, baked goods, vegetarian dishes, baby food, pet foods and snacks.
Total annual human consumption of peas in Spain is 5200 metric tonnes.
• Pea proteins are a growing market throughout Europe.
Demand for pulse proteins by food manufacturers is growing throughout Europe as a result of consumer backlash against genetically modified soya protein.
The total European market for pulse proteins in 2000 was $171 million or 52 000 metric tonnes.
Although demand for pulse proteins by the feed industry is expected to decline in the coming years, due to the availability of less expensive and more effective alternatives such as gluten, demand by food-processing sectors will make up the difference.
The annual growth rate between 2001 and 2007 is projected to be 10.8%.
Market leaders of pulse proteins include Canada's Parrhein Foods, which is Europe's largest provider, Avebe Glucona, Quest International, Cargill and Kerry Ingredients.
• Smaller European pea crops have resulted in a significant increase of Canadian feed peas being shipped to Europe in recent years.
With sales of $55 million, Canada was Spain's leading supplier of dried peas in 2001.
Other foreign competitors included the Ukraine, France, the United States and Russia.
• Prices for dried peas are expected to be pressured by lower protein meal and feed grain prices, lower food market demand and higher Canadian supply.
The average price, over all types, grades and markets, is forecast to decrease 10- 15%, as compared to 2001-02.
Total imports by Spain are expected to increase from 575 334 metric tonnes in 2001-2002 to 591 278 metric tonnes in 2002-2003.
Lentils
• Spaniards consume over 2 kilograms of lentils per person per year.
Lentils are used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, salads and casseroles, and are a dominant staple on Fridays as a meat substitute.
• Spain is best known for its production of the Armuña lentil, also called lentil of Salamanca-named after the area they are grown.
Known for their high quality and good taste, Armuña lentils are planted in October and harvested at the end of June or the first week of July.
Approximately 21 000 hectares is dedicated to domestic production of lentils.
• Despite local production of 9000 metric tonnes, Spain is among the top ten medium-sized lentil importers in the world.
"Bi-Weekly Bulletin:
Lentils," June 7, 2002.
Downloaded from http://www.agr.gc.ca/policy/winn/biweekly/English/ biweekly/volume15/v15n11ea.htm on June 13, 2002.
• Medium green lentils are the most popular type of lentil in Spain.
Spanish brown lentils also sell well in the market.
• As Spain's top overall supplier of pulse products, future opportunities for Canadian exporters appear promising.
The Spanish market for pulse products is poised for growth in all areas in the coming years.
Both processed pulse products, particularly canned products, and raw pulse products that can be processed in Spain's growing food-processing industry offer potential to Canadian suppliers.
• Private-label products represent an excellent opportunity for retailers to generate increased profits and distinguish themselves from competitors.
In 2000, privatelabel brands represented sales of $6.7 billion for the major supermarkets; an increase of 18% from 1999.
With the growing demand for private-label goods in Spain, retailers are actively looking for new or unique products in nearly all product categories, particularly canned vegetables including legumes.
With its commitment to high quality and competitive pricing, the Canadian food industry is well-positioned to capture a large share of the private-label market.
• Spain's hotel, restaurant and institutional (HRI) sector is also expected to grow in the coming years and will require imports.
The most popular ethnic food is Tex- Mex, in which pulse products are a central ingredient.
As Spaniards move toward the trend of eating out, key staple ingredients, such as pulses, will be required by the HRI sector.
• At the global level, Canada is the world's largest exporter of dry peas, lentils and chick peas.
It also holds a significant share of the world's exports of dry beans.
In 2001, pulse imports from Canada totalled over $75 million.
Other leading foreign competitors include Mexico, Argentina, the United States and the United Kingdom.
• With sales of $968 822 in 2001, Canada ranks fourth in supplies of fresh or chilled leguminous vegetables to Spain, behind France ($10.3 million), Morocco ($6.9 million) and Argentina ($1 million).
• The United States accounts for 95% of pardina lentils consumed in Spain.
Because of their high yields and subsequent low prices, pardinas could be a threat to Canadian pulse products in the future.
• Another potential competitive threat faced by Canadian and other pulse producers concerns the new U.S. Farm Bill that includes a Loan Deficiency Payment (LDP) for pulses (chick peas, lentils and peas).
The inclusion of a LDP in the Farm Bill means that U.S. farmers are guaranteed returns, regardless of the world market price for these pulse crops.
Not only are these subsidies significantly higher than the average world price for these crops over the last ten years, but prices are likely to decline even further with the increased production in the U.S. following the implementation of the new bill.
This bill will not only affect Canadian exporters but all producers/exporters of pulse products.
• The average Spanish household comprises an urban, dual-income earning family of four people.
Approximately 65% of households have a microwave and almost all homes have a refrigerator.
• Spanish consumers are health conscious and have an increasing interest in low cholesterol, low-fat and high-fibre products.
Demand for organic products is also growing.
As a result of problems with BSE throughout the European Union, consumers are now more than ever concerned about food safety and therefore place a premium on quality.
• The traditional Mediterranean diet is slowly being replaced with North American eating habits.
Several factors are responsible for this change: urbanization, an increase in the percentage of women in the work force, and the shift from traditional daily purchases to less frequent visits to large supermarkets.
As a result, the demand for convenient yet healthy, prepared food has risen.
Ready meals using pulse products are popular in Spain.
The Spanish ready meal market in 2000 was $567 million.
• Spain's food distribution sector is well-developed but dominated by a few major companies.
The traditional retail sector, made up of small retail traders, has diminished with supermarkets and hypermarkets accounting for approximately 85% of food sales in the country.
• The leading hypermarkets include Alcampo, Grupo Carrefour, Continente, Eroski, Pryca and Hipercor/El Corte Incles.
In recent years, the number of hypermarkets has declined, from a 3.5% market share to 31.8%, while the number of medium-sized supermarkets and discount outlets has increased.
Medium-sized supermarkets, with an area of between 401 and 1000 square metres, hold the highest market share (27.3%).
The leading chains include Cadena CMD, Euromadi, Ifa Espanola and Unide.
• The Spanish food-processing sector comprises 5.5% of the country's GDP.
It represents roughly 20% of the country's total industrial production and employs 17% of the total work force.
There are approximately 38 000 food-processing plants in Spain, including 559 fruit and vegetable processing centres.
Total food production was valued at $80 billion in 2000, accounting for 10% of total EU agrifood production.
Nestle Espana S.A. is the largest food-processing company operating in the country.
Other major food-processing companies include Campofrio Alimentacion S.A. and Azucarerea Ebro Agricolas.
• Spain's foodservice sector, which comprises commercial (hotels, restaurants and bars) and institutional (cafeterias in schools, universities, prisons, the army and hospitals) foodservice outlets, accounts for 26.4% of food consumed in Spain.
On average there is one food outlet per 173 people.
Although fast food is the leading area in the restaurant sector, opportunities for exporters are likely to be found in bars, hotels and traditional restaurants.
Leading domestic restaurants groups include Areas S.A., Sigla S.A., El Corte Ingles, Euronow S.L., and Grupo Moncho's.
Opportunities for consumer-ready pulse products might also be available in institutional foodservices.
The leading groups in this category include Eurest Colectividades S.A., Sodexho España S.A., Aramark Servicios de Catering S.L., Serunion S.A., Grupo Osesa S.A., Vanyera S.A., Restauracion
• Foreign firms employ a variety of channels to distribute their products and services in Spain.
The most common method of distribution is through the appointment of an agent or distributor.
Other channels of distribution include selling through wholesalers and dealers, and establishing a sales office in Madrid or Barcelona.
Marketing products directly to retail outlets is not a common practice.
However some supermarket chains3 will directly import certain products, such as pulses, to be repackaged in their warehouses.
It is important for Canadian companies to ensure that qualified, in-country representation is available to meet customers' needs.
Canadian companies are advised to consult the Canadian Embassy in Madrid for assistance in identifying reliable agents and distributors in the agri-food sector.
• Trade fairs can serve as a launching pad for the introduction of products to Spain.
Alimentaria, an international food and drink fair that alternates between Barcelona and Lisbon every spring, is largest agri-food trade show held in the country.
• As a member of the European Union, Spain does not have bilateral trade agreements with any developed nation.
EU members share a common agricultural policy, a joint transportation policy, free movement of goods and capital within member states and a common tariff on imported products coming from non-EU countries.
While customs duty rates are the same for all 15 EU countries, the value-added tax (VAT) on products and services usually differ from country to country.
These taxes are levied in the country of final destination, which is 16% in Spain.
However, Spain has a reduced VAT of 7% which is applied to agriculture products.
Import licences are also required.
They are issued by the registrar general of the Secretariat of Trade in Spain and are valid only for six months.
The request for an import licence must be accompanied by an invoice listing transportation and insurance fees, the cost, insurance and freight (c.i.f.) price, the net and gross weights, and the invoice number.
• The following label information is mandatory and must be printed in Spanish on all packaging: product name, list of ingredients, net weight or net volume (in metric), directions for storage and use, expiration date, country of origin, name of the importer, and lot number.
A sticker containing all mandatory information may also be used.
Nutritional labelling is not compulsory except when a nutrition claim is made in the labelling, presentation or advertising of the product or when it is required by another EU directive.
Further information on labelling requirements can be found on the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Web site at http://ats.agr.ca/info/europe/e1429.htm.
• According to the Spanish Ministry of Health and Consumption (Ministerio de Sanidad y Consumo) raw products (dried or caned) do not require a phytosanitary certificate.
Processed pulses, however, require a Sanitary Certificate of Origin (Certificado sanitario de origen).
• The European Union is in the process of developing EU-wide maximum residue levels (MRLs) for most commonly used pesticides.
The first series of MRLs was adopted in July 1993.
Additional information can be obtained from European Union Online: http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/ph_ps/pro/ eva/existing/index_en.htm
• Documents that need to be authenticated, such as certificates of sale and letters authorizing an exporter's local agent or importer to act on their behalf, must first be notarized in Canada.
At no cost to the exporter, the notarized documents can be authenticated by sending them to the Authentication and Service of Documents (JLAC) of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.
• For statistical purposes, Canada requires exporters to complete an Export Declaration (Form B13A).
It can be filled in and sent electronically to the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency ( http://www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca/E/pbg/cf/b13abq ).
See APPENDIX A for the export codes required for B13A.
More information about the CSCA and the services it provides can be obtained on their Web site at http://www.specialcrops.mb.ca.
• The Canadian Grain Commission (CGC) is responsible for the maintenance of quality for Canadian crops including dry peas, lentils, dry beans and chick peas.

MARKET OVERVIEW Spain offers an attractive consumer market for foreign products and services in virtually every sector.
The country has a growing gross domestic product, valued at just over $1.1 trillion(2) in 2002, and a population exceeding 40 million people.
Since joining the European Union (EU) in 1986, Spanish fisheries have been faced with fishing quotas, thus declining domestic fish stocks.
The domestic fish and seafood catch in Spain comprises blue fish, hake and whiting, cod, tuna, squid, octopus and mussels.
In the first half of 2002, the amount of fresh fish caught dropped by approximately 8% since the same period in 2001.
In total, Spain's catch quota for 2002 decreased by 17%.
In November 2002, a vessel carrying in excess of 20 million gallons of fuel oil sank approximately 150 miles from Spain's Atlantic coast, crippling the wildlife and fishing industry in the Galicia province.
This disaster is expected to have a significant effect on Spain's domestic fish and seafood supply, as the spill is anticipated to reach the southern waters, where the world's largest mussel beds are located.
Spain is the world's second-largest producer of mussels, accounting for 15% of global supply.
The effects of the spill are expected to last for a number of years as fish and shellfish in and near the contaminated water will be spoiled.
As a result of EU fishing quotas and the oil spill, Spanish imports of fish and seafood products are expected to continue to rise.
In 2002, fish and seafood imports were valued in excess of $5.6 billion, a 17% increase over 2000.
Fish and seafood imports accounted for 2% of total imports to Spain.
Crustaceans represented over one quarter of fish and seafood imports, with shrimps, crawfish and lobster comprising an 86% share of imported crustaceans.
Spain also imports significant quantities of fresh fish and seafood.
In 2002, imports of fresh and live fish and seafood amounted to over $2.3 billion, accounting for almost 42% of total fish and seafood imports.
Popular imported varieties included salmon, flatfish, sole and tuna (used for processing), squid, octopus, scallops, mussels and oysters.
As the second-largest consumer of fish and seafood in the world behind Japan, Spain could be a very lucrative market for Canadian fish and seafood suppliers.
In 2001, Spain consumed 1.8 million tonnes of fish and seafood products.
Fresh fish represented the largest market, accounting for over half of total seafood consumption, followed by fresh shellfish and molluscs (16%), canned and cured seafood products (14%), frozen fish (11%), frozen shellfish and molluscs (8%) and cooked shellfish and molluscs (1%).
Consumers favour hake and whiting, which accounted for just over 21% of fresh fish and 54% of frozen fish consumption in 2001.
Other fish and seafood products that appeal to the Spanish consumer include fresh sardines, mussels, squid and octopus, frozen shrimp and prawns, and canned tuna.
Market Trends Fish and seafood are already staple commodities in the Spanish diet, with approximately 14% of household food expenditures allocated to the purchase of fish and seafood.
However, consumer demand is expected to increase due to shifting lifestyles of the Spanish population.
In particular, health scares caused by cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) have heightened consumers' health consciousness and they are now looking for healthy alternatives to beef.
While the propensity for consumers to eat seafood at home has decreased marginally over the last six years, the increasing number of working women has caused a rise in the consumption of fish and seafood in restaurants.
In addition, Spain has a growing ageing population with over 17% aged 65 years old or older.
It is forecast that one fifth of the Spanish population will be 65 years old or older by 2005.
These consumers have a higher propensity to eat and purchase healthier foods and will, eventually, further increase the demand for fish and seafood products.
Price is generally a significant decision-making factor for the typical Spanish consumer, however, Spain's "Mediterranean diet" favours fresh seafood products.
OPPORTUNITIES Canadian fish and seafood companies interested in exporting their products to Spain will find opportunities particularly prosperous during the summer months (April to July), when tourism is at its peak and demand from the hospitality industry is high for quality food products.
Tourism is a huge industry in Spain, which receives over 50 million tourists each year.
Exporters will also find the Christmas season (November to December) prosperous as it is the biggest seafood consumption period in Spain.
Furthermore, Canadian companies should target the regions of Madrid, Aragon, Andalucia and Northern Spain, where per-capita consumption of fish and seafood is at its greatest.
Fish and seafood varieties that present good market potential include fresh hake, whiting, fresh lobster, frozen squid, surimi and frozen fish.
Furthermore the increasing number of women in the work force will spur on demand for ready-to-eat seafood products.
The environmental disaster along Spain's Atlantic coast caused by the sunken oil tanker presents exporting opportunities for Canadian fisheries to supply fresh fish, mussels and shrimp to the Spanish market.
Closures of canning plants have been anticipated by the Spanish National Fish and Seafood Canners Association as a result of insufficient fish and seafood raw materials due to the oil spill and EU fishing quotas.
Consequently, there is potential for an increase in imports to raise fish and seafood levels.
Opportunities also exist for exporters of frozen squid.
In January 2002, domestic production reached approximately 23 000 tonnes, almost a 10% increase from the previous year.
However, as the European Union continues to impose catch quotas, domestic production of squid is expected to decline while demand for this product is anticipated to remain relatively steady at over 98 000 tonnes a year.
Canadian suppliers should appoint a local agent or distributor who is familiar with import regulations and licensing requirements.
Some international companies may also find it easier to conduct business in Spain by setting up a local office in one of the country's major business centres, Madrid or Barcelona.

KEY PARTICIPANTS Supermarkets account for the largest segment of fish sales, with 43% of the market, followed by open fish markets (31%), hotels, restaurants and institutions (23%) and small independent retailers (3%).
As Spain is an avid importer of fish and seafood products, international suppliers play a key role in the Spanish market.
While not one foreign supplier dominates the import market, exporters from EU member countries account for over half of fish and seafood imports to Spain.
Morocco and Argentina are the largest single suppliers, with approximately 8.6% and 8.5% of import share, respectively, followed by France (7.7%), the United Kingdom (6.1%) and the Netherlands (5.7%).
The United States--Canada's key competitor in this market--is the 15th largest fish and seafood supplier to Spain with imports valued in excess of $97 million.
Canada is the sixth largest provider of frozen seafood products behind China, Norway, Iceland, Chile and Germany.
Crustacean imports are supplied primarily by Argentina, the United Kingdom and Cuba, while Morocco, India and Italy dominate seafood imports for products such as squid, octopus and scallops.
Fresh fish is supplied primarily by surrounding EU member countries such as France, Denmark, Greece and the United Kingdom.
Canadian Position In 2002, Spain imported nearly $36 million in fish and seafood products from Canada, accounting for 4% of Spain's total imports from Canada.
Canada mainly supplies fresh or chilled hake and fresh, chilled, dried or salted lobsters, which together account for 85% of Canadian fish and seafood exports to Spain.
In 2002, Spanish imports of Canadian lobster amounted to $14.4 million, increasing over 170% since 2000.
PRIVATE- AND PUBLIC-SECTOR CUSTOMERS Many fishmongers, retailers and food producers purchase fresh and frozen fish and seafood products through one of the 22 MERCAs in Spain or through one of the central city markets.
MERCA is a state-owned central market for fish and seafood, fruit and vegetables and meat, funded by Madrid city council and a local company, MERCASA.
Mercamadrid is one of the biggest wholesale markets in Spain with a large area (42 600 square metres) allocated for selling seafood products.
In 2001, fish and seafood sales at Mercamadrid exceeded $1.1 billion.
The vast majority of volume sales were in fresh fish products, accounting for 66% of all fish and seafood sold, followed by frozen fish and seafood products (23%) and fresh shellfish (11%).
Canadian companies should communicate with the local seafood importer's association located at each MERCA, to access Spanish distributors at the seafood market.
The Seafood Wholesaler Association of Mercamadrid is the largest association which handles more than 50% of seafood transit to Spain via the MERCAs network (see Key Contacts).
For more information about Mercamadrid, visit their Web site http://www.mercamadrid.es. Barriers to accessing the Spanish market are generally those that apply to the European Union as a whole.
Canadian exporters should consult the Canadian Food Inspection Agency regarding any certification requirement.
Canadian companies will also find information regarding labelling requirements on the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Web site at http://ats.agr.ca/info/europe-e.htm.

MARKET OVERVIEW The United Kingdom's agri-food sector is a lucrative market with over 60 million consumers and one of the world's most sophisticated retail sectors.
The U.K. grocery market (including non-food sales) was valued at over $230 billion(2) in 2001 and is expected to continue its healthy growth in the future.
In 2002, retail sales of organic food and beverages increased by almost 20% from 2001, albeit a somewhat lower rate than the previous few years.
The U.K. organic market was valued at $2.3 billion in 2002, with over 65% of products being imported.
Sales of organic food and beverages represent between 2% and 3% of total food sales in the United Kingdom.
However, the U.K. government, supermarkets and Soil Association are attempting to boost this share to 10% by 2010.
The organic market in the United Kingdom is estimated to reach approximately $2.7 billion in 2003 and increase by 75% over 2002 figures by 2007.
The surge in demand for organic food in 2000 was undoubtedly fuelled by a series of food safety scares including bovine spongiform encepahalopathy (BSE), salmonella and Foot and Mouth Disease, as well as, concern about, and resistance to, the introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
Furthermore, consumers were increasingly being educated about organic products, and several food manufacturers were launching new organic products and relaunching existing ones.
Demand for organics continues to experience strong growth, however growth rates have slowed over the last few years.
As the market for organic food and beverages matures, boundaries between health foods and mainstream foods are becoming increasingly blurred.
A number of new sectors--including sports nutrition and functional foods--have developed in response to consumer interest in their health and what they eat.
While 77.7% of U.K. households have purchased organic products, a mere 4% of the population are considered loyal consumers of organic foods.
With increased education about organic products, this percentage is anticipated to grow to 19% in 2007.
Typical consumers of organic food in the United Kingdom include its growing number of seniors (aged 50-70) and young families.
A health-conscious ageing population who believes in the benefits of eating organic foods has pushed up demand for organics within this target market.
Moreover, demand for organic baby products is booming, accounting for half of total baby food sales.
As the second-largest organic market in Europe, the United Kingdom offers a wide variety of organic products.
Fruits and vegetables is the biggest segment, accounting for 29% of the market in 2002.
The next-largest segment, dairy products, accounted for 19% of domestic sales, followed closely by organic processed foods (16%), cereals and baked goods (13%), baby foods (7%), meat and meat products (6%) and eggs (5%) in 2002.
Organic beverages, including organic teas, coffee and fruit juices, accounted for 5% of the market.
In 2002, the market for organic beverages amounted to approximately $113 million, increasing 20% over the previous year.
Growth in staple foods is slowing, giving rise to organic variations of convenience meals, processed foods and prepared foods such as yogurts, bakery items, breakfast cereals, sauces and fruit juices.
Organic meat and meat products experienced the greatest growth in 2002, reaching a market value of $137 million, a 45% jump over 2001.
However, growth levels of organic meat was lower than in previous years.
There has been a surge in organic baby foods with the market value rising 37% to over $158 million.
Other high growth areas of the U.K. organic sector include cereals and baked goods, which increased 34% to $295 million, and organic processed foods and dairy products--each growing 23% over 2001.
The July 2002 Organic Action Plan indicates strong support from the U.K. government to protect the domestic organic market.
Investments in converting arable land to fully organic land are rising.
According to the Department of Environment, Food and Agriculture (Defra) there were 536 866 hectares of organic land in the United Kingdom, with a further 204 308 hectares in-conversion in March 2003.
Organic land accounts for only 4% of total arable land in the United Kingdom.
With the increased effort to support domestic production and supply of organic products, the level of imports is anticipated to decline.
However, imports are expected to continue to play a significant role in the U.K. organic market as consumer expectations grow.
Leading organic food imports include fruits and vegetables, cereals and bakery items, multi-ingredient foods and beverages--each of which holds more than 75% of their subsector import share.
Furthermore, approximately 50% of organic baby food is imported in the United Kingdom, as well as 45% of organic meat.
Market-Access Considerations Many European growers and farmers have converted to organic methods of production, so competition for the supply of organic fruits and vegetables is relatively high.
Furthermore, discussions of depleting nutritional values from shipping organic products over long distances have raised concerns about the vitality of non-European organic products.
Organic exports to the United Kingdom also require certification that they meet EU organic standards.
OPPORTUNITIES Although the U.K. government is attempting to reduce the level of imports, continued growth in its organic sector will provide Canadian exporters with abundant opportunities to supply a wide variety of organic foods.
Canadian companies will find good potential in supplying organic versions of Canadian products already offered in the U.K. market, such as breadmaking wheat, grains, pulses, apples, cheese and niche products.
Many primary products are sold to manufacturers for further processing.
Highly competitive importers and grocery retailers are progressively searching for quality, novel/innovative organic variations of traditional grocery products to expand their organic food and beverage product offerings.
Furthermore, consumers' continued demand for convenience presents opportunities for organic processed foods and beverages such as ready meals, baby food, yogurt, breakfast cereal, biscuits, sauces, condiments, tea and fruit juices.
Moreover, demand for healthy convenience foods or functional foods is largely influenced by the increased popularity of Britains eating out or eating on-the-go.
In 2002, the propensity for Britains to eat on-the-go was 22% and is forecast to rise to 25% by 2007.
There is a definite lack of healthy convenient options available in the U.K., with only 31% of British consumers who eat on-the-go finding healthy meals.
As a result, Canadian food manufacturers will find opportunities to supply a wide range of healthy/functional organic foods and drinks to the U.K. market.
While regulations and requirements may sometimes seem daunting, Canadian companies have done well exporting to the United Kingdom and have carved out some important market niches.
The United Kingdom is Canada's eighth-largest agricultural trading partner, ranking seventh as an export market and eighth as a source for imports.
In 2002, bilateral trade exceeded $620 million.
Furthermore, Canada offers high reliability, compared to many alternative non-EU suppliers, and quality guarantees that are second to none.
The Government of Canada has several programs to help Canadian firms gain a competitive advantage in international markets.
For instance, Export Development Canada (EDC) offers export financing and insurance to Canadian exporters.
Exporters may also find financial and other assistance through the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade's Program for Export Market Development.

KEY PARTICIPANTS The organic food and beverages market in the United Kingdom is characterized by a large number of small organic growers/producers and processors.
However, high growth in the organic sector has attracted large food manufacturers such as Heinz, Masterfoods, RHM and Gerber Foods to the market--mostly through the acquisition of a smaller organic supplier.
Given the shared food and beverage standards and regulations within the European Union and reduced transportation costs associated with the close proximity of member countries, EU member countries are leading suppliers of organic food and beverages to the United Kingdom, most notably Denmark, Sweden, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria and Germany.
Approximately 70% of organic food sold in U.K. supermarkets is labelled with the Soil Association name and logo.
In April 2003, Defra appointed a new Advisory Committee on Organic Food and Farming (ACOFF) to govern organic standards in the United Kingdom, administer approvals of organic certifying bodies and implement the U.K.'s Organic Action Plan.
ACOFF replaces the role of the United Kingdom Register of Organic Food Standards.
PRIVATE-SECTOR CUSTOMERS The U.K. food distribution system is highly concentrated, as consumers look increasingly for one-stop shopping.
The main distribution channel for organic foods and beverages in the United Kingdom are major supermarkets, which account for 85% of organic food sales.
While the distribution system is largely dominated by retailers, U.K. retailers rarely buy products direct from overseas companies.
Canadian exporters will find more ease in entering the U.K. market by appointing a local distribution partner.
These companies purchase organic products for further processing or redistribute the products to supermarkets, hypermarkets and other retail outlets.
Furthermore, a distribution partner will have a better understanding of the market and know how to promote organic food products effectively in the United Kingdom.
For a list of local organic importers, contact the Canadian High Commission in London.
The main supermarket chains leading the organic food and beverage market in the United Kingdom are Sainsbury's, Waitrose and Tesco.
In 2002, Sainsbury's organic food sales amounted to nearly $555 million or 20% of the total market.
Sainsbury offers more than 1300 organic products.
With the organics market slowly maturing, competitive pricing and positioning have become significant factors to British buyers.
In addition, although hotels, restaurant and caterers (HORECA) are slow to adapt to the rise of organic products, the HORECA industry is an alternative customer with great growth potential.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY With a population of 60 million, the United Kingdom is the third-largest economy in Western Europe and represents a growing market for health products.
A general trend toward health-consciousness, combined with demographic factors such as stabilizing levels of income and an ageing population, have resulted in an increasingly healthconscious consumer base.
Moreover, with the increased use of preventative medicines and self-treatments and constraints on health-care funding, the United Kingdom is a significant market for nutraceutical products.
Demand for nutraceutical compounds is expected to reach $579.6 million1 by 2006-an annual increase of 5.5% over 2001 totals.
The best prospects for Canadian companies in the United Kingdom lie in the export of nutraceutical products that target particular ailments, life stages or lifestyles.
Key product areas include ginkgo biloba, ginseng, echinacea, multivitamins, childrenspecific vitamins and sports supplements.
There are also potential opportunities for products intended for rebranding.
Domestic manufacturers dominate production of nutraceuticals in the United Kingdom.
However, foreign manufacturers, especially from the United States, Switzerland and the Netherlands, are gaining an increased share of this growing market.
Canadian producers represent only a small portion of the total market.
However, from January to August 2002, Canada's exports of vitamins to the United Kingdom reached $46 000, equaling total nutraceutical exports for 2001.
The main distribution channels for vitamins and dietary supplements include pharmacies, grocery stores and health-food stores.
In 2001, supermarkets accounted for 30% of retail sales of nutraceuticals.
With the growing trend of in-store pharmacies, supermarkets are expected to become the dominant retail channel for nutraceutical products.
MARKET OVERVIEW The United Kingdom recorded a gross domestic product (GDP) of $2.1 trillion in 2001.
